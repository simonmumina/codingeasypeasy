# @mantine/spotlight: Supercharge Your React App with a Powerful Search and Navigation Experience

In today's dynamic web applications, providing users with a seamless and efficient way to navigate and find information is paramount. The `@mantine/spotlight` package from the Mantine UI library offers a fantastic solution for building a global search and navigation component, often referred to as a "spotlight" or "quick switcher," that significantly enhances user experience. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively utilize `@mantine/spotlight` in your React projects.

## What is @mantine/spotlight?

`@mantine/spotlight` is a component within the Mantine UI ecosystem that allows you to create a modal window activated by a keyboard shortcut (typically `Cmd/Ctrl + K`) or a button click. This modal provides a centralized interface for searching across your application's content and navigating to different sections or performing actions.

**Key Features:**

- **Global Search:** Enable users to quickly search across your entire application, finding specific pages, components, or data.
- **Navigation:** Provide a fast way to navigate between different parts of your application, reducing clicks and improving efficiency.
- **Customizable Actions:** Define custom actions that users can trigger directly from the spotlight, such as creating a new item, accessing settings, or running commands.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Intuitive keyboard-based navigation makes the spotlight highly efficient for power users.
- **Mantine UI Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the rest of the Mantine UI library, providing a consistent look and feel.
- **Accessibility:** Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a usable experience for all users.
- **Theming:** Inherits Mantine's theme and allows for further customization through CSS.

## Installation

First, ensure you have Mantine UI core components and hooks installed:

```plaintext
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/spotlight
# or
yarn add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/spotlight
# or
pnpm add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/spotlight
```

Make sure your app is wrapped with `MantineProvider`. This is essential for the component to access theme context and styles.

```jsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core'

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={{ colorScheme: 'light' }}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

## Basic Usage

Let's create a simple spotlight component with a few example actions.

```jsx
import { SpotlightProvider, SpotlightAction } from '@mantine/spotlight';
import { Button } from '@mantine/core';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [opened, setOpened] = useState(false);

  const actions: SpotlightAction[] = [
    {
      title: 'Home',
      description: 'Navigate to the home page',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Navigating to Home'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
    {
      title: 'Settings',
      description: 'Open the settings panel',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Opening Settings'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
    {
      title: 'Help',
      description: 'Access the help documentation',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Opening Help'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
  ];

  return (
    <SpotlightProvider actions={actions} opened={opened} onOpen={() => setOpened(true)} onClose={() => setOpened(false)}>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpened(true)}>Open Spotlight</Button>
    </SpotlightProvider>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example:

- We import `SpotlightProvider` and `SpotlightAction` from `@mantine/spotlight`.
- We define an array of `SpotlightAction` objects, each representing a searchable action. Each action includes:
  - `title`: The title of the action displayed in the spotlight.
  - `description`: A brief description of what the action does.
  - `onTrigger`: A function that is executed when the action is selected. Importantly, we close the spotlight after the action is triggered using `setOpened(false)`. Replace `alert()` with your actual routing or action logic.
- We wrap our button (or potentially your entire application) with `SpotlightProvider`.
- We pass the `actions` array, the `opened` state, the `onOpen` and `onClose` handlers to the `SpotlightProvider`.

**Explanation:**

- **SpotlightProvider:** This component provides the context for the spotlight functionality. It manages the spotlight's state (open/closed), actions, and search logic.
- **SpotlightAction:** This type defines the structure of a single action within the spotlight. You define the title, description, and what happens when the action is triggered.
- **opened, onOpen, onClose:** These properties control the visibility of the spotlight. We manage them with `useState`. You can trigger `onOpen` when a button is clicked, or (as we'll see later) when a keyboard shortcut is pressed.

## Adding Keyboard Shortcut

Let's add a global keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + K) to open the spotlight. We'll use the `@mantine/hooks` library for this.

```jsx
import { SpotlightProvider, SpotlightAction } from '@mantine/spotlight';
import { Button } from '@mantine/core';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useHotkeys } from '@mantine/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const [opened, setOpened] = useState(false);

  const actions: SpotlightAction[] = [
    {
      title: 'Home',
      description: 'Navigate to the home page',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Navigating to Home'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
    {
      title: 'Settings',
      description: 'Open the settings panel',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Opening Settings'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
    {
      title: 'Help',
      description: 'Access the help documentation',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Opening Help'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
  ];

  useHotkeys([['mod+k', () => setOpened((o) => !o)]]); // mod = Cmd on macOS, Ctrl on other systems

  return (
    <SpotlightProvider actions={actions} opened={opened} onOpen={() => setOpened(true)} onClose={() => setOpened(false)}>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpened(true)}>Open Spotlight</Button>
    </SpotlightProvider>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

We've added:

- `useHotkeys` from `@mantine/hooks`.
- `useHotkeys([['mod+k', () => setOpened((o) => !o)]]);` This registers a global hotkey. `mod` automatically resolves to `Cmd` on macOS and `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux. When the hotkey is pressed, it toggles the `opened` state.

Now, pressing `Cmd/Ctrl + K` will open and close the spotlight.

## Dynamic Actions and Data Fetching

In real-world applications, your spotlight actions will often be dynamic, based on data fetched from an API or database. Let's simulate this with a `useEffect` hook.

```jsx
import { SpotlightProvider, SpotlightAction } from '@mantine/spotlight';
import { Button } from '@mantine/core';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useHotkeys } from '@mantine/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const [opened, setOpened] = useState(false);
  const [dynamicActions, setDynamicActions] = useState<SpotlightAction[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate fetching data from an API
    setTimeout(() => {
      const fetchedData = [
        { id: 1, title: 'Article 1', description: 'A great article about React' },
        { id: 2, title: 'Article 2', description: 'Another interesting article on Mantine' },
      ];

      const newActions = fetchedData.map((item) => ({
        title: item.title,
        description: item.description,
        onTrigger: () => {
          alert(`Navigating to Article ${item.id}`); // Replace with actual navigation logic
          setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
        },
      }));

      setDynamicActions(newActions);
    }, 500); // Simulate a 500ms API delay
  }, []);

  const actions: SpotlightAction[] = [
    {
      title: 'Home',
      description: 'Navigate to the home page',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Navigating to Home'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
    {
      title: 'Settings',
      description: 'Open the settings panel',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Opening Settings'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
    {
      title: 'Help',
      description: 'Access the help documentation',
      onTrigger: () => {
        alert('Opening Help'); // Replace with actual navigation logic
        setOpened(false); // Close the spotlight
      },
    },
    ...dynamicActions, // Add dynamic actions to the list
  ];

  useHotkeys([['mod+k', () => setOpened((o) => !o)]]); // mod = Cmd on macOS, Ctrl on other systems

  return (
    <SpotlightProvider actions={actions} opened={opened} onOpen={() => setOpened(true)} onClose={() => setOpened(false)}>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpened(true)}>Open Spotlight</Button>
    </SpotlightProvider>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Key changes:

- We introduce `dynamicActions` state to hold the fetched actions.
- A `useEffect` hook simulates fetching data and transforming it into `SpotlightAction` objects.
- We use the spread operator (`...dynamicActions`) to merge the dynamic actions with the static ones.

Now, the spotlight will initially show only the "Home," "Settings," and "Help" actions. After 500ms (simulating the API delay), the article actions will appear.

## Customizing the Appearance

Mantine UI provides various ways to customize the appearance of the spotlight. You can leverage Mantine's theme or apply custom CSS.

**1. Theming with Mantine's Theme Provider:**

You can modify the default colors, fonts, and other theme properties within your `MantineProvider`. For example:

```jsx
import { MantineProvider, SpotlightProvider, SpotlightAction } from '@mantine/core'

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MantineProvider
      withGlobalStyles
      withNormalizeCSS
      theme={{
        colorScheme: 'light',
        colors: {
          brand: [
            '#228BE6',
            '#339AF0',
            '#495057',
            '#5F6368',
            '#74787D',
            '#898D92',
            '#9EA2A7',
            '#B3B7BC',
            '#C8CDD2',
            '#DDE2E7',
          ],
        },
        primaryColor: 'brand',
      }}
    >
      {/*  Your Component with SpotlightProvider inside*/}
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

This example defines a custom color palette named `brand` and sets the primary color to `brand`. The spotlight and other Mantine components will automatically inherit these theme settings.

**2. Styling with `sx` Prop:**

You can use the `sx` prop to apply CSS styles directly to the `SpotlightProvider` or any of its children.

```jsx
<SpotlightProvider
  actions={actions}
  opened={opened}
  onOpen={() => setOpened(true)}
  onClose={() => setOpened(false)}
  sx={{
    '.mantine-Spotlight-root': {
      backgroundColor: '#f0f2f5',
    },
    '.mantine-Spotlight-searchInput': {
      backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
      border: '1px solid #ced4da',
    },
  }}
>
  {/* Your Component */}
</SpotlightProvider>
```

This example changes the background color of the spotlight root and the search input. Remember to inspect the DOM to find the correct class names to target specific elements.

**3. Customizing Components:**

You can also access individual components within the spotlight to apply custom styling. For example, you could style the action items. This requires deeper knowledge of how Mantine's components are structured and may involve overriding default styles. Generally, the `sx` prop is easier and more maintainable for most customizations.

## Advanced Features

- **Filter Function:** The `filter` prop on the `SpotlightProvider` allows you to define a custom function to filter the actions based on the user's input. This gives you fine-grained control over the search behavior.

- **Category Headers:** You can group your actions under category headers for better organization. This involves adding a `category` property to your `SpotlightAction` objects and rendering them appropriately.

- **Custom Search Input:** While the default search input is functional, you can replace it with your own custom input component.

- **Accessibility Considerations:** Ensure your `SpotlightAction` descriptions are descriptive and provide sufficient context for screen reader users.

## Best Practices

- **Optimize Action Descriptions:** Write clear and concise descriptions for your actions. These descriptions help users understand what each action does and improve searchability.
- **Limit the Number of Actions:** Avoid overwhelming users with too many actions. Prioritize the most commonly used actions and consider using categories to group related actions.
- **Provide Visual Feedback:** Clearly indicate when the spotlight is open and when an action has been triggered.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test the spotlight on different devices and browsers to ensure a consistent experience.
- **Consider Performance:** If you have a large number of actions, optimize the search and filtering logic to avoid performance issues.
- **Consistent Styling:** Ensure the spotlight's styling matches your application's overall design.

## Conclusion

The `@mantine/spotlight` package provides a powerful and versatile way to enhance the navigation and search experience in your React applications. By leveraging its features and customizing it to your specific needs, you can create a highly efficient and user-friendly interface that significantly improves productivity. Remember to prioritize clear action descriptions, optimize performance, and maintain a consistent visual style. Happy coding!
