# MySQL WEEKOFYEAR(): Mastering Week Number Calculation with Examples

The `WEEKOFYEAR()` function in MySQL is a powerful tool for extracting the week number from a given date. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide to using this function, including its syntax, different modes, and practical examples. Understanding `WEEKOFYEAR()` is crucial for applications that require week-based reporting, scheduling, or data analysis.

## What is the MySQL `WEEKOFYEAR()` Function?

The `WEEKOFYEAR()` function returns the week number for a given date. The return value ranges from 1 to 53, representing the week of the year. The specific week numbering system used depends on the `mode` argument (which is optional), but by default, it typically adheres to the ISO 8601 standard where the first week of the year contains January 4th.

## Syntax

The syntax of the `WEEKOFYEAR()` function is straightforward:

```sql
WEEKOFYEAR(date)
```

Where `date` is the date or datetime expression from which you want to extract the week number.

## Basic Usage

Let's start with a simple example:

```sql
SELECT WEEKOFYEAR('2024-10-27');
```

This query will return `43`, indicating that October 27th, 2024, falls in the 43rd week of the year.

## Understanding the Importance of `mode` (and Why it's Missing)

Unlike the more general `WEEK()` function in MySQL, `WEEKOFYEAR()` *does not* accept a `mode` argument.  This is a crucial difference.  `WEEKOFYEAR()` always uses `mode 3` which corresponds to ISO 8601 week numbering.

* **ISO 8601 Week Numbering:**  This is the internationally recognized standard for representing weeks. The first week of the year is defined as the week that contains the first Thursday of January, or equivalently, the week that contains January 4th. Weeks run from Monday to Sunday.  This means the first few days of January might belong to the last week of the *previous* year, and the last few days of December might belong to the first week of the *next* year.

Because `WEEKOFYEAR()` is locked into this specific numbering scheme, the results will be consistent across different MySQL servers and database implementations (assuming they adhere to ISO 8601 standards).

## Practical Examples

Let's look at some practical examples of how to use `WEEKOFYEAR()` in your SQL queries.

### Example 1: Selecting Data for a Specific Week

Imagine you have a table called `orders` with a `order_date` column. You can use `WEEKOFYEAR()` to select all orders placed in a specific week:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE WEEKOFYEAR(order_date) = 1; -- Select orders from the first week of the year (ISO 8601)
```

### Example 2: Grouping Data by Week

You can group data by week to generate weekly reports:

```sql
SELECT WEEKOFYEAR(order_date) AS week_number,
       SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024
GROUP BY week_number
ORDER BY week_number;
```

This query calculates the total sales for each week in 2024, grouped by the week number returned by `WEEKOFYEAR()`. The `YEAR(order_date)` filter ensures that you're only grouping data from the desired year.

### Example 3: Combining `WEEKOFYEAR()` with `YEAR()` for Unique Identification

When dealing with data across multiple years, using just `WEEKOFYEAR()` might lead to ambiguity, as week numbers repeat yearly. Combine it with `YEAR()` for unique week identification:

```sql
SELECT
    YEAR(order_date) AS order_year,
    WEEKOFYEAR(order_date) AS order_week,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_year, order_week
ORDER BY order_year, order_week;
```

This provides a more accurate representation of weekly data over multiple years.

### Example 4: Using `WEEKOFYEAR()` in a `WHERE` clause with date ranges

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales_data
WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2024
  AND WEEKOFYEAR(sale_date) BETWEEN 10 AND 15;
```

This will select all sales data from the year 2024 that occurred between the 10th and 15th weeks of the year.

### Example 5: Integrating with other Date functions

```sql
SELECT order_date,
       WEEKOFYEAR(order_date) AS week_number,
       DAYOFWEEK(order_date) AS day_of_week
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024 AND WEEKOFYEAR(order_date) = 44;
```

This example shows how to combine `WEEKOFYEAR()` with `DAYOFWEEK()` to get even more detailed information about the date.  It returns the order date, the week number it falls into, and the day of the week for all orders placed in week 44 of 2024.

## Important Considerations

* **`mode` Argument (Or Lack Thereof):** Remember that `WEEKOFYEAR()` implicitly uses `mode 3` (ISO 8601). If you need a different week numbering scheme, you must use the `WEEK()` function with the appropriate `mode` argument.  This is a key distinction.
* **Year Boundaries:** Be aware of how `WEEKOFYEAR()` handles year boundaries.  The last week of the year might fall into the next year, and vice versa, due to the ISO 8601 standard.
* **Time Zones:** The `WEEKOFYEAR()` function is affected by the time zone setting of your MySQL server. Ensure that your server's time zone is configured correctly to avoid incorrect results.

## Alternatives and Further Reading

While `WEEKOFYEAR()` is excellent for ISO 8601 week numbering, consider these alternatives if you need different behavior:

* **`WEEK(date, mode)`:** This function allows you to specify the `mode`, giving you more control over the week numbering system.  Pay close attention to the `mode` values to ensure accurate results.
* **`EXTRACT(WEEK FROM date)`:** This is another option, also using ISO 8601 week numbering.

## Conclusion

The `WEEKOFYEAR()` function is a valuable tool for working with week numbers in MySQL. By understanding its syntax, usage, and limitations (particularly its implicit ISO 8601 numbering), you can effectively use it for various data analysis and reporting tasks. Remember to consider year boundaries and time zone settings to ensure accurate results.  And always be aware that if you need a different week numbering scheme, you'll need to use `WEEK(date, mode)` instead.
