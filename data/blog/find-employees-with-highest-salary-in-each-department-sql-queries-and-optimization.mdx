# Find Employees with Highest Salary in Each Department: SQL Queries & Optimization

Analyzing employee data is a common task for businesses. One particularly useful analysis is identifying the highest-paid employee within each department. This can help with salary benchmarking, identifying top performers, and making informed compensation decisions. This blog post will explore different SQL techniques to achieve this, covering various database systems and optimization strategies.

## The Challenge: Identifying Top Earners by Department

The core challenge lies in grouping employees by department and then, within each group, finding the employee(s) with the maximum salary. Straightforward aggregate functions like `MAX()` only provide the highest salary value, not the corresponding employee details. Therefore, we need more sophisticated techniques.

## Sample Data

Let's assume we have an `employees` table with the following structure and sample data:

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_name VARCHAR(255),
  department_id INT,
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
  department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  department_name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice Smith', 101, 60000.00),
(2, 'Bob Johnson', 101, 75000.00),
(3, 'Charlie Brown', 102, 55000.00),
(4, 'David Lee', 102, 65000.00),
(5, 'Eve Williams', 103, 80000.00),
(6, 'Frank Miller', 103, 80000.00),
(7, 'Grace Davis', 101, 75000.00);

INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(101, 'Sales'),
(102, 'Marketing'),
(103, 'Engineering');
```

Our goal is to retrieve the name, department, and salary of the employee(s) earning the highest salary in each department. Notice that in Engineering, Eve and Frank both have the same highest salary.

## Solutions

We'll explore several approaches, highlighting their pros and cons and performance considerations.

### 1. Using Window Functions (RANK() or DENSE_RANK())

Window functions are a powerful feature in modern SQL databases, offering an elegant and often efficient solution. `RANK()` assigns a rank to each row within a partition (department in our case) based on the salary. `DENSE_RANK()` is similar but assigns consecutive ranks without gaps even when there are ties in salary. We'll use `DENSE_RANK()` here to show _all_ employees sharing the highest salary.

```plaintext
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    d.department_name,
    e.salary
FROM (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        department_id,
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM employees
) AS ranked_employees
JOIN departments d ON ranked_employees.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN employees e ON ranked_employees.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE salary_rank = 1;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner Query (Ranking):** The inner query calculates the `DENSE_RANK()` of each employee within their respective department based on their salary in descending order. The `PARTITION BY department_id` clause groups the employees by department. `ORDER BY salary DESC` ensures the highest salary gets rank 1.
2. **Outer Query (Filtering):** The outer query filters the results to include only those employees whose `salary_rank` is 1. We also join the `departments` table to show the department name.

**Advantages:**

- **Concise and Readable:** Window functions often lead to more readable and maintainable SQL code.
- **Potentially Efficient:** Most modern database systems are well-optimized for window functions.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Database Support:** Window functions are not supported by all database systems, particularly older versions.

### 2. Using Subqueries with `IN` and `MAX()`

This approach uses a subquery to find the maximum salary for each department and then selects employees whose salary matches the department's maximum.

```plaintext
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    d.department_name,
    e.salary
FROM
    employees e
JOIN
    departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE
    (e.department_id, e.salary) IN (
        SELECT
            department_id,
            MAX(salary)
        FROM
            employees
        GROUP BY
            department_id
    );
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Subquery:** The subquery `SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id` calculates the maximum salary for each department.
2. **Outer Query:** The outer query selects employee details where the combination of `department_id` and `salary` matches a combination returned by the subquery.

**Advantages:**

- **Good Database Support:** This approach generally works across a wider range of database systems.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Performance Considerations:** The `IN` operator with a subquery can sometimes lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets. The database might need to execute the subquery multiple times.
- **Less Readable:** Can be harder to understand than the window function approach.

### 3. Using Correlated Subqueries

A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. In this case, we use it to check for each employee whether their salary is the maximum within their department.

```plaintext
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    d.department_name,
    e.salary
FROM
    employees e
JOIN
    departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE
    e.salary = (
        SELECT
            MAX(salary)
        FROM
            employees e2
        WHERE
            e2.department_id = e.department_id
    );
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Correlated Subquery:** The subquery `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id` calculates the maximum salary for the employee's department (from the outer query). It's correlated because `e.department_id` from the outer query is used in the `WHERE` clause of the subquery.
2. **Outer Query:** The outer query selects employee details where the employee's salary matches the maximum salary calculated by the correlated subquery.

**Advantages:**

- **Good Database Support:** Similar to the `IN` subquery approach, it's compatible with many database systems.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Performance Considerations:** Correlated subqueries are often the least performant solution, as the subquery is typically executed for each row in the outer query. This can lead to N+1 query issues (executing one query to fetch records and then N queries to fetch related data).

### 4. Using `NOT EXISTS`

This approach identifies the highest earners by checking if there exists any other employee within the same department with a higher salary.

```plaintext
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    d.department_name,
    e.salary
FROM
    employees e
JOIN
    departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id
    AND e2.salary > e.salary
);
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`NOT EXISTS` Subquery:** The subquery checks if there exists another employee (`e2`) in the same department (`e2.department_id = e.department_id`) with a higher salary (`e2.salary > e.salary`).
2. **Outer Query:** The outer query selects employees where the `NOT EXISTS` subquery returns true (meaning no other employee in the same department has a higher salary).

**Advantages:**

- **Clear Logic:** The logic is often easier to understand: "Select employees for whom there is no employee in the same department with a higher salary".

**Disadvantages:**

- **Performance Considerations:** Similar to correlated subqueries, the `NOT EXISTS` subquery can potentially be executed for each row, impacting performance, especially on large tables. However, some database optimizers can handle `NOT EXISTS` more efficiently than correlated subqueries.

## Performance Considerations and Optimization

The best approach from a performance perspective depends heavily on:

- **Database System:** Different databases have different query optimizers.
- **Data Volume:** The size of your `employees` table significantly impacts performance.
- **Indexing:** Proper indexing can drastically improve query performance.

Here are some general tips for optimization:

- **Indexing:** Create an index on `employees(department_id, salary DESC)` to speed up queries that involve filtering and sorting by department and salary. This is particularly important for window functions, subqueries with `IN`, and correlated subqueries.
- **Query Optimizer:** Understand how your database's query optimizer works. Use `EXPLAIN PLAN` (or its equivalent in your database system) to analyze the execution plan of each query and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Data Volume:** For very large datasets, consider partitioning the `employees` table by `department_id`.
- **Materialized Views:** For frequently executed queries, creating a materialized view (a pre-computed result set) can significantly improve performance. However, materialized views need to be refreshed periodically, adding some complexity.

## Choosing the Right Approach

- **Window Functions (RANK() or DENSE_RANK()):** Generally the preferred approach if your database supports them and you're using a modern version. Offers good readability and potentially excellent performance.
- **Subqueries with `IN`:** A reasonable alternative if window functions are not available. Pay attention to performance, especially with large datasets, and consider indexing.
- **Correlated Subqueries:** Generally the least performant option and should be avoided if possible.
- **`NOT EXISTS`:** Can be a readable alternative, but test its performance relative to other options.

**Recommendation:**

Start with window functions if available. If not, test the `IN` subquery and `NOT EXISTS` approaches, carefully analyzing their performance with your specific data and database system. Pay close attention to indexing and use your database's query analyzer to identify and address any bottlenecks.

By understanding these different SQL techniques and their performance implications, you can efficiently retrieve the employees with the highest salaries in each department and gain valuable insights into your organization's compensation structure.
