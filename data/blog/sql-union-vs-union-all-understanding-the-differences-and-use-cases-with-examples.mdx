# SQL UNION vs UNION ALL: A Comprehensive Guide

In the world of databases, combining data from multiple tables is a common task. SQL provides two powerful operators, `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, that allow you to merge the results of multiple `SELECT` statements into a single result set. While they seem similar at first glance, there are crucial differences that impact performance and the final output.  This blog post will delve deep into understanding `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, explaining their behavior, illustrating their use cases with practical examples, and highlighting performance considerations.

## What is `UNION` in SQL?

The `UNION` operator combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements, eliminating duplicate rows from the final result set. It ensures that each row in the output is unique. To use `UNION` effectively, there are a few important rules to keep in mind:

*   **Number of Columns:** The `SELECT` statements must have the same number of columns.
*   **Data Types:** The corresponding columns in each `SELECT` statement must have compatible data types.  Implicit data type conversion is allowed in some cases, but it's best to ensure data types are directly comparable.
*   **Column Order:**  The order of the columns in the `SELECT` statements must be consistent.  The column names from the first `SELECT` statement are used as the column names for the final result set.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
WHERE condition2;
```

**Example:**

Let's say we have two tables, `CustomersUSA` and `CustomersCanada`, both containing customer information.

```sql
-- Create the CustomersUSA table
CREATE TABLE CustomersUSA (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(255),
    LastName VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Insert sample data into CustomersUSA
INSERT INTO CustomersUSA (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, City) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'New York'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'Los Angeles'),
(3, 'Peter', 'Jones', 'Chicago');

-- Create the CustomersCanada table
CREATE TABLE CustomersCanada (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(255),
    LastName VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Insert sample data into CustomersCanada
INSERT INTO CustomersCanada (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, City) VALUES
(4, 'Alice', 'Brown', 'Toronto'),
(5, 'Bob', 'Wilson', 'Montreal'),
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'New York'); -- Duplicate CustomerID
```

Now, let's use `UNION` to retrieve a list of all customers from both tables:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM CustomersUSA
UNION
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM CustomersCanada;
```

**Result:**

| FirstName | LastName | City        |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| John      | Doe      | New York    |
| Jane      | Smith    | Los Angeles |
| Peter     | Jones    | Chicago     |
| Alice     | Brown    | Toronto     |
| Bob       | Wilson   | Montreal    |

Notice that even though `CustomersCanada` also contains a customer with `CustomerID` 1 (John Doe from New York), the `UNION` operator removed the duplicate row.

## What is `UNION ALL` in SQL?

The `UNION ALL` operator, unlike `UNION`, combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements *without* removing duplicate rows. It simply appends the result sets together.  This makes `UNION ALL` significantly faster than `UNION` when duplicate removal isn't necessary. The same rules regarding the number of columns, data types, and column order apply to `UNION ALL` as they do to `UNION`.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
WHERE condition2;
```

**Example:**

Using the same `CustomersUSA` and `CustomersCanada` tables from the previous example, let's use `UNION ALL` to retrieve all customers:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM CustomersUSA
UNION ALL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM CustomersCanada;
```

**Result:**

| FirstName | LastName | City        |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| John      | Doe      | New York    |
| Jane      | Smith    | Los Angeles |
| Peter     | Jones    | Chicago     |
| Alice     | Brown    | Toronto     |
| Bob       | Wilson   | Montreal    |
| John      | Doe      | New York    |   Duplicate row

As you can see, `UNION ALL` includes the duplicate "John Doe, New York" row from the `CustomersCanada` table.

## Key Differences: `UNION` vs. `UNION ALL`

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature           | `UNION`                                   | `UNION ALL`                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Duplicate Removal | Removes duplicate rows                      | Does not remove duplicate rows            |
| Performance       | Slower due to duplicate checking          | Faster as it simply appends the results    |
| Use Case          | When you need distinct rows only         | When you need all rows, including duplicates |

## When to Use Which?

*   **Use `UNION`:**
    *   When you need a unique list of values.
    *   When duplicates are not meaningful in your result set.
    *   When the performance difference is not critical.

*   **Use `UNION ALL`:**
    *   When you need all rows, including duplicates.
    *   When performance is critical, and you know duplicates are not an issue or are handled elsewhere in your application.
    *   When you specifically want to count the occurrences of each value, including duplicates, within the combined result set.

## Performance Considerations

The primary performance difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` stems from the duplicate removal process. `UNION` requires the database to sort and compare all rows from the combined result sets to identify and eliminate duplicates. This can be a resource-intensive operation, especially for large datasets.

`UNION ALL`, on the other hand, simply appends the results without performing any duplicate checking. This makes it significantly faster.

**Best Practices for Performance:**

1.  **Use `UNION ALL` when possible:**  If you don't need to remove duplicates, always opt for `UNION ALL`.
2.  **Optimize individual `SELECT` statements:**  Ensure that the individual `SELECT` statements are as efficient as possible. Use appropriate indexes and avoid unnecessary operations.
3.  **Consider indexing:** Indexes on the columns used in the `WHERE` clauses of the individual `SELECT` statements can significantly improve performance.
4.  **Analyze query execution plans:**  Use your database's query analyzer to understand how the `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operation is being executed and identify potential bottlenecks.

## Advanced Usage: Ordering and Filtering with `UNION` and `UNION ALL`

You can add `ORDER BY` and `WHERE` clauses to the individual `SELECT` statements within a `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operation. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

*   **`ORDER BY` within `SELECT` statements (generally):**  While many database systems allow `ORDER BY` clauses within individual `SELECT` statements that are part of a `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operation, the ordering is *not* guaranteed to be preserved in the final result set *unless* you specify an `ORDER BY` clause *outside* the entire `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operation. The specific behavior depends on the database system you're using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).  It's generally best practice to apply the final `ORDER BY` at the outermost level.

*   **`WHERE` clauses:** You can apply `WHERE` clauses to each individual `SELECT` statement to filter the data before it's combined.

**Example with Filtering and Ordering:**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM CustomersUSA
WHERE City = 'New York'
UNION ALL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City
FROM CustomersCanada
WHERE City = 'Toronto'
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;
```

This example first filters customers from the USA who live in New York and customers from Canada who live in Toronto. Then, it combines these results using `UNION ALL` (including duplicates) and finally orders the combined result set by `LastName` and then `FirstName`.

##  `UNION` and `UNION ALL` with Different Tables and Columns

While the examples above used similar tables, `UNION` and `UNION ALL` can also combine data from tables with different structures, as long as the number and data types of the selected columns are compatible.

**Example:**

Let's say we have an `Employees` table and a `Contractors` table.

```sql
-- Create Employees table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(255),
    LastName VARCHAR(255),
    JobTitle VARCHAR(255),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data into Employees
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, Salary) VALUES
(1, 'David', 'Lee', 'Software Engineer', 80000.00),
(2, 'Sarah', 'Chen', 'Data Scientist', 90000.00);

-- Create Contractors table
CREATE TABLE Contractors (
    ContractorID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(255),
    LastName VARCHAR(255),
    Specialty VARCHAR(255),
    HourlyRate DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data into Contractors
INSERT INTO Contractors (ContractorID, FirstName, LastName, Specialty, HourlyRate) VALUES
(1, 'Michael', 'Brown', 'Web Developer', 75.00),
(2, 'Emily', 'Davis', 'Database Admin', 80.00);
```

We can combine the first and last names from both tables to create a list of all personnel:

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Contractors;
```

The result will be a list of all first and last names from both tables, even though the original tables have different columns.  Keep in mind that since the column names are derived from the *first* `SELECT` statement in the `UNION ALL`, you'll only see `FirstName` and `LastName` as the column headers in the result.  You can use column aliases (e.g., `SELECT FirstName AS Name ...`) to provide more descriptive column names in the output.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

*   **Data Type Mismatches:** Ensure that the corresponding columns in each `SELECT` statement have compatible data types. Implicit conversions can sometimes mask errors, but it's best to be explicit.
*   **Incorrect Number of Columns:** Verify that each `SELECT` statement has the same number of columns.
*   **Forgetting `UNION ALL` when duplicates are acceptable:**  If you don't need to remove duplicates, using `UNION` unnecessarily will significantly impact performance.
*   **Assuming `ORDER BY` within individual `SELECT` statements will guarantee final order:** As mentioned before, the `ORDER BY` clause should usually be applied outside the entire `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operation for reliable ordering of the final result.

## Conclusion

`UNION` and `UNION ALL` are essential SQL operators for combining data from multiple tables. Understanding their differences and when to use each is crucial for writing efficient and accurate queries. By carefully considering performance implications and following best practices, you can effectively leverage these operators to solve a wide range of data manipulation tasks. Remember to choose `UNION ALL` when possible to optimize performance and only use `UNION` when you explicitly need to eliminate duplicate rows.
