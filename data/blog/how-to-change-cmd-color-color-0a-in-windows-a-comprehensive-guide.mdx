# How to Change CMD Color (Color 0A) in Windows: A Comprehensive Guide

The Windows Command Prompt (CMD) is a powerful tool for interacting directly with your operating system. However, its default black and white color scheme can be a bit drab and monotonous. Fortunately, changing the CMD color is a simple process that can significantly improve your experience and readability. This guide will walk you through various methods to change the CMD color, including using the `color` command, understanding color codes (like the famous `0A`), and making your color changes permanent.

## Why Customize Your CMD Color?

Customizing your CMD color scheme offers several benefits:

*   **Improved Readability:**  Certain color combinations can make text easier to read, reducing eye strain, especially during long sessions.
*   **Enhanced Productivity:** Distinguishing between different commands and outputs becomes easier with a personalized color scheme.
*   **Personalization:** Tailoring your CMD's appearance to your preferences makes it more enjoyable to use.
*   **Error Highlighting:** You can use distinct colors to highlight errors or warnings, making them immediately noticeable.

## Method 1: Using the `color` Command

The most straightforward way to change the CMD color is by using the built-in `color` command. This command takes a two-digit hexadecimal number as an argument, where the first digit represents the background color and the second digit represents the text color.

**Syntax:**

```batch
color XY
```

Where:

*   `X` is the hexadecimal digit for the background color.
*   `Y` is the hexadecimal digit for the text color.

**Color Codes:**

| Digit | Color        |
|-------|--------------|
| 0     | Black        |
| 1     | Blue         |
| 2     | Green        |
| 3     | Aqua         |
| 4     | Red          |
| 5     | Purple       |
| 6     | Yellow       |
| 7     | White        |
| 8     | Gray         |
| 9     | Light Blue   |
| A     | Light Green  |
| B     | Light Aqua   |
| C     | Light Red    |
| D     | Light Purple |
| E     | Light Yellow |
| F     | Bright White |

**Example: Color 0A (Black Background, Light Green Text)**

To achieve the classic "Color 0A" look (black background with light green text), simply type the following command in your CMD window and press Enter:

```batch
color 0A
```

This is a very popular combination and provides excellent contrast for easy readability.

**Other Examples:**

*   `color 07`:  Black background with White text (default)
*   `color 1F`:  Blue background with Bright White text
*   `color 4E`:  Red background with Light Yellow text
*   `color 2F`:  Green background with Bright White text

**Listing Available Colors:**

To see a list of all available color combinations, simply type `color /?` in your CMD window and press Enter. This will display a helpful table of color codes and their corresponding colors.

## Method 2: Changing the Color via Command Prompt Properties

Another way to customize the CMD color is through its properties. This allows for more granular control over the appearance, including adjusting screen background, text color, popup window appearance, and even transparency.

1.  **Open Command Prompt:**  Open the Command Prompt window.
2.  **Access Properties:** Right-click on the title bar of the Command Prompt window and select "Properties".
3.  **Navigate to the "Colors" Tab:** In the Properties window, click on the "Colors" tab.
4.  **Select Screen Background or Text Color:** Choose either "Screen Background" or "Text Color" from the "Select Screen Value" list.
5.  **Choose Your Color:** Select the desired color from the available color palette.  You can also adjust the Red, Green, and Blue values for even more precise color customization.
6.  **Apply Changes:** Click "OK" to apply the changes.

This method provides a visual way to experiment with different color combinations and find what works best for you.  You can also customize the colors for the popup window in the same tab.

## Making the Color Changes Permanent

The methods described above only change the color of the current CMD session. When you close the window, the changes are lost. To make the color changes permanent, you need to modify the default settings.

**Method 1: Modifying the Default Console Properties**

This method changes the *default* properties for all future Command Prompt windows.

1.  **Open Command Prompt:** Open the Command Prompt.
2.  **Access Properties:** Right-click on the title bar and select "Defaults".  *Crucially, select "Defaults" and not "Properties."*
3.  **Navigate to the "Colors" Tab:**  In the "Defaults" window, click on the "Colors" tab.
4.  **Select Screen Background or Text Color:**  Choose either "Screen Background" or "Text Color".
5.  **Choose Your Color:** Select the desired color.
6.  **Apply Changes:** Click "OK".  From now on, all new Command Prompt windows will use these settings.

**Method 2: Using the Registry (Advanced)**

This method is more technical and involves editing the Windows Registry.  **Be careful when editing the registry, as incorrect changes can cause system instability.** Always back up your registry before making any modifications.

1.  **Open Registry Editor:** Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter.
2.  **Navigate to the Console Key:** Navigate to the following registry key:

    `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console`

3.  **Modify the "ScreenColors" Value:** Look for the value named "ScreenColors" (for background and text colors) in the right pane. If it doesn't exist, you can create it as a REG_DWORD value.
4.  **Set the Value:** Double-click on "ScreenColors" to edit it.
    *   The value is a hexadecimal number representing the background and text colors. Use the same color codes as the `color` command.  For example, `0A` (black background, light green text) would be represented as `0000000A` in hexadecimal.
5.  **Modify the "PopupColors" Value:** You can also modify the `PopupColors` value in the same way to change the colors of popup windows.
6.  **Restart CMD:** Close and reopen the Command Prompt for the changes to take effect.

**Example: Setting ScreenColors to 0A in Registry**

In the Registry Editor, double-click on `ScreenColors`.  Select the "Decimal" radio button (easier for conversions).  Then, enter the decimal equivalent of hexadecimal `0000000A`, which is `10`.  Click OK.  Close and reopen the CMD window to see the change.

## Using Batch Scripts to Automate Color Changes

You can create batch scripts to quickly change the CMD color. This is especially useful if you want to switch between different color schemes frequently.

**Example Batch Script (color0a.bat):**

```batch
@echo off
color 0A
cls
echo Color scheme set to black background with light green text.
pause
```

**Explanation:**

*   `@echo off`: Disables the echoing of commands to the console.
*   `color 0A`: Sets the color to black background with light green text.
*   `cls`: Clears the screen.
*   `echo Color scheme set to black background with light green text.`: Displays a message to the user.
*   `pause`: Pauses the script until the user presses a key.

To use this script, save it as `color0a.bat` (or any name you prefer) and double-click it to run.  The CMD window will open, change the color, display the message, and wait for you to press a key before closing.

**Creating a Script for Resetting to Default Colors:**

You can create a similar script to reset the color scheme to the default black background and white text:

```batch
@echo off
color 07
cls
echo Color scheme reset to default (black background with white text).
pause
```

## PowerShell vs. CMD Color Customization

While this guide focuses primarily on CMD, it's worth noting that PowerShell offers more advanced color customization options.

**PowerShell's `Set-ConsoleColor` Cmdlet:**

PowerShell provides the `Set-ConsoleColor` cmdlet, which allows you to set the foreground and background colors more directly.

```powershell
Set-ConsoleColor -ForegroundColor Green -BackgroundColor Black
```

This is functionally equivalent to `color 0A` in CMD, but the PowerShell syntax is more readable.

**PowerShell Profiles:**

PowerShell also allows you to create profiles that automatically execute scripts when PowerShell starts. This is a great way to permanently customize your PowerShell environment, including setting the color scheme.  The profile file is typically located at `$PROFILE`.

## Conclusion

Changing the CMD color is a simple yet effective way to improve your command-line experience.  Whether you prefer the classic "Color 0A" or a more customized scheme, the methods outlined in this guide will help you personalize your Windows Command Prompt. Remember to consider readability and your personal preferences when choosing a color scheme. By using the `color` command, modifying CMD properties, or even creating batch scripts, you can easily tailor the appearance of your command-line environment to suit your needs.  Happy coding!
