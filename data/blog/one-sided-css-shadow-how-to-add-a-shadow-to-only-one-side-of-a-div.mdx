# One-Sided CSS Shadow: How to Add a Shadow to Only One Side of a Div

Creating shadows with CSS can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your web applications. While `box-shadow` is a powerful tool for adding shadows all around an element, sometimes you might want a more subtle effect: a shadow that appears on only one side. This post will guide you through various techniques to achieve precisely that.

## Understanding the `box-shadow` Property

Before diving into one-sided shadows, let's quickly recap the `box-shadow` property. It accepts the following values:

```plaintext
box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;
```

- **`h-offset` (horizontal offset):** A positive value moves the shadow to the right; a negative value moves it to the left.
- **`v-offset` (vertical offset):** A positive value moves the shadow downward; a negative value moves it upward.
- **`blur`:** The amount of blur applied to the shadow. A higher value creates a more diffused shadow.
- **`spread`:** The amount the shadow extends beyond the box. A positive value expands the shadow; a negative value shrinks it.
- **`color`:** The color of the shadow.
- **`inset`:** If present, the shadow is drawn _inside_ the box.

Understanding how these values interact is crucial for creating the desired one-sided shadow effect.

## Method 1: Using `box-shadow` with Zero Offset and Blur

This is the most straightforward method for creating a sharp, one-sided shadow. The trick is to set the offset for the other direction to zero and use a small blur.

**Example: Creating a shadow on the right side:**

```plaintext
.shadow-right {
  box-shadow: 5px 0px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

In this example:

- `5px`: The shadow is offset 5 pixels to the right.
- `0px`: No vertical offset.
- `0px`: No blur applied. This creates a sharp edge.
- `0px`: No spread.
- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)`: A semi-transparent black shadow.

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<div class="shadow-right">This div has a shadow on the right.</div>
```

**Live Demo:**

(You'd typically embed a CodeSandbox or similar here to show the code running live)

**Variations:**

- **Shadow on the left:** `box-shadow: -5px 0px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);`
- **Shadow on the top:** `box-shadow: 0px -5px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);`
- **Shadow on the bottom:** `box-shadow: 0px 5px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);`

This method is great for creating a subtle highlight or dividing line effect.

## Method 2: Using `box-shadow` with Blur and Negative Spread

This method involves using a blur and then a negative spread to control the shadow's reach. This is useful for creating a softer, more diffused one-sided shadow.

**Example: Creating a shadow on the bottom:**

```plaintext
.shadow-bottom {
  box-shadow: 0px 5px 5px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

In this example:

- `0px`: No horizontal offset.
- `5px`: The shadow is offset 5 pixels downward.
- `5px`: A 5-pixel blur is applied.
- `-3px`: The shadow is contracted by 3 pixels. This ensures that the shadow only appears on the bottom.
- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)`: A semi-transparent black shadow.

The negative spread value is key. It essentially pulls the shadow back in, preventing it from wrapping around the other sides of the element. Experiment with the blur and spread values to get the desired effect.

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<div class="shadow-bottom">This div has a soft shadow on the bottom.</div>
```

**Live Demo:**

(Again, embed a CodeSandbox or similar)

**Variations:**

Adjust the horizontal/vertical offset and change the signs of the values for shadows on different sides.

## Method 3: Using Pseudo-elements

This method offers more flexibility, but also requires a bit more code. We'll create a pseudo-element (e.g., `::after`) and position it to act as our shadow. This gives us fine-grained control over its appearance.

**Example: Creating a shadow on the left:**

```plaintext
.shadow-left-pseudo {
  position: relative; /* Important: Establish positioning context */
  overflow: hidden; /* Important: Ensure the shadow doesn't overflow the container */
}

.shadow-left-pseudo::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0; /* Place shadow on the left */
  width: 5px; /* Shadow width */
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), transparent); /* Create a gradient for a smooth fade */
  z-index: -1; /* Place shadow behind the content */
}
```

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<div class="shadow-left-pseudo">This div has a pseudo-element shadow on the left.</div>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`position: relative;` on the parent:** This is crucial. It establishes a positioning context for the pseudo-element.
2.  **`position: absolute;` on the pseudo-element:** Allows us to position the pseudo-element precisely within the parent.
3.  **`overflow:hidden;` on the parent**: prevents the shadow from overflowing the div on the sides.
4.  **`content: '';`:** All pseudo-elements need a `content` property.
5.  **`top: 0; left: 0;`:** Positions the pseudo-element at the top-left corner of the parent.
6.  **`width: 5px; height: 100%;`:** Sets the dimensions of the shadow. The height is 100% of the parent.
7.  **`background: linear-gradient(...)`:** Creates a gradient effect for the shadow, fading from opaque to transparent. This provides a smoother, more realistic look.
8.  **`z-index: -1;`:** Places the shadow _behind_ the content of the div, so it doesn't obscure the text.

**Live Demo:**

(Embed CodeSandbox or similar)

**Advantages of this method:**

- **Greater Control:** You can use gradients, multiple backgrounds, or even images for the shadow.
- **More Complex Effects:** Easily create shadows with custom shapes or textures.

**Variations:**

Adjust the `left`, `top`, `width`, `height`, and `background` properties to create shadows on different sides. For example, to create a shadow on the bottom:

```plaintext
.shadow-bottom-pseudo::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 5px;
  background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), transparent);
  z-index: -1;
}
```

## Method 4: Using `outline` with `outline-offset`

This method is more of a hack, but in some simple cases, it can suffice. It uses the `outline` property and offsets it to create a shadow-like effect.

**Example: Creating a shadow on the bottom:**

```plaintext
.shadow-bottom-outline {
  outline: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  outline-offset: 5px; /* Adjust this value to control the shadow distance */
}
```

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<div class="shadow-bottom-outline">This div has an outline shadow on the bottom.</div>
```

**Limitations:**

- Doesn't support blur or spread.
- `outline` doesn't always work well with rounded corners.
- Not suitable for complex shadows.

However, for simple, quick shadows, it can be a viable option.

## Browser Compatibility

All methods discussed are widely supported across modern browsers. `box-shadow` has excellent compatibility, and pseudo-elements have been around for a long time. `outline` also has good support. Always test your code in different browsers to ensure consistent results.

## Conclusion

Adding one-sided shadows to your web elements can significantly improve their visual appeal and create a more engaging user experience. Choose the method that best suits your needs based on the desired effect and the complexity of your design. Remember to experiment with different values to achieve the perfect shadow for your project. This tutorial has provided you with several techniques; now, go forth and add some single-sided shadows!
