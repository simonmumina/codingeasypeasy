# Secure Your Nuxt App with Auth.js (NextAuth): A Comprehensive Guide

Authentication is a crucial aspect of modern web applications. It ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources and functionalities. While numerous authentication solutions exist, Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js) stands out as a flexible and powerful option, especially for applications built with frameworks like Next.js and, as we'll explore here, Nuxt.js.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of integrating Auth.js into your Nuxt 3 application, covering everything from initial setup to advanced configuration. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to implement secure authentication and user management in your Nuxt project.

## Why Choose Auth.js for Your Nuxt App?

Auth.js offers several compelling advantages for Nuxt developers:

- **Simplified Authentication:** Auth.js abstracts away much of the complexity involved in implementing authentication, allowing you to focus on building your application's core features.
- **Multiple Providers:** It supports a wide range of authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, GitHub, and many more, as well as passwordless authentication.
- **Secure Session Management:** Auth.js provides robust session management, ensuring that user sessions are securely stored and managed.
- **Flexibility and Customization:** You can customize Auth.js to fit your specific needs, including handling custom database integrations and tailoring the user experience.
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering) Compatibility:** Crucially for Nuxt, Auth.js is designed to work well with SSR frameworks, making it suitable for building SEO-friendly and performant applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed:** You'll need Node.js to run your Nuxt application and a package manager to install dependencies.
- **A Nuxt 3 Project:** This guide assumes you have a basic Nuxt 3 project set up. If not, you can create one using `npx nuxi init my-nuxt-app`.
- **A Database (Optional):** If you plan to store user data in a database, you'll need to have one set up. Auth.js supports various databases, including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. For this guide, we will focus on using the built-in authentication through providers, but keep database integration in mind for more complex applications.
- **Environment Variables:** You'll need to set up environment variables to store sensitive information such as your authentication provider's client ID and secret.

## Step 1: Install the Required Packages

First, install the necessary packages using npm, yarn, or pnpm. We'll install `@auth/core` and `@sidebase/nuxt-auth`. The `@auth/core` package contains the core logic for Auth.js, while `@sidebase/nuxt-auth` provides seamless integration with Nuxt 3's module system.

```plaintext
npm install @auth/core @sidebase/nuxt-auth
# or
yarn add @auth/core @sidebase/nuxt-auth
# or
pnpm add @auth/core @sidebase/nuxt-auth
```

## Step 2: Configure the Nuxt Auth Module

Next, you need to configure the `@sidebase/nuxt-auth` module in your `nuxt.config.ts` file. This involves adding the module to the `modules` array and setting up the necessary options.

```plaintext
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    isEnabled: true, // Enable the module
    globalAppMiddleware: true, // Optional: Protect every page by default
    provider: {
      type: 'authjs',
    },
    // Add any additional configuration options here
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth']`: This adds the `@sidebase/nuxt-auth` module to your Nuxt application.
- `isEnabled: true`: Enables the Auth.js integration. If you need to temporarily disable authentication, you can set this to `false`.
- `globalAppMiddleware: true`: When set to `true`, all routes will be protected by default. You can then selectively disable authentication for specific routes using the `definePageMeta` composable (more on this later). If set to false, routes will be unprotected by default, requiring manual protection with `definePageMeta` for each route you want protected.
- `provider: { type: 'authjs' }`: Specifies the authentication provider type. In this case, we're using `authjs` to leverage the Auth.js ecosystem of providers.

## Step 3: Create the Auth.js API Route

Auth.js requires an API route to handle authentication requests. Create a new file at `server/api/auth/[...].ts` (the `[...]` is crucial; it's a catch-all route) and add the following code:

```plaintext
// server/api/auth/[...].ts
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'
import GithubProvider from '@auth/core/providers/github'
import GoogleProvider from '@auth/core/providers/google'

const runtimeConfig = useRuntimeConfig()

export default NuxtAuthHandler({
  secret: runtimeConfig.auth.secret, // Required secret
  providers: [
    // @ts-expect-error You need to use .default when importing directly from node modules.
    GithubProvider.default({
      clientId: runtimeConfig.github.clientId,
      clientSecret: runtimeConfig.github.clientSecret,
    }),
    // @ts-expect-error You need to use .default when importing directly from node modules.
    GoogleProvider.default({
      clientId: runtimeConfig.google.clientId,
      clientSecret: runtimeConfig.google.clientSecret,
    }),
  ],
  callbacks: {
    async session({ session, token }) {
      // You can add custom properties to the session object here.
      session.user.id = token.sub // Example: Add the user's ID to the session
      return session
    },
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `import { NuxtAuthHandler } from '#auth'`: Imports the Auth.js handler specifically designed for Nuxt.
- `import GithubProvider from "@auth/core/providers/github"` and `import GoogleProvider from "@auth/core/providers/google"`: Imports the authentication providers you want to use. Replace these with the providers you prefer.
- `const runtimeConfig = useRuntimeConfig()`: Accesses the Nuxt runtime configuration, allowing you to retrieve environment variables.
- `secret: runtimeConfig.auth.secret`: The `secret` option is crucial for security. It's used to encrypt the session cookie. You should generate a strong, random string and store it in your environment variables. We'll define these shortly.
- `providers`: An array of authentication providers. Each provider requires a `clientId` and `clientSecret`, which you obtain from the respective provider's developer console.
- `callbacks`: This allows you to customize the authentication flow. The `session` callback is particularly useful for adding custom properties to the session object, such as the user's ID or roles. The token object contains the decoded JWT, with the `sub` field usually representing the user ID. The `@ts-expect-error` are needed for the providers due to a known issue in the way they are packaged. It is a temporary workaround.

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

You need to set up environment variables to store your authentication secrets and provider credentials. Create a `.env` file (or `.env.local` for local development) in the root of your project and add the following:

```
AUTH_SECRET=YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING  # Generate a strong, random string
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

**Important:**

- Replace `YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING` with a strong, random string. You can generate one using a tool like `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, and `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` with the actual credentials you obtain from the respective provider's developer console.
- **Never commit your `.env` file to your Git repository.** Add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of your secrets.

## Step 5: Update `nuxt.config.ts` for runtime config

You need to make the environment variables available to the `NuxtAuthHandler` by adding them to the `runtimeConfig` object in your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```plaintext
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    isEnabled: true, // Enable the module
    globalAppMiddleware: true, // Optional: Protect every page by default
    provider: {
      type: 'authjs',
    },
    // Add any additional configuration options here
  },
  runtimeConfig: {
    auth: {
      secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
    },
    github: {
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
    google: {
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
    public: {
      //  Add any public variables here that can be exposed to the client side
    },
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We're adding a `runtimeConfig` object with nested `auth`, `github`, and `google` objects.
- Each of these objects contains the corresponding environment variables.
- `process.env.YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` is used to access the environment variables set in your `.env` file.

## Step 6: Implement Sign-in and Sign-out Functionality

Now, let's create some components to handle sign-in and sign-out functionality. Create a new component, for example `components/AuthButtons.vue`:

```plaintext
// components/AuthButtons.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <button v-if="!authState.status || authState.status === 'unauthenticated'" @click="signIn('github')">Sign in with GitHub</button>
    <button v-if="!authState.status || authState.status === 'unauthenticated'" @click="signIn('google')">Sign in with Google</button>
    <button v-if="authState.status === 'authenticated'" @click="signOut">Sign out</button>
    <p v-if="authState.status === 'authenticated'">Logged in as {{ authState.data?.user?.email }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useAuth } from "@sidebase/nuxt-auth/composables";

const { signIn, signOut, status, data } = useAuth()

const authState = useAuth()
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- `useAuth()`: This composable from `@sidebase/nuxt-auth` provides access to the authentication state and functions.
- `signIn('github')` and `signIn('google')`: These functions initiate the sign-in flow with the specified provider. The provider name should match the name you used in the `providers` array in your `server/api/auth/[...].ts` file.
- `signOut()`: This function signs the user out.
- `authState.data?.user?.email`: This accesses the user's email address from the session data. You can access other user properties as well, depending on the provider and your configuration.
- Conditional rendering based on `authState.status`: The buttons and the "Logged in as" paragraph change according to the current authentication status.

## Step 7: Use the Auth Buttons in Your Pages

Now you can include the `AuthButtons` component in your pages. For example, in `pages/index.vue`:

```plaintext
// pages/index.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to My Nuxt App</h1>
    <AuthButtons />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import AuthButtons from '../components/AuthButtons.vue';
</script>
```

## Step 8: Protect Routes (Optional)

If you enabled `globalAppMiddleware: true` in your `nuxt.config.ts` file, all routes are protected by default. To make a route public, you can use `definePageMeta`:

```plaintext
// pages/public-page.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>This is a public page</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  auth: false // Disable authentication for this page
})
</script>
```

If you did _not_ enable `globalAppMiddleware: true` in your `nuxt.config.ts` file, all routes are public by default. To protect a route, you can use `definePageMeta`:

```plaintext
// pages/protected-page.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>This is a protected page</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
definePageMeta({
  auth: true // Enable authentication for this page
})
</script>
```

## Step 9: Accessing Session Data

You can access the session data in any component using the `useAuth` composable:

```plaintext
// components/Profile.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>User ID: {{ authState.data?.user?.id }}</p>
    <p>User Email: {{ authState.data?.user?.email }}</p>
    <!-- Display other user data here -->
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useAuth } from "@sidebase/nuxt-auth/composables";

const authState = useAuth();
</script>
```
