# Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR): A Complete Guide with Code Examples

Next.js is a powerful React framework that offers several rendering strategies to optimize your web application for performance, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and user experience. Among these strategies, **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** stands out as a crucial technique for delivering content that's readily accessible to search engine crawlers and provides a faster initial load for users.

This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of SSR in Next.js, covering its benefits, implementation details, and best practices. We'll walk through concrete examples and practical code snippets to illustrate how to leverage `getServerSideProps` effectively.

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

In traditional client-side rendered React applications, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and then executes JavaScript code to fetch data and render the actual content. While this approach allows for highly interactive user interfaces, it can lead to challenges:

- **Poor SEO:** Search engine crawlers may struggle to index content that's rendered dynamically by JavaScript.
- **Slow Initial Load Times:** Users experience a blank screen until the JavaScript is downloaded, parsed, and executed.
- **Accessibility Issues:** Screen readers might have difficulty interpreting content rendered after the initial page load.

SSR addresses these issues by rendering the application's initial HTML on the server before sending it to the client. The browser receives a fully rendered HTML page, allowing search engines to easily crawl and index the content, and users to see meaningful content faster. The React code then hydrates the HTML, making it interactive.

## Benefits of Server-Side Rendering

- **Improved SEO:** Search engine crawlers can easily access and index content. This is arguably the biggest benefit.
- **Faster Initial Load Times:** Users see content immediately, improving the perceived performance and user experience. This is crucial for reducing bounce rates.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Screen readers can access content without waiting for JavaScript to execute.
- **Better Social Sharing:** Social media crawlers can properly extract metadata and previews from SSR pages.

## Implementing Server-Side Rendering in Next.js using `getServerSideProps`

Next.js simplifies SSR through the `getServerSideProps` function. This asynchronous function is executed on the server for each request, allowing you to fetch data and pass it as props to your page component. It runs _only_ on the server and never on the client, guaranteeing data security.

Here's a basic example:

```plaintext
// pages/index.js
import React from 'react';

function HomePage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Data</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // Fetch data from an API or database
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'); // Example API endpoint
  const data = await res.json();

  // Pass data to the page via props
  return {
    props: { data },
  };
}

export default HomePage;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`getServerSideProps(context)`:** This function is defined and exported from your page component (`pages/index.js` in this case). It takes a `context` object as an argument, which provides access to information about the request.
2.  **Fetching Data:** Inside `getServerSideProps`, you fetch data from an API or database using `fetch`, `axios`, or any other data-fetching library. This happens on the server.
3.  **Returning Props:** The function returns an object with a `props` key. The value of `props` is an object containing the data you want to pass to your page component.
4.  **Using the Props:** The page component receives the data as props, which can then be used to render the content.

**Important Notes:**

- `getServerSideProps` can _only_ be exported from a **page**. It cannot be used within regular React components.
- You cannot use `useEffect` or other client-side lifecycle methods inside `getServerSideProps` as it executes _solely_ on the server.
- The `context` object passed to `getServerSideProps` contains the following properties:
  - `req`: The HTTP request object.
  - `res`: The HTTP response object.
  - `params`: The route parameters.
  - `query`: The query string parameters.
  - `resolvedUrl`: The URL after resolving rewrites and redirects.
  - `locale`: The active locale (if internationalized routing is enabled).
  - `locales`: All supported locales (if internationalized routing is enabled).
  - `defaultLocale`: The default locale (if internationalized routing is enabled).
  - `preview`: If the page is in Preview Mode (boolean).
  - `previewData`: The data that was set during Preview Mode (object).

## Error Handling in `getServerSideProps`

Proper error handling is essential to prevent your application from crashing or displaying unexpected behavior. You can handle errors within `getServerSideProps` using `try...catch` blocks.

```plaintext
// pages/error-example.js
import React from 'react';

function ErrorExamplePage({ data, error }) {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Error</h1>
        <p>{error.message}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/this-endpoint-does-not-exist');
    if (!res.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch data: ${res.status}`);
    }
    const data = await res.json();

    return {
      props: { data },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    return {
      props: { error: { message: error.message } },
    };
  }
}

export default ErrorExamplePage;
```

In this example, if the `fetch` request fails, an error is caught, and an error message is passed as a prop to the page component. The component then renders an error message instead of attempting to display the data.

## Redirects in `getServerSideProps`

You can also implement redirects directly within `getServerSideProps` using the `redirect` key in the return object. This is useful for scenarios like authentication or conditional navigation.

```plaintext
// pages/redirect-example.js
import React from 'react';

function RedirectExamplePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This page will redirect.</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // Perform some checks or conditions here
  const isAuthenticated = false; // Example: User is not authenticated

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/login', // Redirect to the login page
        permanent: false, // Use `true` for permanent redirects (301)
      },
    };
  }

  // If authenticated, return props (even if empty)
  return {
    props: {},
  };
}

export default RedirectExamplePage;
```

**Explanation:**

- The `redirect` object specifies the destination URL and whether the redirect is permanent (301) or temporary (302).
- The `permanent` property should be set to `true` only when the resource has permanently moved to a new location.

## When to Use Server-Side Rendering

SSR is most beneficial in the following situations:

- **SEO is critical:** When you need search engines to index your content effectively. This includes blogs, e-commerce sites, and other content-heavy applications.
- **Fast initial load times are important:** When you want to provide users with a quick and responsive experience.
- **You need to access server-side resources:** When your application requires access to databases or other server-side resources that should not be exposed to the client.
- **Social sharing is essential:** To ensure correct previews and metadata for social media platforms.

## Alternatives to Server-Side Rendering

Next.js offers other rendering strategies that may be more suitable depending on your specific needs:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Generate HTML at build time. Ideal for content that doesn't change frequently, like blog posts or documentation. Use `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** Render content entirely in the browser. Suitable for highly interactive applications where SEO is less of a concern.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Generate static pages at build time and then regenerate them in the background on a schedule or on-demand. Provides a balance between SSG and SSR. Use `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.

## Best Practices for Server-Side Rendering in Next.js

- **Optimize Data Fetching:** Minimize the amount of data fetched in `getServerSideProps` to reduce server response times. Consider using caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected application crashes.
- **Avoid Complex Logic:** Keep the logic within `getServerSideProps` as simple as possible to improve performance. Delegate complex calculations or data processing to separate functions or services.
- **Consider Caching:** While `getServerSideProps` fetches data on every request, consider implementing server-side caching strategies (e.g., using Redis or Memcached) to improve performance for frequently accessed pages. Be mindful of cache invalidation strategies.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials in environment variables.
- **Monitor Performance:** Track the performance of your SSR pages and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Understand the Tradeoffs:** SSR adds complexity and server load. Evaluate whether the benefits outweigh the costs for your specific application. Consider the other rendering strategies available in Next.js.
- **Clean Up Context:** When dealing with resources in the `context` (such as closing database connections), make sure to clean them up after you're done to prevent memory leaks.

## Conclusion

Server-Side Rendering is a powerful technique for enhancing the SEO, performance, and accessibility of your Next.js applications. By leveraging the `getServerSideProps` function, you can seamlessly fetch data on the server and render fully formed HTML pages that are readily indexable by search engines and provide a faster initial load for your users. By understanding its benefits, implementation details, and best practices, you can create robust and performant web experiences with Next.js. Remember to carefully evaluate whether SSR is the right choice for your specific application and to explore other rendering strategies offered by Next.js when appropriate.
