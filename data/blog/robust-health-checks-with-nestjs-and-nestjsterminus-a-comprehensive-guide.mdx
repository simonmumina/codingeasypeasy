# Robust Health Checks with NestJS and @nestjs/terminus: A Comprehensive Guide

In the world of modern application development, ensuring the health and availability of your services is paramount. Regular health checks are crucial for proactive monitoring, automated recovery, and ensuring a smooth user experience. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on implementing health checks in your NestJS applications using the `@nestjs/terminus` module. We'll cover everything from installation and configuration to advanced use cases like checking database connections, external APIs, and more.

## What are Health Checks and Why are They Important?

Health checks are mechanisms to determine the current state of a service. They typically involve querying a specific endpoint that performs a series of tests to verify the service's dependencies and overall health. A successful health check indicates that the service is running correctly and can handle incoming requests. A failed health check signals a problem, allowing for automated responses like restarting the service, scaling up resources, or alerting operations teams.

Here's why health checks are so important:

- **Early Problem Detection:** They provide proactive warnings of potential issues before they impact users.
- **Automated Recovery:** Integrate with orchestration platforms (like Kubernetes) to automatically restart or redeploy unhealthy instances.
- **Improved Observability:** They provide insights into the internal state of your application, making it easier to debug and troubleshoot problems.
- **Reduced Downtime:** By enabling faster detection and remediation of issues, health checks help minimize downtime and improve overall service availability.
- **Simplified Monitoring:** Centralized health check endpoints provide a single point of truth for monitoring your application's health.

## Introducing `@nestjs/terminus`

`@nestjs/terminus` is a powerful NestJS module that simplifies the implementation of health checks. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for defining health indicators and integrating with various data sources and external services. It offers several built-in health indicators, and also makes it easy to create custom ones.

## Getting Started: Installation and Configuration

Let's dive into the practical aspects of implementing health checks using `@nestjs/terminus`.

**1. Installation:**

First, install the necessary packages using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install --save @nestjs/terminus @nestjs/platform-express reflect-metadata
# or
yarn add @nestjs/terminus @nestjs/platform-express reflect-metadata
```

- `@nestjs/terminus`: The core module providing the health check functionality.
- `@nestjs/platform-express`: Required if you're using the Express adapter (which is the default).
- `reflect-metadata`: Required for NestJS's dependency injection.

**2. Import and Configure the Module:**

Import the `TerminusModule` in your main application module (`app.module.ts`):

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { TerminusModule } from '@nestjs/terminus'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'

@Module({
  imports: [TerminusModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**3. Create a Health Controller:**

Create a controller to handle the health check endpoint (e.g., `health.controller.ts`):

```plaintext
// health.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import { HealthCheckService, HealthCheck } from '@nestjs/terminus'

@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  constructor(private health: HealthCheckService) {}

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  check() {
    return this.health.check([])
  }
}
```

**4. Register the Controller:**

Register the `HealthController` in your `app.module.ts`:

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { TerminusModule } from '@nestjs/terminus'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { HealthController } from './health.controller'

@Module({
  imports: [TerminusModule],
  controllers: [AppController, HealthController],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, if you start your NestJS application and navigate to `/health`, you should see a basic health check response:

```plaintext
{
  "status": "ok",
  "info": {},
  "error": {},
  "details": {}
}
```

This indicates that the application itself is running. However, this is just the beginning. Let's add more meaningful health checks.

## Adding Health Indicators

`@nestjs/terminus` provides several built-in health indicators for common services and infrastructure components. Let's explore some key examples.

**1. Checking Database Connectivity:**

To check the health of your database connection, you'll need to install the corresponding database driver (e.g., `pg` for PostgreSQL, `mysql2` for MySQL, `mongodb` for MongoDB). For this example, we'll assume you're using PostgreSQL with `typeorm`.

First, install the necessary packages:

```plaintext
npm install --save typeorm pg
# or
yarn add typeorm pg
```

Next, configure TypeORM in your `app.module.ts`:

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { TerminusModule } from '@nestjs/terminus'
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm' // Import TypeOrmModule
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { HealthController } from './health.controller'

@Module({
  imports: [
    TerminusModule,
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      // Configure TypeORM
      type: 'postgres',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 5432,
      username: 'your_username',
      password: 'your_password',
      database: 'your_database',
      entities: [], // Add your entities here
      synchronize: true, // Disable in production!
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController, HealthController],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, update your `HealthController` to include a `TypeOrmHealthIndicator`:

```plaintext
// health.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import { HealthCheckService, HealthCheck, TypeOrmHealthIndicator } from '@nestjs/terminus'

@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health: HealthCheckService,
    private db: TypeOrmHealthIndicator // Inject TypeOrmHealthIndicator
  ) {}

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  check() {
    return this.health.check([
      () => this.db.pingCheck('database'), // Add the database health check
    ])
  }
}
```

The `pingCheck('database')` method attempts to establish a connection to the database. If successful, the health check passes. If it fails, the health check will report an error.

**2. Checking External API Availability:**

You can also check the availability of external APIs using the `HttpHealthIndicator`. Let's check the status of Google:

```plaintext
// health.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import {
  HealthCheckService,
  HealthCheck,
  TypeOrmHealthIndicator,
  HttpHealthIndicator,
} from '@nestjs/terminus'

@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health: HealthCheckService,
    private db: TypeOrmHealthIndicator,
    private http: HttpHealthIndicator // Inject HttpHealthIndicator
  ) {}

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  check() {
    return this.health.check([
      () => this.db.pingCheck('database'),
      () => this.http.pingCheck('google', 'https://www.google.com'), // Add the HTTP health check
    ])
  }
}
```

The `http.pingCheck('google', 'https://www.google.com')` method sends a HEAD request to `https://www.google.com`. If the request is successful (status code 200-299), the health check passes.

**3. Checking Microservice Health:**

If you are building a microservices architecture, you can check the health of other services using the `GrpcHealthIndicator` or the `HttpHealthIndicator`. Let's assume you want to check a service running on `http://localhost:3001/health`. You'd use the `HttpHealthIndicator` as shown above, pointing to the `/health` endpoint of the target service.

## Creating Custom Health Indicators

Sometimes, the built-in health indicators might not be sufficient for your needs. You can create custom health indicators to check specific aspects of your application's state.

**1. Define a Custom Health Indicator Class:**

Create a new class that extends the `HealthIndicator` class from `@nestjs/terminus`:

```plaintext
// memory.health.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { HealthIndicator, HealthIndicatorResult, HealthCheckError } from '@nestjs/terminus'
import { MemoryHealthIndicatorOptions } from '@nestjs/terminus/dist/health-indicator/memory.health'

@Injectable()
export class MemoryHealthIndicator extends HealthIndicator {
  async check(key: string, options: MemoryHealthIndicatorOptions): Promise<HealthIndicatorResult> {
    const memUsed = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed / 1024 / 1024
    const threshold = options.threshold || 150 // Default threshold 150MB

    const result =
      memUsed < threshold
        ? this.getStatus(key, true)
        : this.getStatus(key, false, { memoryUsageMB: memUsed })

    if (result[key].status === 'up') {
      return result
    } else {
      throw new HealthCheckError('Memory check failed', result)
    }
  }
}
```

This custom health indicator checks the heap used memory and returns an error if it exceeds the defined threshold.

**2. Inject and Use the Custom Health Indicator:**

Inject your custom health indicator into your `HealthController` and use it in the `check` method:

```plaintext
// health.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import {
  HealthCheckService,
  HealthCheck,
  TypeOrmHealthIndicator,
  HttpHealthIndicator,
} from '@nestjs/terminus'
import { MemoryHealthIndicator } from './memory.health'

@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health: HealthCheckService,
    private db: TypeOrmHealthIndicator,
    private http: HttpHealthIndicator,
    private memoryHealthIndicator: MemoryHealthIndicator // Inject MemoryHealthIndicator
  ) {}

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  check() {
    return this.health.check([
      () => this.db.pingCheck('database'),
      () => this.http.pingCheck('google', 'https://www.google.com'),
      () => this.memoryHealthIndicator.check('memory', { threshold: 200 }), // Add Memory Health Check
    ])
  }
}
```

**3. Register the Custom Health Indicator as a provider:**

Register `MemoryHealthIndicator` as a provider in `app.module.ts`:

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { TerminusModule } from '@nestjs/terminus'
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { HealthController } from './health.controller'
import { MemoryHealthIndicator } from './memory.health'

@Module({
  imports: [
    TerminusModule,
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      type: 'postgres',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 5432,
      username: 'your_username',
      password: 'your_password',
      database: 'your_database',
      entities: [],
      synchronize: true,
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController, HealthController],
  providers: [MemoryHealthIndicator], // Register MemoryHealthIndicator
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Advanced Considerations and Best Practices

- **Security:** Secure your health check endpoint. Consider requiring authentication or restricting access to specific IP addresses to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Performance:** Keep health checks lightweight and efficient. Avoid performing resource-intensive operations that could negatively impact application performance.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that your health checks accurately reflect the dependencies of your service. Include checks for critical data stores, external APIs, and other essential components.
- **Contextual Information:** Provide informative details in the health check response, such as version numbers, uptime, and resource usage. This can help with debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your health indicators to prevent unexpected exceptions from crashing the entire health check process.
- **Frequency:** Determine the appropriate frequency for running health checks. Too frequent checks can put unnecessary load on your system, while infrequent checks might miss critical issues.
- **Integration with Monitoring Systems:** Integrate your health check endpoint with your monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to visualize the health of your services and set up alerts for critical issues. `@nestjs/terminus` integrates nicely with Prometheus using custom endpoints and metrics.

## Conclusion

Implementing robust health checks is a vital practice for ensuring the availability and reliability of your NestJS applications. `@nestjs/terminus` provides a flexible and powerful framework for defining health indicators and integrating with various data sources and external services. By following the steps outlined in this guide and considering the best practices, you can create a comprehensive health check system that will help you proactively monitor, detect, and resolve issues before they impact your users.
