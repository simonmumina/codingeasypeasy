# SQL Server TAN() Function: Calculate Tangent in T-SQL with Examples

The `TAN()` function in SQL Server is a built-in mathematical function that calculates the tangent of an angle. Understanding and utilizing the `TAN()` function is crucial when dealing with trigonometric calculations within your SQL Server databases. This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to the `TAN()` function, covering its syntax, practical examples, and use cases.

## What is the TAN() Function?

The `TAN()` function in SQL Server returns the tangent of an angle specified in radians. Tangent is a fundamental trigonometric function defined as the ratio of the sine of an angle to its cosine. It's essential to remember that SQL Server's `TAN()` function expects the input angle to be in radians, not degrees.

## Syntax of the TAN() Function

The syntax of the `TAN()` function is straightforward:

```plaintext
TAN ( numeric_expression )
```

- `numeric_expression`: This is the angle, in radians, for which you want to calculate the tangent. It can be a column name containing numeric data, a constant value, or a more complex numeric expression. The `numeric_expression` must evaluate to a numeric data type (e.g., `INT`, `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`).

## Converting Degrees to Radians

Since the `TAN()` function requires the angle to be in radians, you'll often need to convert angles from degrees to radians. The conversion formula is:

- **radians = degrees \* (π / 180)**

SQL Server provides the `PI()` function, which returns the value of pi (π). Therefore, you can use the following formula within your SQL queries to convert degrees to radians:

```plaintext
degrees * PI() / 180
```

## Practical Examples of the TAN() Function

Let's explore several practical examples of how to use the `TAN()` function in SQL Server.

**Example 1: Calculating the Tangent of a Constant Value**

This example calculates the tangent of 45 degrees. First, we convert 45 degrees to radians, and then we pass the radian value to the `TAN()` function.

```plaintext
SELECT TAN(45 * PI() / 180) AS TangentOf45Degrees;
```

**Output:**

```
TangentOf45Degrees
---------------------
1

(1 row affected)
```

The output is approximately 1, which is the tangent of 45 degrees (or π/4 radians).

**Example 2: Calculating the Tangent of a Column Value**

Assume you have a table called `Angles` with a column named `AngleInDegrees` containing angle values in degrees. The following query calculates the tangent of each angle in the `AngleInDegrees` column.

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE Angles (
    AngleInDegrees DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Angles (AngleInDegrees) VALUES (30), (60), (90);

SELECT
    AngleInDegrees,
    TAN(AngleInDegrees * PI() / 180) AS Tangent
FROM
    Angles;

DROP TABLE Angles;
```

**Output:**

```
AngleInDegrees   Tangent
---------------  --------------------
30.00            0.577350269189626
60.00            1.73205080756888
90.00            6.12323399573677E+16

(3 rows affected)
```

Notice that the tangent of 90 degrees results in a very large number represented in scientific notation. This is because the tangent of 90 degrees (π/2 radians) is undefined (approaches infinity). SQL Server represents this as a very large floating-point number.

**Example 3: Handling NULL Values**

If the `numeric_expression` passed to the `TAN()` function is `NULL`, the function will return `NULL`.

```plaintext
SELECT TAN(NULL) AS TangentOfNull;
```

**Output:**

```
TangentOfNull
-------------
NULL

(1 row affected)
```

**Example 4: Using TAN() in a More Complex Calculation**

You can use the `TAN()` function as part of a larger calculation. For example, you might use it in a formula to determine the height of an object based on the angle of elevation and the distance to the object.

```plaintext
DECLARE @AngleInDegrees DECIMAL(10, 2) = 35;
DECLARE @DistanceToTheObject DECIMAL(10, 2) = 100;

SELECT @DistanceToTheObject * TAN(@AngleInDegrees * PI() / 180) AS ObjectHeight;
```

**Output:**

```
ObjectHeight
---------------------
70.020753820979

(1 row affected)
```

In this example, if the angle of elevation to the top of the object is 35 degrees and the distance to the object is 100 units, the height of the object is approximately 70.02 units.

## Considerations and Potential Issues

- **Radians vs. Degrees:** Always ensure that the angle you are passing to the `TAN()` function is in radians. Use the conversion formula `degrees * PI() / 180` to convert from degrees to radians.

- **Tangent of 90 Degrees (π/2 Radians):** The tangent of 90 degrees is undefined. SQL Server returns a very large number to represent this, which can lead to unexpected results in your calculations. Consider adding checks to handle angles approaching 90 degrees.

- **Data Types:** The `numeric_expression` must be a numeric data type. If you pass a non-numeric value, SQL Server will throw an error.

- **Accuracy:** Trigonometric functions are calculated using numerical approximation algorithms. The results might not be perfectly accurate due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.

## Use Cases for the TAN() Function

The `TAN()` function has various applications in SQL Server, including:

- **Engineering Calculations:** Calculating angles and distances in structural engineering, civil engineering, and mechanical engineering.
- **Game Development:** Determining trajectories, angles of reflection, and other geometric calculations in game development.
- **Graphics Programming:** Calculating transformations and projections in computer graphics.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzing relationships between angles and other variables in datasets.
- **Scientific Applications:** Performing trigonometric calculations in scientific simulations and research.

## Conclusion

The `TAN()` function in SQL Server is a powerful tool for performing trigonometric calculations within your database. By understanding its syntax, how to convert degrees to radians, and its limitations, you can effectively utilize the `TAN()` function in various applications. Remember to always validate your inputs and handle potential issues like the tangent of 90 degrees to ensure accurate and reliable results. By following the examples and guidelines in this blog post, you will be well-equipped to use the `TAN()` function in your SQL Server projects.
