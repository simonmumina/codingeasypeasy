# Svelte Reactivity Not Working? Understanding and Fixing Common Issues

Svelte makes building reactive user interfaces incredibly simple.  Its compiler does a lot of work under the hood to automatically update the DOM when your data changes.  However, occasionally, you might find yourself scratching your head, wondering why a variable change *isn't* triggering an update. This post delves into the common pitfalls that can prevent reactivity in Svelte and provides concrete solutions.

## What is Svelte Reactivity?

Before diving into the issues, let's quickly recap how Svelte's reactivity works.  Svelte uses assignments to trigger updates.  When you assign a new value to a variable in your Svelte component, the compiler recognizes this and generates code to update the DOM accordingly.  This is a powerful and declarative way to manage UI updates.  But, it relies on Svelte being able to *detect* that assignment.

## Common Reasons for Non-Reactive Variables

Here are the most frequent reasons why your Svelte variables might not be behaving reactively:

### 1. Direct Mutation of Objects and Arrays

This is the **most common culprit**. Svelte's reactivity is triggered by *assignment*, not by *mutation*.  If you directly modify an object or array, Svelte won't automatically detect the change because the variable itself hasn't been assigned a *new* value.  The variable still points to the same object or array in memory, even though its contents have changed.

**Example (Non-Reactive):**

```svelte
<script>
  let items = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

  function addItem() {
    items.push('grape'); // Direct mutation!
  }
</script>

<ul>
  {#each items as item}
    <li>{item}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>

<button on:click={addItem}>Add Item</button>
```

In this example, clicking "Add Item" will *not* update the list in the UI. `items` still references the same array in memory, so Svelte doesn't know to re-render.

**Solution: Create a New Array/Object**

To fix this, create a *new* array or object with the updated data and assign it to your variable. This triggers Svelte's reactivity.

```svelte
<script>
  let items = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

  function addItem() {
    items = [...items, 'grape']; // Create a new array!
  }
</script>

<ul>
  {#each items as item}
    <li>{item}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>

<button on:click={addItem}>Add Item</button>
```

By using the spread syntax (`...items`), we're creating a completely new array containing the original items plus the new one.  Assigning this new array to `items` triggers reactivity and updates the UI.

**Object Example:**

```svelte
<script>
  let user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

  function updateAge() {
    user.age = 31; // Direct mutation!
  }
</script>

<p>Name: {user.name}</p>
<p>Age: {user.age}</p>

<button on:click={updateAge}>Update Age</button>
```

Again, this won't work.  `user` is mutated directly.

**Solution:**

```svelte
<script>
  let user = { name: 'Alice', age: 30 };

  function updateAge() {
    user = { ...user, age: 31 }; // Create a new object!
  }
</script>

<p>Name: {user.name}</p>
<p>Age: {user.age}</p>

<button on:click={updateAge}>Update Age</button>
```

Using the spread syntax (`...user`) creates a new object with all the existing properties, and then we overwrite the `age` property with the new value.

### 2.  `let` vs. `$:` (Reactive Declarations)

While simple assignments like `count = count + 1` work for basic reactivity,  Svelte offers a more powerful way to define reactive statements using the `$:` syntax (reactive declarations).  These statements are re-executed whenever any of the variables they depend on change.

**Example:**

```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;
  let doubled;

  $: doubled = count * 2; // Reactive declaration

  function increment() {
    count = count + 1;
  }
</script>

<p>Count: {count}</p>
<p>Doubled: {doubled}</p>

<button on:click={increment}>Increment</button>
```

In this example, whenever `count` changes, the `$: doubled = count * 2` statement is automatically re-executed, updating the value of `doubled` and the UI.

**When to use `$:`:**

*   When you want to perform calculations or operations based on other reactive variables.
*   When you need to trigger side effects when a variable changes.
*   For more complex derived state.

**Gotcha:** Don't misuse `$:` for simple assignments.  For example, `$: count = count + 1;` is generally not necessary and can lead to unexpected behavior. The standard `count = count + 1;` is sufficient in most cases.

### 3.  Asynchronous Operations (Promises, `setTimeout`, etc.)

When dealing with asynchronous operations, the timing of variable updates can be tricky.  If you update a variable *after* the component has already rendered, Svelte might not pick up the change immediately.

**Example (Non-Reactive):**

```svelte
<script>
  let data = null;

  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    const json = await response.json();
    data = json; // Assignment after component render
  }

  fetchData();
</script>

{#if data}
  <p>Title: {data.title}</p>
{:else}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{/if}
```

While the code *will* eventually work, it might not be as smooth as you expect.  Svelte might not immediately update the UI after `data` is assigned the fetched JSON.

**Solution:  Awaiting Directly in the Component + `$:` (or `$:` Inside the `async` Function)**

Svelte offers a very elegant solution using the `{#await}` block:

```svelte
<script>
  let promise = fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
    .then(response => response.json());

</script>

{#await promise}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{:then data}
  <p>Title: {data.title}</p>
{/await}
```

This is the *preferred* approach. The `{await}` block handles the loading state and automatically updates the UI when the promise resolves.

Alternatively, you can use `$: ` inside the `async` function. This is less common and generally discouraged, but it is valid.

```svelte
<script>
  let data = null;

  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    const json = await response.json();
    $: data = json; // Reactive assignment inside async function
  }

  fetchData();
</script>

{#if data}
  <p>Title: {data.title}</p>
{:else}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{/if}
```

By prefixing `data = json;` with `$:`, we're telling Svelte that this assignment should be treated as a reactive statement.  However, the `{await}` block is generally clearer and more idiomatic.

**Another Solution for `setTimeout`:**

If you're using `setTimeout`, ensure the assignment happens *inside* the callback function.  This makes sure Svelte recognizes the change.

```svelte
<script>
  let message = 'Initial Message';

  function updateMessage() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      message = 'Message after 2 seconds'; // Assignment inside callback
    }, 2000);
  }

  updateMessage();
</script>

<p>{message}</p>
```

### 4.  Variables Not Declared in `<script>`

Ensure that all variables you intend to use reactively are declared within the `<script>` tag of your Svelte component.  Variables declared outside the `<script>` tag are not treated as reactive.

**Example (Non-Reactive):**

```svelte
<h1>Hello {name}!</h1> <!-- Name declared outside <script> -->

<script>
  // No declaration of 'name' here!
  function updateName() {
    name = 'Bob'; // This won't work as expected!
  }
</script>

<button on:click={updateName}>Update Name</button>
```

**Solution:**

```svelte
<script>
  let name = 'Alice'; // Name declared inside <script>

  function updateName() {
    name = 'Bob';
  }
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>

<button on:click={updateName}>Update Name</button>
```

### 5.  Props Passed from Parent Components

Props passed from parent components are reactive.  When the parent component updates a prop, the child component automatically re-renders. However, you shouldn't *directly* mutate a prop within a child component.  Treat props as read-only data flowing *down* the component tree.

**Example (Bad Practice):**

**Parent.svelte:**

```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count = count + 1;
  }
</script>

<Child count={count} />

<button on:click={increment}>Increment in Parent</button>
```

**Child.svelte:**

```svelte
<script>
  export let count;

  function incrementInChild() {
    count = count + 1; // DON'T DO THIS! Modifying a prop directly!
  }
</script>

<p>Count in Child: {count}</p>
<button on:click={incrementInChild}>Increment in Child</button>
```

Directly modifying the `count` prop in `Child.svelte` is an anti-pattern. While Svelte technically allows it, it's generally bad practice because it violates the one-way data flow principle and can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Solution: Use Event Dispatchers**

Instead of modifying the prop directly, the child component should dispatch an event to the parent component, signaling that the parent should update the data.

**Child.svelte:**

```svelte
<script>
  import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';

  export let count;
  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

  function incrementInChild() {
    dispatch('increment'); // Dispatch an 'increment' event
  }
</script>

<p>Count in Child: {count}</p>
<button on:click={incrementInChild}>Increment in Child</button>
```

**Parent.svelte:**

```svelte
<script>
  import Child from './Child.svelte';
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count = count + 1;
  }
</script>

<Child count={count} on:increment={increment} />  <!-- Listen for 'increment' event -->

<button on:click={increment}>Increment in Parent</button>
```

Now, the `Child` component dispatches an `increment` event, which the `Parent` component listens for and then updates its own `count` variable. This maintains a clear data flow and avoids unexpected side effects.

### 6. External Libraries

If you're using external libraries that manage state outside of Svelte's control, you might need to manually trigger updates. This usually involves subscribing to the library's state changes and then assigning the updated value to a Svelte variable.  Consult the library's documentation for details on how to subscribe to state updates.

### 7. Conditional Rendering and `key` Blocks

When using conditional rendering (`{#if}`, `{#each}`, etc.), Svelte might not always re-render components as you expect, especially if the data source is the same.  This is because Svelte tries to be efficient and reuse existing DOM elements.

**Example (Potential Issue):**

```svelte
<script>
  let showDetails = false;
  let item = { id: 1, name: 'Product A' };

  function toggleDetails() {
    showDetails = !showDetails;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={toggleDetails}>Toggle Details</button>

{#if showDetails}
  <Details item={item} />
{/if}
```

If the `item` object's properties change *while `showDetails` is already true*, the `Details` component might not always re-render immediately, even though `item` is a prop.

**Solution: Use `key` Blocks**

The `key` block forces Svelte to re-render a component when the key value changes. This is useful for ensuring that components are properly updated when their data changes, especially in conditional rendering scenarios.

```svelte
<script>
  let showDetails = false;
  let item = { id: 1, name: 'Product A' };

  function toggleDetails() {
    showDetails = !showDetails;
    item = { ...item, name: 'Product B' }; //Simulate changing the item
  }
</script>

<button on:click={toggleDetails}>Toggle Details</button>

{#if showDetails}
  {#key item}
      <Details item={item} />
  {/key}
{/if}
```

By wrapping the `<Details>` component in `{#key item}`, we're telling Svelte to treat it as a completely new component whenever the `item` variable changes.  This ensures that the `Details` component always reflects the latest data. The key can also be a unique property on the item such as `{ #key item.id}`.

### 8.  Unintentional Side Effects in Reactive Declarations

Be careful about introducing unintentional side effects within your reactive declarations (`$:`).  If a reactive declaration modifies a variable that *it also depends on*, it can lead to infinite loops and performance issues.

**Example (Potential Issue):**

```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;
  let message = '';

  $: if (count > 5) {
    message = 'Count is greater than 5!'; // Side effect that depends on 'count'
    count = 0; // Modification of 'count' within the reactive declaration!
  } else {
    message = 'Count is less than or equal to 5';
  }

  function increment() {
    count = count + 1;
  }
</script>

<p>Count: {count}</p>
<p>Message: {message}</p>

<button on:click={increment}>Increment</button>
```

In this example, when `count` becomes greater than 5, the reactive declaration sets `message` and then resets `count` to 0.  This triggers another execution of the reactive declaration (because `count` has changed), which sets `message` again, and so on, creating an infinite loop.

**Solution:  Separate Side Effects**

Avoid modifying the variables that your reactive declarations depend on. If you need to trigger a side effect, consider using a separate function or a different approach to manage the state.

### 9. Typos and Scope Issues

Sometimes, the issue is simply a typo or a scope problem. Double-check the spelling of your variable names and make sure that the variable is accessible in the scope where you're trying to use it. Svelte, while helpful, won't catch every typo or scope error immediately. A common error is accidentally creating a global variable. For example:

```svelte
<script>
  function increment() {
    counter = counter + 1; //Oops, counter wasn't declared. It will become a global variable.
  }
</script>
```

This would cause unpredictable behaviour as Svelte isn't tracking that 'counter' variable.

## Debugging Tips

When you're struggling with reactivity issues, these debugging tips can help:

*   **Console Logging:** Use `console.log()` to track the values of your variables at different points in your code.  This can help you identify when and where the variables are not updating as expected.
*   **Svelte Devtools:** The Svelte Devtools browser extension is invaluable for debugging Svelte applications.  It allows you to inspect the component tree, view the state of your components, and step through code execution.
*   **`{@debug}` Directive:** Svelte's `{@debug}` directive allows you to pause execution and inspect the current state of your component in the browser's debugger.  Simply insert `{@debug}` into your template to trigger a breakpoint.  You can specify variables as well to only trigger the breakpoint when the variables exist and have a value `{@debug count}`.
*   **Simplify:**  Start with a minimal example that reproduces the issue.  This makes it easier to isolate the problem and find a solution.
*   **Read the Documentation:** Svelte's official documentation is excellent.  It provides detailed explanations of reactivity, components, and other core concepts.

## Conclusion

Svelte's reactivity system is powerful and intuitive, but it's essential to understand how it works under the hood to avoid common pitfalls. By understanding the principles outlined in this post, you can effectively debug and resolve reactivity issues in your Svelte applications and build more robust and maintainable user interfaces. Remember to favor assignment over mutation, leverage reactive declarations when appropriate, and be mindful of asynchronous operations and props. Happy Svelting!
