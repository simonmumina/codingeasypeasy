# Mastering NPM Scripts: A Comprehensive Guide for JavaScript Developers

NPM scripts are a powerful yet often overlooked feature of Node.js development. They allow you to define and run custom commands directly from your `package.json` file, streamlining development workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and improving project maintainability. This comprehensive guide will delve deep into the world of NPM scripts, equipping you with the knowledge and practical examples to become a master of build automation.

## What are NPM Scripts?

At its core, an NPM script is a command defined within the `"scripts"` object of your `package.json` file. These commands can range from simple single-line executions to complex sequences of commands that orchestrate entire build processes. Think of them as mini-programs that you can execute directly from your terminal using the `npm run <script-name>` command.

**Why use NPM Scripts?**

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks like building your project, running tests, deploying to production, and more.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that all developers on your team are using the same build processes, leading to more consistent results.
- **Convenience:** Execute complex commands with a single, easy-to-remember command.
- **Portability:** NPM scripts are defined within your project's `package.json`, making them easily shareable and portable across different environments.
- **Integration:** NPM scripts integrate seamlessly with other Node.js tools and libraries.
- **Reduce Dependencies:** Often, you can avoid using external task runners like Gulp or Grunt for simpler projects by leveraging the power of NPM scripts.

## Anatomy of the `package.json` Scripts Object

The `scripts` object in your `package.json` file is where the magic happens. Here's a basic example:

```plaintext
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple project using NPM scripts",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "webpack",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .js",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "jest": "^27.0.0",
    "prettier": "^2.0.0",
    "webpack": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`"scripts"`:** This object contains all the defined NPM scripts.
- **`"start"`:** This script is executed when you run `npm start`. It typically starts your application. In this example, it runs `node index.js`. Note that `start`, `test`, `stop`, `restart` and `pre`/`post` commands are special and can be run with just `npm <command>`.
- **`"test"`:** This script is executed when you run `npm test`. It's used for running your project's tests (using Jest in this example).
- **`"build"`:** This script is executed when you run `npm run build`. It's commonly used for building your project for production (using Webpack in this example).
- **`"lint"`:** This script is executed when you run `npm run lint`. It runs ESLint to check your code for stylistic and potential error issues.
- **`"format"`:** This script is executed when you run `npm run format`. It uses Prettier to automatically format your code according to defined style rules.

## Running NPM Scripts

You can execute an NPM script using the following command:

```plaintext
npm run <script-name>
```

For example, to run the `build` script defined above, you would execute:

```plaintext
npm run build
```

**Shorthand for `start`, `test`, `stop`, `restart`:**

As mentioned previously, `start`, `test`, `stop`, and `restart` are special script names that can be run with a shorter syntax:

- `npm start` (equivalent to `npm run start`)
- `npm test` (equivalent to `npm run test`)
- `npm stop` (equivalent to `npm run stop`)
- `npm restart` (equivalent to `npm run restart`)

## Examples of Common NPM Scripts

Here are some more practical examples of common NPM scripts:

- **Building a React application with Webpack:**

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "webpack --mode production"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Running a development server:**

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "webpack-dev-server --mode development"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Running tests with Jest and generating coverage reports:**

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "test": "jest --coverage"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Deploying to Netlify:**

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "deploy": "netlify deploy --prod"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Building a static site with a static site generator (e.g., Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js):**

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "next build && next export"
    }
  }
  ```

## Advanced NPM Script Techniques

NPM scripts offer several advanced techniques to enhance your build automation:

### 1. Chaining Commands

You can chain multiple commands together using `&&` (AND) or `||` (OR) operators.

- **`&&` (AND):** Executes the next command only if the previous command succeeds (exits with a code of 0).

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "build": "eslint . && webpack --mode production"
    }
  }
  ```

  This script will first run ESLint. If ESLint finds no errors, it will then run Webpack. If ESLint finds errors, Webpack will _not_ run.

- **`||` (OR):** Executes the next command only if the previous command fails (exits with a non-zero code). This is useful for providing fallback commands.

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "deploy": "netlify deploy --prod || echo 'Deployment failed!'"
    }
  }
  ```

  This script will attempt to deploy to Netlify. If the deployment fails, it will print "Deployment failed!" to the console.

### 2. Variables and Environment Variables

You can use environment variables within your NPM scripts. NPM automatically makes environment variables available to your scripts. You can access them using the `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax. You can also define custom variables within your `package.json` using the `config` key.

```plaintext
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "config": {
    "port": 3000
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js --port ${npm_package_config_port}",
    "dev": "node index.js --port ${npm_package_config_port} --debug"
  }
}
```

In this example:

- `npm_package_config_port` is an environment variable automatically created by NPM, based on the `config.port` value. You can access any values defined in the `config` section this way.
- The `start` script starts the application using the configured port.
- The `dev` script starts the application in debug mode, also using the configured port.

You can also use regular environment variables defined outside the `package.json` file:

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "netlify deploy --prod --auth-token ${NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN}"
  }
}
```

In this case, `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` needs to be defined in your system's environment variables.

### 3. Pre and Post Scripts

NPM allows you to define `pre` and `post` scripts that run before and after a specific script. To define them, prefix or suffix the script name with `pre` or `post` respectively.

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "echo 'Starting build...'",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "postbuild": "echo 'Build complete!'",
    "test": "jest",
    "pretest": "echo 'Starting tests...' "
  }
}
```

When you run `npm run build`, the following will happen:

1.  The `prebuild` script will execute (printing "Starting build...").
2.  The `build` script will execute (running Webpack).
3.  The `postbuild` script will execute (printing "Build complete!").

When you run `npm test`, the following will happen:

1.  The `pretest` script will execute (printing "Starting tests...")
2.  The `test` script will execute (running Jest).

### 4. Running Node Scripts Directly

You can execute node.js scripts directly from within your scripts section. For example if you have a file named `scripts/my-script.js`, you can run it as follows:

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "my-custom-script": "node scripts/my-script.js"
  }
}
```

Then just execute `npm run my-custom-script`

### 5. Using third party libraries

Using cross-env

If you are working on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), you may encounter issues related to environment variable setting that vary between platforms. Cross-env is a small utility that allows setting environment variables that work consistently on all platforms.

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev cross-env
```

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --mode production"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices for NPM Scripts

- **Keep Scripts Concise:** For complex tasks, consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable scripts. You can then chain these scripts together.

- **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose clear and descriptive names for your scripts to make them easy to understand.

- **Document Your Scripts:** Add comments to your `package.json` to explain what each script does.

- **Version Control Your `package.json`:** Ensure your `package.json` is under version control to track changes to your scripts.

- **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Don't try to do everything with NPM scripts. If your build process becomes too complex, consider using a dedicated task runner or build tool.

- **Use `--` to pass arguments:** If you want to pass arguments to a command inside your npm script you can use `--` to signal the start of the arguments

  ```plaintext
  {
    "scripts": {
      "test": "jest"
    }
  }
  ```

  ```plaintext
  npm test -- -t MyComponent #This executes jest with -t MyComponent, in order to run only tests related to MyComponent
  ```
