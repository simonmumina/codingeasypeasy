# How to Make CMD Speak Text: A Comprehensive Guide to Text-to-Speech in Windows Command Line

Have you ever wanted your computer to talk to you directly from the command line? Imagine your scripts giving you status updates, alerts, or even reading out long pieces of text. With the power of Windows' built-in scripting capabilities and the Speech API (SAPI), this is entirely possible! This guide will walk you through several methods to achieve text-to-speech (TTS) functionality within the Windows Command Prompt (CMD), providing detailed code examples and explanations to help you get started.

## Introduction to Text-to-Speech in CMD

The Windows operating system comes equipped with a powerful API called SAPI (Speech API), which allows developers to integrate speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities into their applications. We can leverage this API from within CMD using VBScript, a scripting language native to Windows. While PowerShell is a more modern and often preferred scripting environment, VBScript offers a simple and readily available solution for adding TTS to your CMD scripts.

## Method 1: Using `mshta` and VBScript (The One-Liner)

The most concise way to make CMD speak text is by using the `mshta` command in conjunction with a VBScript one-liner.  `mshta.exe` is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (`.hta` files), which can contain HTML, CSS, and scripting languages like VBScript.

Here's the basic command:

```cmd
mshta vbscript:Execute("CreateObject(""SAPI.SpVoice"").Speak(""Hello World!"")(window.close)")
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`mshta`**: This command invokes the Microsoft HTML Application host.
*   **`vbscript:Execute(...)`**: This tells `mshta` to execute the VBScript code within the parentheses.
*   **`CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice")`**: This creates an instance of the `SAPI.SpVoice` object, which is the main interface for controlling text-to-speech functionality.
*   **`.Speak("Hello World!")`**: This calls the `Speak` method of the `SAPI.SpVoice` object, telling it to speak the text "Hello World!".  Remember to escape double quotes within the string with another double quote.
*   **`(window.close)`**: This part ensures that the `mshta` process closes after speaking, preventing unnecessary resource usage.

**Example in a Batch File:**

```batch
@echo off
mshta vbscript:Execute("CreateObject(""SAPI.SpVoice"").Speak(""This is a test from my batch script."")(window.close)")
pause
```

Save this as `speak.bat` and run it. You should hear your computer speak the specified text.

**Pros:**

*   Extremely concise.
*   Easy to use for simple text-to-speech tasks.

**Cons:**

*   Can be harder to read and maintain for complex scripts.
*   Limited control over speech parameters (volume, rate, voice).

## Method 2: Creating a Separate VBScript File

For more complex scenarios, creating a separate VBScript file is recommended. This allows for better organization and more control over the speech parameters.

**Step 1: Create a VBScript File (e.g., `speak.vbs`)**

```vbscript
Dim SpVoice, Speech
Set SpVoice = CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice")
Speech = WScript.Arguments(0) ' Get the text from the command line

SpVoice.Speak Speech

Set SpVoice = Nothing
Set Speech = Nothing
WScript.Quit
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`Dim SpVoice, Speech`**: Declares the variables `SpVoice` and `Speech`.
*   **`Set SpVoice = CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice")`**: Creates an instance of the `SAPI.SpVoice` object.
*   **`Speech = WScript.Arguments(0)`**: Retrieves the first argument passed to the script from the command line and assigns it to the `Speech` variable. `WScript.Arguments` provides access to the arguments passed to the VBScript.
*   **`SpVoice.Speak Speech`**: Speaks the text stored in the `Speech` variable.
*   **`Set SpVoice = Nothing`**: Releases the `SpVoice` object from memory.  This is good practice to prevent memory leaks.
*   **`Set Speech = Nothing`**: Releases the `Speech` object from memory.  This is good practice to prevent memory leaks.
*   **`WScript.Quit`**: Exits the script.

**Step 2: Call the VBScript from CMD**

```cmd
cscript //nologo speak.vbs "Hello, this is a longer message spoken from a VBScript file!"
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`cscript`**: This is the command-line host for VBScript.
*   **`//nologo`**: This option suppresses the display of the VBScript logo and version information.
*   **`speak.vbs`**: Specifies the VBScript file to execute.
*   **`"Hello, this is a longer message spoken from a VBScript file!"`**:  This is the text that will be passed as an argument to the VBScript.

**Example in a Batch File:**

```batch
@echo off
cscript //nologo speak.vbs "This is text spoken from VBScript called from a Batch file."
pause
```

**Pros:**

*   More organized and readable code.
*   Allows for passing arguments to the script, making it more flexible.

**Cons:**

*   Requires creating a separate file.

## Method 3: Advanced Control with VBScript and SAPI

For advanced control over the speech synthesis process, you can modify the VBScript to adjust various parameters such as:

*   **Voice:** Choose a specific voice from the available voices on your system.
*   **Rate:** Adjust the speaking rate (speed).
*   **Volume:** Control the volume of the speech.

**Modified VBScript (e.g., `speak_advanced.vbs`)**

```vbscript
Dim SpVoice, Speech, Rate, Volume, Voice

Set SpVoice = CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice")

' Set Voice (Optional - find installed voices and use one)
' Dim oVoice
' For Each oVoice In SpVoice.GetVoices
'     WScript.Echo oVoice.GetDescription & " - " & oVoice.Id
' Next
' SpVoice.Voice = "Microsoft David Desktop" ' Replace with the desired Voice ID

' Set Speech Rate (-10 to 10, 0 is default)
SpVoice.Rate = 2 'Increase speech rate

' Set Volume (0 to 100)
SpVoice.Volume = 100

Speech = WScript.Arguments(0)
SpVoice.Speak Speech

Set SpVoice = Nothing
Set Speech = Nothing
WScript.Quit
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`SpVoice.Rate = 2`**:  Sets the speaking rate to 2 (slightly faster than the default). The rate ranges from -10 (slowest) to 10 (fastest).
*   **`SpVoice.Volume = 100`**: Sets the volume to the maximum value (100). The volume ranges from 0 to 100.
*   **`SpVoice.Voice = "Microsoft David Desktop"`**: This (commented out) code snippet shows how you can select a specific voice. First, you can uncomment the loop to list all available voices on your system, identifying each voice's "Description" and "Id".  Then, replace `"Microsoft David Desktop"` with the actual `Id` of the voice you want to use.  This ensures consistent voice output across different machines, as long as the chosen voice is installed.

**How to find available voices:** Uncomment the loop in the VBScript to list all the voices installed on your system. Run the script without any arguments:

```cmd
cscript //nologo speak_advanced.vbs
```

This will display a list of available voices and their corresponding IDs in the command prompt.

**CMD Command to Run:**

```cmd
cscript //nologo speak_advanced.vbs "This is spoken with adjusted rate and volume."
```

**Pros:**

*   Fine-grained control over speech parameters.
*   Customize the voice, rate, and volume.

**Cons:**

*   More complex script.
*   Requires understanding SAPI properties and methods.

## Troubleshooting Tips

*   **"ActiveX component can't create object: 'SAPI.SpVoice'"**: This error usually indicates that SAPI is not properly installed or configured on your system. Ensure that the Speech API is enabled in Windows Features.  Navigate to "Control Panel" -> "Programs" -> "Programs and Features" -> "Turn Windows features on or off", and make sure that "Speech Support" is checked.
*   **No Sound:**  Check your volume settings, speakers, and sound card drivers.  Ensure that the correct audio output device is selected.
*   **Script Errors:**  Double-check your VBScript code for syntax errors. Use a VBScript debugger or add `WScript.Echo` statements to help identify the source of the problem.
*   **Permissions:** Ensure that the user account running the script has sufficient permissions to access the Speech API.
*   **Escaping Characters:**  Remember to properly escape special characters (like double quotes) in the text string passed to the `Speak` method.
