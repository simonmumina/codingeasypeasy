# EAS Update: Streamline OTA Updates and Share Previews with Your Team Using Expo Application Services

Over-the-air (OTA) updates are a game-changer for React Native developers. They allow you to ship bug fixes, new features, and improvements to your users without forcing them to download a new version from the app store. Expo Application Services (EAS) Update simplifies this process, providing a robust and reliable solution for managing and deploying updates to your Expo-based apps.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamentals of EAS Update, demonstrating how to set it up, trigger updates, and share preview builds effectively with your team.

## What is EAS Update?

EAS Update is a service provided by Expo that enables you to deliver updates to your React Native apps directly to your users' devices, bypassing the traditional app store release cycle. It's a powerful tool for:

- **Faster Bug Fixes:** Address critical issues immediately without waiting for app store review processes.
- **Rapid Feature Iteration:** Quickly roll out new features and improvements based on user feedback.
- **Reduced App Store Overhead:** Minimize the need for frequent app store submissions, saving time and effort.
- **Improved User Experience:** Provide a smoother, more responsive experience for your users.
- **Efficient Team Collaboration:** Share previews and test updates with your team before releasing them to the public.

## Getting Started with EAS Update

Before diving into the practical steps, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Expo Account:** Create an account on [https://expo.dev/](https://expo.dev/).
- **Expo CLI:** Install the Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
- **React Native Project:** You need an existing React Native project created with Expo. If you don't have one, initialize a new project with `expo init YourProjectName`.
- **EAS CLI:** Install the EAS CLI globally using `npm install -g eas-cli` or `yarn global add eas-cli`.

### 1. Configure your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`)

The first step is to configure your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file to enable EAS Update. Add the following configuration to your `expo` object:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "YourAppName",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "updates": {
      "url": "https://u.expo.dev/[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]"
    },
    "runtimeVersion": {
      "policy": "sdkVersion" // or nativeVersion
    },
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": ["**/*"],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourappname"
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
      },
      "package": "com.yourcompany.yourappname"
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    },
    "plugins": ["@react-native-community/netinfo"]
  }
}
```

**Key Configuration Options:**

- **`updates.url`:** This is where your app will check for updates. **Replace `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`** with your actual Expo project ID, which you can find on the Expo dashboard after initializing your project with `eas build`.
- **`runtimeVersion.policy`:** Defines how the update client verifies compatibility between updates and the app's runtime.
  - **`sdkVersion` (Recommended):** Limits updates to be compatible only with the exact same Expo SDK version that the app was built with. This is the safest and most recommended option.
  - **`nativeVersion`:** Uses the `version` field in your `app.json` to manage compatibility. Updates will only apply if the version code (iOS) or versionCode (Android) of the update is greater than the version installed on the device. Requires more manual management.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Bundle Identifier/Package Name:** Ensure your `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` are correctly configured. These are crucial for identifying your app in the app stores and for OTA updates to function correctly.

### 2. Initialize EAS Project

Run the following command in your project directory to initialize EAS:

```plaintext
eas init
```

The CLI will guide you through the initialization process, asking questions about your project and platform. Choose the "managed" workflow when prompted.

### 3. Build your App with EAS Build

Before you can send OTA updates, you need to build your app using EAS Build. This process will create the initial build that will be distributed through the app stores (or internally for testing).

```plaintext
eas build -p android --profile development
eas build -p ios --profile development
```

Or, to create production builds for the app store:

```plaintext
eas build -p android
eas build -p ios
```

**Important:** After building your app, submit it to the app stores or distribute it internally if you haven't already. This provides the base version that will be updated using OTA updates. The build process creates the necessary metadata for EAS Update to function correctly. The development builds are essential for the next step of previewing updates.

### 4. Implement the `Updates` API in your App

To use EAS Update, you need to integrate the `expo-updates` library into your app.

First, install the library:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-updates
```

Now, add the following code to your `App.js` or entry point file:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Platform } from 'react-native'
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates'

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function updateApp() {
      try {
        const update = await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()
        if (update.isAvailable) {
          await Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()
          await Updates.reloadAsync()
        }
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(`Error checking for updates: ${e}`)
      }
    }

    if (Platform.OS === 'android' || Platform.OS === 'ios') {
      updateApp()
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      <Text>This is version 1.0.0</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()`:** Checks if an update is available on the EAS Update server.
- **`Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()`:** Downloads the new update.
- **`Updates.reloadAsync()`:** Restarts the application to apply the downloaded update.

**Important Notes:**

- **Platform Check:** The code includes a platform check (`Platform.OS === 'android' || Platform.OS === 'ios'`) to ensure the update logic is only executed on mobile devices.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle situations where updates cannot be fetched or applied. Consider displaying a message to the user or logging the error for debugging.
- **Update Frequency:** Control how often the app checks for updates. Checking too frequently can impact performance and battery life. You can adjust the timing and frequency based on your application's needs.
- **User Experience:** Provide clear feedback to the user during the update process. Consider displaying a loading indicator or progress bar to inform them that an update is being downloaded and applied.

### 5. Publishing Updates

Now that your app is configured for EAS Update, you can publish updates using the EAS CLI:

```plaintext
eas update
```

The CLI will prompt you to enter a message describing the update. This message will be associated with the update and can be helpful for tracking changes.

**Targeting Updates with Channels:**

EAS Update uses the concept of "channels" to manage different update streams. By default, all updates are published to the `default` channel. You can create and target specific channels for different purposes, such as:

- **Staging:** A channel for testing updates internally before releasing them to production.
- **Production:** The main channel for releasing updates to your users.
- **Beta:** A channel for distributing updates to beta testers.
- **Specific User Groups:** Target updates to specific segments of your user base.

To publish to a specific channel, use the `--channel` flag:

```plaintext
eas update --channel staging
```

You can also set the channel in your `eas.json` file:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": "latest"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  },
  "update": {
    "staging": {
      "channel": "staging"
    },
    "production": {
      "channel": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run `eas update --profile staging`.

### 6. Sharing Previews with your Team

EAS Update simplifies the process of sharing preview builds with your team for testing and feedback. By combining EAS Build with Internal Distribution, you can create builds and share updates quickly.

**Steps for Sharing Previews:**

1.  **Build for Internal Distribution:** When building your app with EAS Build, use the `--distribution internal` flag and choose the "development" profile.

    ```plaintext
    eas build -p android --profile development --distribution internal
    eas build -p ios --profile development --distribution internal
    ```

2.  **Invite Team Members:** Add your team members as collaborators to your Expo project on the Expo website. You can also use groups in EAS to manage permissions.

3.  **Share the Install Link:** Once the build is complete, EAS Build will generate a link that you can share with your team members. When they click the link, they will be prompted to install the app on their device.

4.  **Publish Updates to a Preview Channel:** Create a dedicated channel for preview builds (e.g., `preview`).

    ```plaintext
    eas update --channel preview
    ```

5.  **Team Members Test Updates:** Team members who have installed the preview build will automatically receive updates published to the `preview` channel.

**Benefits of using EAS Update for Preview Builds:**

- **Simplified Distribution:** No need to manage complicated provisioning profiles or distribution certificates.
- **Faster Iteration:** Quickly share updates and gather feedback from your team.
- **Centralized Management:** Track updates and manage team access through the Expo dashboard.

## Advanced EAS Update Features

EAS Update offers several advanced features that can help you optimize your update process:

- **Rollbacks:** If an update introduces a critical bug, you can easily roll back to the previous version.
- **Phased Rollouts:** Gradually release updates to a percentage of your users to monitor for issues before rolling them out to everyone.
- **Conditional Updates:** Target updates to specific users based on their device, location, or other criteria.
- **Branching:** Create dedicated channels for different versions or features, allowing you to test and deploy them independently.
- **Monorepo Support:** Easily manage updates for multiple apps within a single repository. You'll need to specify the root directory for your expo project in the `app.json`.

## Best Practices for EAS Update

- **Thorough Testing:** Always test your updates thoroughly before releasing them to production. Use staging and preview channels to test updates in a controlled environment.
- **Clear Communication:** Inform your users about updates and any potential changes to the app.
- **Versioning:** Use a clear versioning strategy to track updates and manage compatibility.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor your app for errors and crashes after releasing an update.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your update logic to gracefully handle situations where updates fail.
- **Security:** Protect your EAS Update credentials and ensure that your update server is secure.
- **Optimize Update Size:** Keep your update size as small as possible to minimize download times and battery consumption. This includes optimizing images, removing unused code, and using code splitting techniques.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Updates Not Applying:**
  - Verify that your `app.json` is correctly configured with the `updates.url` and `runtimeVersion.policy`.
  - Ensure that the `expo-updates` library is installed and properly integrated into your app.
  - Check the console logs for any error messages related to update fetching or applying.
  - Verify that your app is connected to the internet.
- **Build Errors:**
  - Review the EAS Build logs for any error messages.
  - Ensure that your EAS credentials are valid and that you have the necessary permissions.
  - Check your `app.json` for any configuration errors.
- **Channel Issues:**
  - Verify that you are publishing updates to the correct channel.
  - Ensure that your app is configured to check for updates on the correct channel.
  - Double-check your EAS configuration files for any channel-related errors.
