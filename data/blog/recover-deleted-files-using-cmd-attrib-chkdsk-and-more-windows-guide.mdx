# Recover Deleted Files Using CMD: attrib, chkdsk, and More (Windows Guide)

Losing important files can be a stressful experience. While dedicated data recovery software often provides the best results, sometimes you can recover deleted files using built-in Windows tools through the command prompt (CMD). This guide will walk you through several techniques, including the `attrib` command, `chkdsk`, and exploring temporary files, to help you recover your lost data.

## Understanding File Deletion in Windows

Before diving into the recovery methods, it's crucial to understand what happens when you "delete" a file in Windows:

*   **Recycle Bin:**  If you delete a file by dragging it to the Recycle Bin or pressing the "Delete" key, the file isn't actually removed from your hard drive. It's simply moved to the Recycle Bin folder and marked as "deleted." You can easily restore it from there.

*   **Shift + Delete:**  Using "Shift + Delete" permanently deletes the file, bypassing the Recycle Bin.  This *doesn't* necessarily mean the data is immediately overwritten. The file's entry in the file system is removed, and the space it occupied is marked as available for reuse.  Until that space is overwritten by new data, the file may still be recoverable.

*   **Deleted from USB drives/SD cards:** Files deleted from external drives (like USB sticks and SD cards) usually bypass the Recycle Bin entirely and are marked as deleted.

This guide focuses on recovering files that have been "permanently deleted" (i.e., removed from the Recycle Bin or deleted using Shift + Delete). Keep in mind that the success of these methods depends on how long ago the file was deleted and whether the space has been overwritten.  The sooner you attempt recovery, the higher your chances of success.

## Method 1: Using the `attrib` Command to Recover Hidden Files

The `attrib` command is a powerful tool for modifying file attributes, including hidden and system attributes.  Sometimes, files might appear to be deleted when they've actually been hidden by malware or system errors.

**How to use `attrib` to find hidden files:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**  Press the Windows key, type "cmd," right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator." This is crucial, as you need elevated privileges to modify file attributes.

2.  **Navigate to the Drive:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the drive where you suspect the deleted files were located. For example, if the files were on your D: drive, type `D:` and press Enter.

3.  **Run the `attrib` Command:**  This is the core of the process. Use the following command:

    ```cmd
    attrib -h -r -s /s /d *.*
    ```

    Let's break down this command:

    *   `attrib`:  The command itself.
    *   `-h`: Removes the "hidden" attribute.
    *   `-r`: Removes the "read-only" attribute.
    *   `-s`: Removes the "system" attribute.
    *   `/s`:  Applies the command to all files and subfolders within the current directory.
    *   `/d`: Applies the command to directories as well.
    *   `*.*`:  Specifies all files.

4.  **Check for Recovered Files:** After running the command, explore the drive (D: in our example) using File Explorer.  Look for any files that were previously missing.  They might now be visible.  You might need to sort by date modified to find recently uncovered files.

**Example:**

Let's say you deleted files from the "Documents" folder on your C: drive. You would:

1.  Open CMD as Administrator
2.  Type `cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents` (replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual username) and press Enter.
3.  Type `attrib -h -r -s /s /d *.*` and press Enter.
4.  Open File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents`.  Look for any files that were previously hidden.

**Important Notes about `attrib`:**

*   **Understanding Attributes:** The `attrib` command manipulates file attributes. Incorrectly using it can potentially make system files visible, which is generally not recommended. Be cautious and understand what you're doing.
*   **Limitations:** This method primarily recovers files that were *hidden*, not actually deleted. If the file entry has been completely removed from the file system, `attrib` won't help.

## Method 2: Using `chkdsk` (Check Disk) to Repair File System Errors

The `chkdsk` (Check Disk) utility is used to verify and repair the file system integrity of a disk volume.  Sometimes, file system errors can cause files to become inaccessible or appear as if they've been deleted.

**How to use `chkdsk` to check for file system errors:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**  As before, press the Windows key, type "cmd," right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator."

2.  **Run the `chkdsk` Command:**  Use the following command, replacing `X:` with the drive letter you want to check:

    ```cmd
    chkdsk X: /f /r /x
    ```

    Let's break down this command:

    *   `chkdsk`: The command itself.
    *   `X:`:  The drive letter to check (e.g., `C:`, `D:`, `E:`).
    *   `/f`:  Fixes errors on the disk.  This is the most important flag for our purpose.
    *   `/r`:  Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information.  This process takes a *long* time.
    *   `/x`:  Forces the volume to dismount first, if necessary.  This is often required for the C: drive.

3.  **Schedule `chkdsk` on Reboot (if required):** If you're running `chkdsk` on the C: drive, Windows will likely prompt you to schedule the check on the next system restart.  Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm.  Then, restart your computer.

4.  **Allow `chkdsk` to Run:** During the startup process, `chkdsk` will run and attempt to repair any file system errors it finds. This can take a considerable amount of time, depending on the size of the drive and the extent of the errors.

5.  **Check for Recovered Files:** After `chkdsk` completes and your computer restarts, explore the drive using File Explorer.  Look for any files that were previously missing.  `chkdsk` sometimes creates "FOUND.XXX" folders on the root of the drive containing recovered file fragments.  You may need to examine these folders to see if your files are there.

**Example:**

To check the D: drive for file system errors, you would:

1.  Open CMD as Administrator.
2.  Type `chkdsk D: /f /r /x` and press Enter.
3.  Wait for `chkdsk` to complete (it might take a while).
4.  Open File Explorer and navigate to the D: drive.  Look for recovered files or `FOUND.XXX` folders.

**Important Notes about `chkdsk`:**

*   **Time Commitment:** Running `chkdsk` with the `/r` option can take a very long time, especially on large drives. Be prepared to wait.
*   **Potential Data Loss:** While `chkdsk` aims to repair file system errors, in some cases, it can lead to data loss if it encounters severely corrupted files.  It's always a good idea to back up your important data before running `chkdsk`.
*   **`FOUND.XXX` Folders:**  If `chkdsk` finds corrupted file fragments, it may place them in `FOUND.XXX` folders on the root of the drive. These files will have generic names like `FILE0000.CHK`.  You'll need to examine them individually to see if they contain any of your lost data. You can try opening them with a text editor, image viewer, or other appropriate program based on the expected file type.

## Method 3: Exploring Temporary Files (TEMP Folders)

Sometimes, applications create temporary files as backups or for internal processes.  If a file was recently deleted or corrupted due to a program crash, there's a chance a temporary version might exist.

**How to find temporary files:**

1.  **Show Hidden Files and Folders:** Open File Explorer, go to the "View" tab, and check the "Hidden items" box. This will make hidden folders (including the TEMP folders) visible.

2.  **Locate the TEMP Folders:**  There are usually two main TEMP folders:

    *   **User TEMP Folder:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Temp` (replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual username)
    *   **System TEMP Folder:** `C:\Windows\Temp`

3.  **Search for Relevant Files:**  Within these folders, search for files that might resemble the deleted file.  Look for files with extensions like `.tmp`, `.bak`, `.~`, or filenames similar to the original file.  Sort by date modified to find recently created files.

4.  **Open and Examine the Files:**  Try opening any potentially relevant files with the appropriate application (e.g., open a `.tmp` file with Notepad if it's a text file, or with Word if it's a document).

**Example:**

Suppose you were working on a Word document called "ImportantReport.docx" and it got corrupted. You would:

1.  Show Hidden Items in File Explorer.
2.  Navigate to `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Temp`.
3.  Search for files with names like "ImportantReport.tmp" or "ImportantReport.bak" or files created around the time the document was corrupted.
4.  Try opening these files with Microsoft Word.

**Important Notes about TEMP Folders:**

*   **Large Volume of Files:**  TEMP folders often contain a large number of files, many of which are irrelevant.  Be prepared to sift through a lot of data.
*   **Temporary Nature:**  Temporary files are often deleted automatically by Windows or applications.  The longer you wait, the less likely you are to find anything useful.
*   **Security Concerns:**  Be cautious when opening files from TEMP folders, as they could potentially contain malware.  Scan them with an antivirus program before opening them.

## Method 4: Using Windows File Recovery (Microsoft's Command-Line Tool)

Microsoft provides a command-line tool called "Windows File Recovery" specifically designed for recovering deleted files.  It's available for free from the Microsoft Store.  It offers more advanced recovery options than the standard `attrib` and `chkdsk` commands, but it requires some command-line expertise.

**How to Use Windows File Recovery:**

1.  **Download and Install Windows File Recovery:**  Search for "Windows File Recovery" in the Microsoft Store and install it.

2.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**  As before, press the Windows key, type "cmd," right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator."

3.  **Understand the Command Syntax:**  The basic command syntax is:

    ```cmd
    winfr source-drive: destination-drive: [/mode] [/switches]
    ```

    *   `source-drive:`: The drive where the deleted files were located (e.g., `C:`, `D:`).
    *   `destination-drive:`:  A different drive where the recovered files will be saved (e.g., `E:`).  *Important: Do not recover files to the same drive they were deleted from, as this can overwrite the data you're trying to recover!*
    *   `/mode`: The recovery mode. There are two modes:
        *   `Regular`:  For recovering recently deleted files on NTFS drives.
        *   `Extensive`:  For recovering files from formatted drives, damaged drives, or older files.  It takes longer but can be more effective.
    *   `/switches`:  Additional options to refine the search, such as specifying the file type, filename, or folder.

4.  **Choose the Recovery Mode:**  Start with the `Regular` mode if the files were recently deleted. If that doesn't work, try `Extensive`.

5.  **Use Switches to Filter the Search:**  Common switches include:

    *   `/n <filename>`:  Specifies the filename to recover (e.g., `/n ImportantReport.docx`).
    *   `/y:<file type>`:  Specifies the file type to recover (e.g., `/y:docx`). You can use wildcards (e.g., `/y:doc*`).
    *   `/p:<folder>`: Specifies the folder path to search (e.g. `/p:"Documents\MyFolder"`).

6.  **Run the Command:**  Construct the appropriate command based on your needs and run it.

**Example:**

To recover a deleted Word document named "ImportantReport.docx" from the C: drive to the E: drive using Regular mode, you would use the following command:

```cmd
winfr C: E: /regular /n ImportantReport.docx
```

To recover all DOCX files from the C: drive to the E: drive using Extensive mode, you would use the following command:

```cmd
winfr C: E: /extensive /y:docx
```

**Important Notes about Windows File Recovery:**

*   **Command-Line Only:**  Windows File Recovery is a command-line tool, so you need to be comfortable using the command prompt.
*   **NTFS Requirement:** Regular mode only works on NTFS drives.
*   **Destination Drive:** You *must* specify a different drive for the recovered files.
*   **Previewing Files:**  Windows File Recovery doesn't provide a preview of the files it recovers.  You'll need to open them to see if they're the correct ones.
*   **Complexity:** It has many options and can be complex to use effectively. Consult Microsoft's documentation for detailed instructions. (Search for "Windows File Recovery documentation").

## When These Methods Don't Work: Data Recovery Software

If the methods described above fail to recover your deleted files, it's likely that the data has been overwritten or the file system is too damaged. In these cases, dedicated data recovery software is your best option.

Examples of reputable data recovery software include:

*   **Recuva:**  A popular and user-friendly option, with a free version available.
*   **EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard:** A powerful recovery tool.
*   **Stellar Data Recovery:** Another robust option.

These programs use more advanced techniques to scan your hard drive and locate recoverable files, even if they've been partially overwritten. They often offer preview capabilities so you can see if the files are intact before you pay for recovery.

**Important Recommendations for Data Recovery:**

*   **Stop Using the Drive:**  The most crucial step is to stop using the drive where the files were deleted.  Any further activity on the drive could overwrite the data you're trying to recover.
*   **Use a Different Drive for Recovery:** Download and install the data recovery software on a *different* drive than the one you're trying to recover from.  Recover the files to a separate drive as well.
*   **Act Quickly:**  The sooner you start the recovery process, the higher your chances of success.

## Conclusion

Recovering deleted files using CMD tools like `attrib` and `chkdsk` is possible in certain situations, particularly when files have been hidden or the file system has minor errors. Windows File Recovery offers a more powerful (but complex) alternative. However, for more challenging cases, dedicated data recovery software provides the best chance of retrieving your lost data.  Remember to act quickly and stop using the affected drive to maximize your chances of a successful recovery. And of course, backing up your data regularly is the best way to prevent data loss in the first place!
