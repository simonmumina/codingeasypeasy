# How to Install Svelte: A Beginner-Friendly Guide (npm create svelte@latest)

Svelte is a radical approach to building user interfaces. While traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. This means your users download less code, resulting in faster load times and a smoother user experience.  If you're eager to dive into this exciting framework, this guide will walk you through installing Svelte using `npm create svelte@latest`.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** Svelte requires Node.js. You can download the latest version from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). It's highly recommended to use the LTS (Long Term Support) version.
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is usually installed automatically when you install Node.js. You can verify it by running `npm -v` in your terminal. If you don't have npm, you can install it separately.

## Installing Svelte with `npm create svelte@latest`

The recommended and easiest way to create a new Svelte project is by using the `npm create svelte@latest` command. This command will set up a new project with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.

**Step 1: Open your terminal**

Open your terminal or command prompt in the directory where you want to create your new Svelte project.

**Step 2: Run the `npm create svelte@latest` command**

Execute the following command:

```bash
npm create svelte@latest my-svelte-app
```

Replace `my-svelte-app` with your desired project name. This command downloads and runs the `create-svelte` package, which guides you through the initial project setup.

**Step 3: Project Configuration**

The `create-svelte` tool will prompt you with a series of questions to configure your new Svelte project:

*   **Which Svelte app template do you want to use?**

    You'll be presented with a few options:
    *   **Skeleton project:**  A minimal project with just the essential files and configurations.  This is great for starting from scratch and understanding the underlying structure.  We'll use this in this guide.
    *   **SvelteKit demo app:**  A more feature-rich demo application built with SvelteKit, Svelte's official application framework. This is a good choice for exploring more advanced features and best practices.

    For this tutorial, select **Skeleton project**. Navigate to it using arrow keys, and press `Enter`.

*   **Add TypeScript?**

    TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.

    *   **Yes, with JSDoc comments:**  Adds TypeScript support while keeping your JavaScript code almost identical, using JSDoc comments for type annotations.  A good option if you're transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript.
    *   **Yes, using TypeScript syntax:** Adds TypeScript support with full TypeScript syntax (`.ts` and `.svelte.ts` files).
    *   **No:** Skips TypeScript integration.

    For this tutorial, we will skip TypeScript for simplicity. Choose **No**.

*   **Add ESLint for code linting?**

    ESLint helps you identify and fix code style issues and potential errors.  It's highly recommended for maintaining code quality.

    *   **Yes:** Adds ESLint to your project.
    *   **No:** Skips ESLint integration.

    It's a good practice to use ESLint. Choose **Yes**.

*   **Add Prettier for code formatting?**

    Prettier automatically formats your code according to a consistent style guide.  This helps maintain code readability and consistency across your project.

    *   **Yes:** Adds Prettier to your project.
    *   **No:** Skips Prettier integration.

     It's a good practice to use Prettier. Choose **Yes**.

*   **Add Playwright for browser testing?**

    Playwright allows you to write end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions with your application. This is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of your application.

    *   **Yes:** Adds Playwright to your project.
    *   **No:** Skips Playwright integration.

    For this tutorial, we will skip Playwright for simplicity. Choose **No**.

*   **Add Vitest for unit testing?**

    Vitest is a fast and modern unit testing framework that integrates seamlessly with Svelte.

     *   **Yes:** Adds Vitest to your project.
     *   **No:** Skips Vitest integration.

    For this tutorial, we will skip Vitest for simplicity. Choose **No**.

The tool will then generate your project with the selected configurations.

**Step 4: Navigate to your project directory**

Once the project is created, navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd my-svelte-app
```

Replace `my-svelte-app` with the name you gave your project.

**Step 5: Install dependencies**

Although `create-svelte` initializes the project, you still need to install the project's dependencies. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command reads the `package.json` file in your project directory and installs all the necessary packages.

**Step 6: Run the development server**

Now that you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

This command starts a local development server and opens your Svelte application in your default web browser. You should see the default Svelte welcome page. The `-- --open` argument will automatically open the application in your browser.  If this doesn't work, you can manually navigate to the URL printed in the console (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

## Project Structure

Let's take a look at the basic structure of a Svelte project created with `npm create svelte@latest` using the "Skeleton project" template:

```
my-svelte-app/
├── .eslintrc.cjs         (If you chose to add ESLint)
├── .prettierignore       (If you chose to add Prettier)
├── jsconfig.json         (JavaScript configuration, may be tsconfig.json if typescript)
├── package.json          (Project dependencies and scripts)
├── svelte.config.js      (Svelte configuration)
├── src/
│   ├── App.svelte       (The main component of your application)
│   └── lib/
│       └── components/    (Directory for reusable components)
│   └── routes/
│        └── +page.svelte  (A basic page)
│   └── +layout.svelte (Layout)
│   └── app.html         (The HTML template for your application)
├── static/               (Static assets like images and fonts)
└── vite.config.js      (Vite configuration)
```

*   **`package.json`:**  Contains metadata about your project, including dependencies and scripts for running common tasks.
*   **`svelte.config.js`:**  Configures the Svelte compiler and preprocessors.
*   **`vite.config.js`:** Configures Vite, the build tool used by SvelteKit.
*   **`src/`:**  Contains your application's source code.
    *   **`App.svelte`:**  The root component of your application.  This is where your application's UI starts.
    *    **`routes/`:** Contains SvelteKit routes
        * **`+page.svelte`:** Default page Svelte component.
        * **`+layout.svelte`:** Parent layout for your page.
    *   **`app.html`:** Base html.
*   **`static/`:**  Holds static assets, such as images, fonts, and other files that don't need to be processed by the build tool.

## Modifying Your Svelte App

Let's make a simple change to the `App.svelte` component to see how Svelte works. Open `src/App.svelte` in your code editor.  You should see something like this:

```svelte
<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';

	let name = 'world';

	onMount(() => {
		console.log('Component mounted!');
	});
</script>

<main>
	<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
	<p>
		Visit <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">kit.svelte.dev</a> to learn more about SvelteKit
	</p>
</main>

<style>
	main {
		text-align: center;
		padding: 1em;
		max-width: 240px;
		margin: 0 auto;
	}

	h1 {
		color: #ff3e00;
		text-transform: uppercase;
		font-size: 4em;
		font-weight: 100;
	}

	@media (min-width: 640px) {
		main {
			max-width: none;
		}
	}
</style>
```

Let's change the value of the `name` variable and add some text to the paragraph. Modify the `App.svelte` file like this:

```svelte
<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';

	let name = 'Svelte!';

	onMount(() => {
		console.log('Component mounted!');
	});
</script>

<main>
	<h1>Hello {name}</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to your first Svelte app!  This is so exciting!  Visit <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">kit.svelte.dev</a> to learn more about SvelteKit
	</p>
</main>

<style>
	main {
		text-align: center;
		padding: 1em;
		max-width: 240px;
		margin: 0 auto;
	}

	h1 {
		color: #ff3e00;
		text-transform: uppercase;
		font-size: 4em;
		font-weight: 100;
	}

	@media (min-width: 640px) {
		main {
			max-width: none;
		}
	}
</style>
```

Save the file.  Your browser should automatically refresh, and you should see the changes reflected in the application.  This demonstrates the basic principles of Svelte's component structure and reactivity.
