# Understanding and Utilizing the TransitionEvent elapsedTime Property in JavaScript

CSS transitions are a powerful way to create smooth visual effects when the state of an element changes. JavaScript provides events that fire during and after a CSS transition, giving developers fine-grained control over animation timing and behaviour. One of the key properties available within these events is `elapsedTime`, found in the `TransitionEvent` object. This post will delve into the `elapsedTime` property, explaining its purpose, how it works, and providing practical examples of how to use it effectively in your web development projects.

## What is the `TransitionEvent`?

Before diving into `elapsedTime`, let's quickly recap the `TransitionEvent`. This event is fired during the CSS transition process. Three main events relate to transitions:

- **`transitionstart`**: Fired when a CSS transition has actually started.
- **`transitionend`**: Fired when a CSS transition has completed.
- **`transitioncancel`**: Fired when a CSS transition is cancelled, for instance, by applying another transition before the first one finishes.

These events provide information about the transition through the `TransitionEvent` object, allowing you to hook into the animation lifecycle and perform actions at specific points.

## Demystifying `elapsedTime`

The `elapsedTime` property of the `TransitionEvent` object represents the amount of time the transition has been running when the event fired. This value is returned in seconds. Importantly, it _doesn't_ measure the total duration of the transition, but rather the time passed since the transition _started_ before this specific event fired.

**Key characteristics of `elapsedTime`:**

- **Units:** Measured in seconds (e.g., `0.5` represents half a second).
- **Accuracy:** Relatively precise, but may have slight variations depending on browser performance.
- **Start Time:** It's relative to the _start_ of the transition, not the creation of the element or the setting of the transition property.
- **`transitionend` vs. `transitionstart`**: The value of `elapsedTime` in a `transitionend` event will typically be close to the transition's `transition-duration`, but not always exactly the same. Factors such as browser rendering delays and the nature of the transitioned property can cause slight differences.
- **Delayed Transitions:** If you specify a `transition-delay`, the `elapsedTime` will not include the delay period. It only starts counting when the transition _itself_ begins.

## Practical Examples with Code

Let's illustrate the use of `elapsedTime` with some practical JavaScript examples.

### Example 1: Logging the Elapsed Time

This example logs the elapsed time at the end of a simple transition.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

const TransitionExample = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const box = boxRef.current

    const handleTransitionEnd = (event) => {
      console.log(`Transition ended. Elapsed time: ${event.elapsedTime} seconds`)
      box.removeEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd) // Clean up the event listener
    }

    if (box) {
      box.addEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)

      // Trigger the transition
      box.classList.add('transitioned') // Assumes .transitioned class defines the transitioned state
    }

    return () => {
      if (box) {
        box.removeEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)
      }
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div
      ref={boxRef}
      style={{
        width: '100px',
        height: '100px',
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
        transition: 'width 0.5s ease-in-out',
        marginTop: '20px',
      }}
      className="box"
    />
  )
}

export default TransitionExample
```

```plaintext
/* Global Styles or in a CSS module */
.box.transitioned {
    width: 200px; /* Example of a property change */
}

```

In this example:

1.  We have a `div` with an initial width of 100px. The `transition` property is set to smoothly change the `width` over 0.5 seconds.
2.  When the component mounts and the `box` ref is available, we add the `.transitioned` class. This will make the `width` to change.
3.  An event listener is attached to the `transitionend` event.
4.  Inside the event handler, we log the `elapsedTime` property, demonstrating how to access it.
5.  The event listener is removed when the component unmounts or the transition ends (cleanup).

When the transition completes, the console will display something like: `Transition ended. Elapsed time: 0.502 seconds` (the exact value might vary slightly).

### Example 2: Using `elapsedTime` to Trigger a Subsequent Action

This example demonstrates using `elapsedTime` to trigger another action after a specific portion of the transition has completed.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'

const TransitionExample = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef(null)
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    const box = boxRef.current

    const handleTransitionEnd = (event) => {
      if (event.propertyName === 'width') {
        // Only react to the 'width' transition
        // Simulate a task that takes some time
        setTimeout(() => {
          setMessage(`Transition ended. Processed data after ${event.elapsedTime} seconds.`)
        }, 200) // Simulate processing time.
      }
      box.removeEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)
    }

    if (box) {
      box.addEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)
      box.classList.add('transitioned')
    }

    return () => {
      if (box) {
        box.removeEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)
      }
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        ref={boxRef}
        style={{
          width: '100px',
          height: '100px',
          backgroundColor: 'green',
          transition: 'width 0.5s ease-in-out',
        }}
        className="box"
      />
      <p>{message}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default TransitionExample
```

```plaintext
/* Global Styles or in a CSS module */
.box.transitioned {
    width: 300px; /* Example of a property change */
}

```

In this scenario:

1.  We listen for the `transitionend` event as before.
2.  We check `event.propertyName` to ensure we're reacting to the `width` transition.
3.  A `setTimeout` function simulates a task (e.g., data processing) that occurs _after_ the transition completes. We're using `elapsedTime` here simply for logging purposes to show when this action is happening relative to the original transition.
4.  The `setMessage` updates the component's state, displaying a message indicating the processing completion.

This is a common pattern in web development: using a transition to visually signal the completion of one task before initiating another.

### Example 3: Responding Based on a Specific `elapsedTime` Threshold

This example demonstrates using a threshold with `elapsedTime` for more granular control. This is particularly useful for complex animations involving multiple transitions and/or delays. Note: This is primarily for illustrative purposes since `transitionstart` would be a better event for this logic, however for more complex timing logic that can't be easily achieved with `transitionstart` this type of check becomes more valuable.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'

const TransitionExample = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef(null)
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    const box = boxRef.current

    const handleTransitionEnd = (event) => {
      if (event.elapsedTime > 0.4) {
        setMessage('Transition nearly complete!')
      } else {
        setMessage('Transition in progress...')
      }
      box.removeEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)
    }

    if (box) {
      box.addEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)
      box.classList.add('transitioned')
    }

    return () => {
      if (box) {
        box.removeEventListener('transitionend', handleTransitionEnd)
      }
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        ref={boxRef}
        style={{
          width: '100px',
          height: '100px',
          backgroundColor: 'purple',
          transition: 'width 0.5s ease-in-out',
        }}
        className="box"
      />
      <p>{message}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default TransitionExample
```

```plaintext
/* Global Styles or in a CSS module */
.box.transitioned {
    width: 250px; /* Example of a property change */
}

```

Here's what's happening:

1. We listen for the `transitionend` event as before.
2. Inside the event listener, we compare the `event.elapsedTime` to a threshold value (0.4 seconds in this example).
3. Based on the result of the comparison, we update the state of the `message` prop, allowing us to conditionally execute different actions.
4. We also check `event.propertyName` to ensure we're reacting to the `width` transition.

This technique allows you to create more complex, multi-stage animations or logic that triggers based on how far along a transition has progressed.

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common scenarios where the `elapsedTime` property can be valuable:

- **Coordinating Animations:** Synchronizing JavaScript animations with CSS transitions, ensuring they start and end at the right times.
- **Progress Indicators:** Updating a progress bar or other visual indicators as a transition progresses. While CSS can handle the animation of the progress bar, `elapsedTime` can be used to update text labels or other related information.
- **Delayed Actions:** Triggering additional effects or API calls after a certain amount of time has elapsed during a transition.
- **Creating Responsive Transitions:** Adjusting the speed or behaviour of a transition based on network conditions or other factors. You could, for instance, lengthen a transition's duration if a large image needs to load during the animation.
- **Debugging:** Logging the `elapsedTime` to diagnose performance issues or unexpected behaviour in your transitions.

## Considerations and Best Practices

- **Event Bubbling:** Be mindful of event bubbling. The `transitionend` event bubbles up the DOM tree, potentially triggering your handler multiple times if the transitioned element has children with their own transitions. Use `event.target` and `event.currentTarget` to ensure you're handling the correct element's transition. The `event.propertyName` is a reliable check that the correct property has triggered the event.
- **Performance:** Avoid overly complex calculations within your transition event handlers, as this can impact performance and cause jank in your animations.
- **Browser Compatibility:** `TransitionEvent` and its `elapsedTime` property are well-supported in modern browsers. However, always test your code across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent behaviour.
- **Alternative approaches:** Consider using `requestAnimationFrame` for more precise control over animations, especially when dealing with complex sequences. Libraries like GreenSock (GSAP) offer powerful animation tools and cross-browser compatibility.

## Conclusion

The `TransitionEvent`'s `elapsedTime` property offers a powerful way to interact with CSS transitions from JavaScript. By understanding how it works and applying it creatively, you can build more responsive, dynamic, and engaging user interfaces. Remember to consider the implications of event bubbling and performance, and to test your code thoroughly across different browsers. With careful planning and implementation, you can leverage `elapsedTime` to create truly exceptional web animations.
