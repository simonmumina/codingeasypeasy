# Sealed Classes in Kotlin: A Comprehensive Guide with Use Cases

Kotlin, a modern and concise programming language, offers several powerful features that enhance code clarity and maintainability. Among these, **sealed classes** stand out as a valuable tool for representing a limited set of types. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of sealed classes in Kotlin, explaining what they are, why they are beneficial, and when to use them with practical code examples.

## What are Sealed Classes in Kotlin?

A sealed class in Kotlin represents a restricted class hierarchy. Think of it as an `enum` on steroids. While an `enum` defines a limited set of named constants, a sealed class allows you to define a limited set of _subclasses_. All subclasses of a sealed class must be declared within the same file as the sealed class itself. This restriction enables the Kotlin compiler to know all possible subclasses at compile time, leading to significant benefits in terms of type safety and code maintainability.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Restricted Hierarchy:** All subclasses are known at compile time.
- **Type Safety:** Kotlin can infer all possible types within a `when` expression.
- **Exhaustive `when` Statements:** The compiler can ensure that `when` expressions cover all possible cases.
- **Single File Requirement:** All subclasses must be defined within the same file as the sealed class.
- **Abstract or Concrete:** A sealed class can be abstract, requiring its subclasses to provide implementations, or it can be concrete.

## Why Use Sealed Classes? Benefits and Advantages

Sealed classes offer several compelling advantages over traditional inheritance or other approaches for representing limited type hierarchies:

- **Enhanced Type Safety:** The compiler can guarantee that you've handled all possible subtypes in a `when` expression. This significantly reduces the risk of runtime errors due to unhandled cases.

- **Improved Code Readability:** Sealed classes clearly define the possible states or variations within a domain, making the code easier to understand and reason about.

- **Compile-Time Checks:** The compiler can perform checks to ensure that all necessary cases are handled, leading to fewer bugs and more reliable code.

- **Better Maintainability:** When you add a new subclass to a sealed class, the compiler will flag all `when` expressions that need to be updated to handle the new case. This makes it easier to maintain and evolve your code over time.

- **Expressive Data Modeling:** Sealed classes provide a natural way to model data that can be in one of a limited number of states, such as results of an operation, UI states, or events.

## When to Use Sealed Classes: Common Use Cases

Here are some common scenarios where sealed classes are particularly useful:

- **Representing Results of Operations:** Sealed classes can be used to represent the possible outcomes of an operation, such as success, failure, or loading.

- **Modeling UI States:** You can use sealed classes to define the different states of a UI, such as loading, displaying data, or showing an error message.

- **Handling Events:** Sealed classes are effective for representing different types of events in an application.

- **Modeling Algebraic Data Types (ADTs):** Sealed classes closely resemble ADTs found in functional programming languages, allowing you to define complex data structures with a limited set of variations.

## Code Examples

Let's explore some code examples to illustrate the use of sealed classes.

**1. Representing Results of an API Call:**

```plaintext
sealed class Result<out T> {
    data class Success<out T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error(val exception: Exception) : Result<Nothing>()
    object Loading : Result<Nothing>()
}

fun fetchData(): Result<String> {
    // Simulate API call
    return try {
        // Simulate successful API response
        Result.Success("Data from API")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Result.Error(e)
    }
}

fun processResult(result: Result<String>) {
    when (result) {
        is Result.Success -> println("Data: ${result.data}")
        is Result.Error -> println("Error: ${result.exception.message}")
        Result.Loading -> println("Loading...")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val apiResult = fetchData()
    processResult(apiResult)
}
```

In this example, the `Result` sealed class represents the possible outcomes of an API call: `Success`, `Error`, and `Loading`. The `processResult` function uses a `when` expression to handle each case, and the compiler ensures that all cases are covered. If you add a new subclass of `Result`, the compiler will force you to update the `processResult` function to handle it.

**2. Modeling UI States:**

```plaintext
sealed class UIState {
    object Loading : UIState()
    data class Content(val data: String) : UIState()
    data class Error(val message: String) : UIState()
}

fun renderUI(state: UIState) {
    when (state) {
        is UIState.Loading -> println("Displaying loading indicator...")
        is UIState.Content -> println("Displaying content: ${state.data}")
        is UIState.Error -> println("Displaying error message: ${state.message}")
    }
}

fun main() {
    renderUI(UIState.Loading)
    renderUI(UIState.Content("Some data"))
    renderUI(UIState.Error("An error occurred"))
}
```

Here, the `UIState` sealed class represents the different states of a UI. The `renderUI` function renders the UI based on the current state.

**3. Handling Events:**

```plaintext
sealed class Event {
    data class ButtonClick(val buttonId: Int) : Event()
    data class DataReceived(val data: String) : Event()
    object ScreenLoaded : Event()
}

fun handleEvent(event: Event) {
    when (event) {
        is Event.ButtonClick -> println("Button ${event.buttonId} clicked")
        is Event.DataReceived -> println("Data received: ${event.data}")
        Event.ScreenLoaded -> println("Screen loaded")
    }
}

fun main() {
    handleEvent(Event.ButtonClick(123))
    handleEvent(Event.DataReceived("Some data"))
    handleEvent(Event.ScreenLoaded)
}
```

In this example, the `Event` sealed class represents different types of events. The `handleEvent` function processes each event based on its type.

**4. Sealed Class with different data types:**

```plaintext
sealed class PaymentResult {
    data class Success(val transactionId: String) : PaymentResult()
    data class Failure(val errorCode: Int, val errorMessage: String) : PaymentResult()
    object Pending : PaymentResult()
}

fun processPayment(amount: Double): PaymentResult {
    // Simulate payment processing
    return if (amount > 0) {
        PaymentResult.Success("tx12345")
    } else {
        PaymentResult.Failure(101, "Invalid amount")
    }
}

fun handlePaymentResult(result: PaymentResult) {
    when (result) {
        is PaymentResult.Success -> println("Payment successful. Transaction ID: ${result.transactionId}")
        is PaymentResult.Failure -> println("Payment failed. Error code: ${result.errorCode}, Message: ${result.errorMessage}")
        PaymentResult.Pending -> println("Payment is pending...")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val paymentResult1 = processPayment(100.0)
    handlePaymentResult(paymentResult1)

    val paymentResult2 = processPayment(-10.0)
    handlePaymentResult(paymentResult2)

    val paymentResult3 = PaymentResult.Pending
    handlePaymentResult(paymentResult3)
}
```

## Conclusion

Sealed classes are a powerful tool in Kotlin for representing a limited set of types. They enhance type safety, improve code readability, and make your code more maintainable. By leveraging sealed classes, you can create more robust and expressive applications. Consider using sealed classes whenever you need to model data that can be in one of a limited number of states or when you want to ensure that all possible cases are handled in your code. They are particularly useful for representing results of operations, modeling UI states, and handling events. Understanding and utilizing sealed classes is a crucial step towards writing cleaner and more reliable Kotlin code.
