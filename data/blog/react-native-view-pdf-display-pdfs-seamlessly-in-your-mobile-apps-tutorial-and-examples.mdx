# React Native View PDF: Display PDFs Seamlessly in Your Mobile Apps (Tutorial & Examples)

PDFs are a ubiquitous file format for documents, and many mobile applications need to display them. Integrating PDF viewing functionality into your React Native app doesn't have to be complicated. `react-native-view-pdf` is a popular and powerful library that simplifies this process. This comprehensive guide will walk you through installation, usage, customization, and troubleshooting to help you seamlessly integrate PDF viewing into your React Native projects.

## What is `react-native-view-pdf`?

`react-native-view-pdf` is a React Native component that allows you to display PDF documents within your mobile application. It leverages native PDF rendering capabilities on both iOS and Android, ensuring optimal performance and a native look and feel. Key features include:

- **Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
- **Remote and Local PDF Support:** Load PDFs from a URL or from local files within your app's bundle or file system.
- **Zoom and Pan:** Provides intuitive zoom and pan gestures for easy document navigation.
- **Page Navigation:** Offers options for navigating between pages within the PDF.
- **Customizable Styling:** Allows for customization of the PDF viewer's appearance.
- **Event Handling:** Provides events to handle loading, error, and page change events.

## Installation

First, install the `react-native-view-pdf` package using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-view-pdf
# or
yarn add react-native-view-pdf
```

Next, you'll need to link the native dependencies. For React Native versions >= 0.60, autolinking should take care of this. However, for older versions or if you encounter issues, you might need to link manually.

**iOS:**

```plaintext
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

**Android:**

No manual linking is typically required for Android with autolinking.

## Basic Usage: Displaying a PDF from a URL

The most basic usage involves displaying a PDF from a URL. Here's a simple example:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions } from 'react-native'
import Pdf from 'react-native-view-pdf'

const MyPdfViewer = () => {
  const source = {
    uri: 'http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf', // Replace with your PDF URL
    cache: true,
  }
  // or, for a file system path:
  // const source = {uri:'bundle-assets://test.pdf'};
  //
  // or, for base64 data:
  // const source = {uri:'data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjcKJ...', base64:true};

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Pdf
        source={source}
        style={styles.pdf}
        onError={(error) => {
          console.log(error)
        }}
        onLoadComplete={(numberOfPages, filePath) => {
          console.log(`number of pages: ${numberOfPages}`)
        }}
        onPageChanged={(page, numberOfPages) => {
          console.log(`current page: ${page}`)
        }}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
  },
})

export default MyPdfViewer
```

**Explanation:**

- **`source` prop:** This is the most important prop. It tells the component where to find the PDF. It can be a:
  - `uri`: A URL to a remote PDF file. Set `cache: true` to cache the PDF locally.
  - `uri` (with `bundle-assets`): A path to a PDF file included in your app's bundle (e.g., within your `assets` folder).
  - `uri` (with `data:application/pdf;base64,...`): A base64 encoded PDF string. Set `base64: true`.
- **`style` prop:** This is crucial for sizing the PDF viewer. The example sets the width and height to the screen's dimensions, making it full-screen.
- **`onError` prop:** A function that gets called if there's an error loading the PDF. Use this to handle potential errors gracefully.
- **`onLoadComplete` prop:** A function that gets called after the PDF is successfully loaded. It provides the number of pages and file path.
- **`onPageChanged` prop:** A function that gets called when the user navigates to a different page. It provides the current page number and total number of pages.

## Displaying a Local PDF

To display a PDF from your app's bundle, you'll need to place the PDF file in your `assets` folder (or a similar directory) and then use the `bundle-assets://` scheme.

**Example:**

1.  **Place `my_document.pdf` in your `assets` folder.** The exact location depends on your project setup, but it's usually something like `android/app/src/main/assets` for Android and adding the file to your Xcode project for iOS.

2.  **Update the `source` prop:**

```plaintext
const source = { uri: 'bundle-assets://my_document.pdf' }
```

Remember to rebuild your app after adding the PDF file to ensure it's included in the bundle.

## Customization Options

`react-native-view-pdf` offers several customization options to tailor the PDF viewer to your app's design and functionality.

- **`trustAllCerts` (boolean):** If set to `true`, allows connections to servers with self-signed or untrusted certificates. Use with caution in production environments.

- **`password` (string):** If the PDF is password-protected, provide the password here.

- **`minScale` (number):** The minimum zoom scale allowed. Defaults to 1.0.

- **`maxScale` (number):** The maximum zoom scale allowed. Defaults to 3.0.

- **`horizontal` (boolean):** Set to `true` to enable horizontal scrolling. Defaults to `false` (vertical scrolling).

- **`enablePaging` (boolean):** Set to `true` to enable page-based scrolling. Each scroll operation moves to the next or previous page.

- **`fitPolicy` (enum):** Determines how the PDF is scaled to fit the view. Possible values:
  - `FitWidth`: Fits the PDF width to the view width.
  - `FitHeight`: Fits the PDF height to the view height.
  - `FitPage`: Fits the entire page within the view. (Default)

**Example with Customization:**

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions } from 'react-native'
import Pdf from 'react-native-view-pdf'

const MyCustomPdfViewer = () => {
  const source = {
    uri: 'http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf',
    cache: true,
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Pdf
        source={source}
        style={styles.pdf}
        minScale={0.5}
        maxScale={5.0}
        horizontal={true}
        enablePaging={true}
        fitPolicy="FitWidth"
        onError={(error) => {
          console.log(error)
        }}
        onLoadComplete={(numberOfPages, filePath) => {
          console.log(`number of pages: ${numberOfPages}`)
        }}
        onPageChanged={(page, numberOfPages) => {
          console.log(`current page: ${page}`)
        }}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
  },
})

export default MyCustomPdfViewer
```

In this example, the PDF viewer is configured to allow zooming between 0.5x and 5x, uses horizontal scrolling with paging enabled, and fits the PDF width to the view.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions you might encounter:

- **"Unable to resolve module `react-native-view-pdf`":** This usually means the package wasn't installed correctly or the native dependencies weren't linked. Double-check the installation steps and try running `react-native link react-native-view-pdf` (for older React Native versions). Ensure `pod install` has been executed in the `ios` directory.

- **PDF not displaying:**

  - **Incorrect `source`:** Verify that the URL or file path in the `source` prop is correct. For local files, make sure the file exists in the correct location within your app's bundle.
  - **Network issues:** If loading from a URL, check your internet connection and ensure the server is accessible.
  - **Permissions:** For Android, ensure you have the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission if you're trying to access PDFs from external storage.

- **Errors related to native dependencies:** If you're seeing errors related to native libraries, try cleaning your project and rebuilding it:

  **iOS:**

  - `cd ios`
  - `pod deintegrate`
  - `pod clean`
  - `pod install`
  - Rebuild your app in Xcode.

  **Android:**

  - `cd android`
  - `./gradlew clean`
  - Rebuild your app in Android Studio.

- **PDF renders blank/white screen:** This issue sometimes occurs when using `react-native-view-pdf` with Expo Go. As a workaround, try creating a development build of your app.

## Conclusion

`react-native-view-pdf` provides a straightforward and efficient way to display PDF documents in your React Native applications.
