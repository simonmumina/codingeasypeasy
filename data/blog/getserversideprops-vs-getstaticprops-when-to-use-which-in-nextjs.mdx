# getServerSideProps vs getStaticProps: When to Use Which in Next.js

Next.js offers powerful data fetching capabilities that can significantly impact your application's performance, SEO, and user experience. Two of the most important data fetching functions are `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`. Understanding the differences between them and knowing when to use each one is crucial for building efficient and scalable Next.js applications. This comprehensive guide will delve into the intricacies of these functions, providing clear explanations, practical examples, and valuable insights.

## Introduction: Why Data Fetching Matters in Next.js

Next.js is a React framework built for production. One of its key strengths is its ability to render pages in different ways, either on the server or during build time. This flexibility allows developers to choose the optimal data fetching strategy for each page, resulting in faster load times, better SEO, and an overall improved user experience.

Choosing the right data fetching method impacts:

*   **Performance:** How quickly your pages load and become interactive.
*   **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** How easily search engines can crawl and index your content.
*   **Data Freshness:** How up-to-date your data is.
*   **Server Load:** The resources required to serve your application.

## Understanding `getStaticProps`: Static Site Generation (SSG)

`getStaticProps` is a function you can export from a page. Next.js will then pre-render this page at **build time** using the data returned by `getStaticProps`. This means the HTML for the page is generated once during the build process and then served directly to users from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

**Key Characteristics of `getStaticProps`:**

*   **Pre-rendering at Build Time:** The page is generated only once, during the build process.
*   **Improved Performance:** Static pages are incredibly fast because they don't require any server-side computation for each request.
*   **Excellent SEO:** Search engine crawlers can easily access and index static content.
*   **Data Must Be Available at Build Time:** The data used to generate the page must be accessible during the build process.
*   **Ideal for Content that Doesn't Change Frequently:** Blog posts, landing pages, documentation, and e-commerce product pages (if the product catalog doesn't change too often) are good candidates.

**When to Use `getStaticProps`:**

Use `getStaticProps` when:

*   You can pre-render the page ahead of a user’s request.
*   The data required to render the page is available at build time.
*   The data doesn’t change frequently (or you can use incremental static regeneration).
*   You want to optimize for performance and SEO.

**Code Example: Fetching Blog Posts with `getStaticProps`**

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import { getAllPosts } from '../lib/posts';

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const allPosts = getAllPosts();
  return {
    props: {
      allPosts,
    },
  };
}

export default function Home({ allPosts }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {allPosts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <a href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

// lib/posts.js (Example of how you might fetch the posts)
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');

export function getAllPosts() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
  const allPostsData = fileNames.map((fileName) => {
    const slug = fileName.replace(/\.md$/, '');

    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

    return {
      slug,
      ...matterResult.data,
    };
  });

  return allPostsData;
}
```

In this example, `getStaticProps` fetches all blog posts from the `posts` directory during build time. The fetched data is then passed as props to the `Home` component, which renders the list of blog posts.  Because this is `getStaticProps`, the HTML for this page, and the list of blog posts, will be pre-rendered during the `next build` command.

**Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

If your data changes periodically, but not frequently enough to warrant server-side rendering, you can use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with `getStaticProps`.  ISR allows you to regenerate static pages in the background after a specified period.

To use ISR, add the `revalidate` key to the return object of `getStaticProps`:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const allPosts = getAllPosts();
  return {
    props: {
      allPosts,
    },
    revalidate: 60, // Regenerate the page every 60 seconds
  };
}
```

This tells Next.js to regenerate the page in the background every 60 seconds.  When a user requests the page after the initial build, they'll receive the cached version.  Next.js will then regenerate the page in the background, and subsequent requests will receive the updated version.

## Understanding `getServerSideProps`: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

`getServerSideProps` is another function you can export from a page. Unlike `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps` runs on **every request**. Next.js will pre-render the page on the server using the data returned by `getServerSideProps`.

**Key Characteristics of `getServerSideProps`:**

*   **Pre-rendering on Every Request:** The page is generated for each user request.
*   **Real-time Data:**  You can fetch and display data that is constantly changing or user-specific.
*   **Slower Performance Compared to SSG:**  Because the page is rendered on the server for each request, it can be slower than static site generation.
*   **Suitable for Personalized Content:** User dashboards, e-commerce checkout pages, and personalized content feeds are well-suited for `getServerSideProps`.

**When to Use `getServerSideProps`:**

Use `getServerSideProps` when:

*   You need to fetch data on every request.
*   You need access to the request object (e.g., for authentication, cookies, or headers).
*   Your data is highly dynamic and needs to be up-to-date on every page load.
*   SEO is less critical (since content might be personalized and harder for crawlers to index).

**Code Example: Fetching User Data with `getServerSideProps`**

```javascript
// pages/profile.js

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { req, res } = context;

  // Example: Get user ID from a cookie
  const userId = req.cookies.userId || null;

  if (!userId) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/login',
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  // Fetch user data based on the user ID
  const userData = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .catch(() => null);

  if (!userData) {
    return {
      notFound: true,
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {
      userData,
    },
  };
}

export default function Profile({ userData }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      <p>Name: {userData.name}</p>
      <p>Email: {userData.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `getServerSideProps` is used to fetch user data based on a user ID stored in a cookie.  The `context` object provides access to the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects, allowing you to read cookies or set headers. The page is rendered server-side on every request, ensuring that the user sees the most up-to-date information. Also note the usage of `redirect` and `notFound` within `getServerSideProps`. These are essential to handle cases where data is missing or unavailable.

## `getStaticPaths`:  Dynamic Routes with `getStaticProps`

When you have dynamic routes (e.g., `/posts/[slug]`), you need to use `getStaticPaths` along with `getStaticProps` to tell Next.js which paths should be pre-rendered at build time.

**Key Characteristics of `getStaticPaths`:**

*   **Defines Allowed Paths:** Specifies which dynamic routes should be pre-rendered.
*   **Used with Dynamic Routes and `getStaticProps`:** Required when you have dynamic route segments.
*   **Returns an Array of `paths` and a `fallback` Property:**
    *   `paths`: An array of objects, where each object defines a route to pre-render.
    *   `fallback`: Determines what happens when a user requests a path that wasn't pre-rendered.  It can be `false`, `true`, or `'blocking'`.

**`fallback` Options:**

*   `fallback: false`:  If a user requests a path that wasn't pre-rendered, they'll see a 404 error.
*   `fallback: true`:  Next.js will serve a fallback page (usually a loading state) while generating the page in the background. Once the page is generated, it will be cached and served on subsequent requests. This is suitable for content that is frequently updated.
*   `fallback: 'blocking'`:  Next.js will block the user request and wait for the page to be generated on the server. Once the page is generated, it will be cached and served on subsequent requests. This ensures the user always gets the full content, but can result in a slightly longer initial load time.

**Code Example:  Generating Blog Post Pages with `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`**

```javascript
// pages/posts/[slug].js
import { getPostBySlug, getAllPostSlugs } from '../../lib/posts';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = getAllPostSlugs().map((slug) => ({
    params: { slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false, // Or 'blocking' or true
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}

export default function Post({ post }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }} />
    </div>
  );
}

// lib/posts.js (Example of how you might fetch the posts)
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import { remark } from 'remark';
import html from 'remark-html';

const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');

export function getAllPostSlugs() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
  return fileNames.map((fileName) => fileName.replace(/\.md$/, ''));
}

export async function getPostBySlug(slug) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${slug}.md`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

  const matterResult = matter(fileContents);

  const processedContent = await remark()
    .use(html)
    .process(matterResult.content);
  const contentHtml = processedContent.toString();

  return {
    slug,
    content: contentHtml,
    ...matterResult.data,
  };
}
```

In this example:

1.  `getStaticPaths` fetches all post slugs and defines the allowed paths for the dynamic route `/posts/[slug]`.  `fallback: false` means that any requests to slugs not returned by `getAllPostSlugs` will result in a 404.

2.  `getStaticProps` fetches the content for a specific post based on the `slug` parameter.  The post content is then passed as a prop to the `Post` component.

## Choosing the Right Data Fetching Method: A Decision Tree

Here's a simplified decision tree to help you choose between `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`:

    A[Can you pre-render the page before a user's request?] --> B{Yes};
    A --> C{No};
    B --> D[Data available at build time?];
    D --> E{Yes};
    E --> F[Data changes frequently?];
    F --> G{Yes};
    F --> H{No};
    G --> I[Use getStaticProps with ISR (revalidate)];
    H --> J[Use getStaticProps];
    C --> K[Data needs to be updated on every request?];
    K --> L{Yes};
    K --> M{No};
    L --> N[Use getServerSideProps];
    M --> O[Consider client-side data fetching (useEffect) or a different approach];

    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style I fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style J fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style K fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style L fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

    style N fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style O fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Explanation of the Decision Tree:**

1.  **Can you pre-render the page before a user's request?** If yes, consider `getStaticProps`.
2.  **Data available at build time?** If yes, you can use `getStaticProps` directly.
3.  **Data changes frequently?** If yes, use `getStaticProps` with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) by setting the `revalidate` option.
4.  **If you can't pre-render the page:**
5.  **Data needs to be updated on every request?** If yes, use `getServerSideProps`.
6.  **If the data doesn't *need* to be updated on every request,** consider client-side data fetching using `useEffect` or explore alternative strategies such as storing data in cookies or localStorage and fetching it on the client.

## Performance Considerations

*   **`getStaticProps`:** Generally offers the best performance because pages are pre-rendered at build time and served directly from a CDN.
*   **`getServerSideProps`:** Can be slower than `getStaticProps` because pages are rendered on the server for each request. Minimize server-side processing and optimize database queries to improve performance.
*   **ISR:** A good compromise between static site generation and server-side rendering. It allows you to update static pages periodically without requiring a full rebuild.

## SEO Considerations

*   **`getStaticProps`:** Provides excellent SEO because search engine crawlers can easily access and index static content.
*   **`getServerSideProps`:** Can be less SEO-friendly if the content is highly personalized or changes frequently. Search engine crawlers may not be able to access all variations of the page.

## Best Practices

*   **Choose the right data fetching method for each page:**  Don't use `getServerSideProps` for pages that can be pre-rendered with `getStaticProps`.
*   **Optimize data fetching logic:** Minimize database queries and use caching to improve performance.
*   **Use ISR to update static pages periodically:** Keep your content fresh without sacrificing performance.
*   **Handle errors gracefully:** Provide informative error messages to users if data fetching fails.
*   **Consider client-side data fetching for specific components:** For components that require highly dynamic or user-specific data, client-side data fetching using `useEffect` might be a better option.
*   **Separate your data fetching logic:** Create reusable functions or libraries to fetch data from your API or database. This makes your code more maintainable and testable.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` is essential for building efficient and scalable Next.js applications. By carefully considering your data requirements, performance goals, and SEO considerations, you can choose the optimal data fetching strategy for each page, resulting in a better user experience and improved search engine rankings. Remember to leverage Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to keep your static content fresh and explore client-side data fetching for highly dynamic components. By following these guidelines, you can unlock the full potential of Next.js and create high-performing, SEO-friendly web applications.
