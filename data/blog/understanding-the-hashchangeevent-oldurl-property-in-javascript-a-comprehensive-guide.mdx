# Understanding the HashChangeEvent `oldURL` Property in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

The `HashChangeEvent` is a powerful tool in JavaScript for handling changes to the URL hash (the part after the `#` symbol). The `oldURL` property within the `HashChangeEvent` provides crucial information about the previous URL before the hash changed. This blog post provides a deep dive into the `HashChangeEvent`'s `oldURL` property, covering its purpose, syntax, browser compatibility, and practical examples.

## What is the `HashChangeEvent`?

Before diving into `oldURL`, let's understand the `HashChangeEvent` itself. This event fires when the fragment identifier (the part of the URL that follows the `#` symbol, including the `#`) of a URL has changed. It's particularly important in single-page applications (SPAs) where navigation often relies on updating the hash rather than performing full page reloads.

The `HashChangeEvent` provides information about both the old and new URLs, enabling developers to react to hash changes effectively.

## What is the `oldURL` Property?

The `oldURL` property of the `HashChangeEvent` interface contains a string representing the absolute URL of the document _before_ the hash was modified. This allows you to track where the user was coming from before the hash change occurred. It gives you a snapshot of the previous URL state.

### Syntax

The syntax for accessing the `oldURL` property within a `HashChangeEvent` listener is straightforward:

```plaintext
window.addEventListener("hashchange", (event) => {
  const previousURL = event.oldURL;
  console.log("Previous URL:", previousURL);
});
```

In this example, `event` represents the `HashChangeEvent` object, and `event.oldURL` provides the previous URL as a string.

## Browser Compatibility

The `HashChangeEvent` and therefore the `oldURL` property enjoy excellent browser support. It's supported by:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Opera
- Most mobile browsers

You can confidently use `HashChangeEvent` and `oldURL` in modern web applications without worrying too much about cross-browser compatibility issues. However, it's always a good practice to test your code in different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of how you can use the `oldURL` property in your JavaScript code.

### 1. Tracking User Navigation in a SPA

In a single-page application, you might want to track the user's navigation history using the hash. The `oldURL` property lets you know where the user was before moving to the current hash.

```plaintext
window.addEventListener("hashchange", (event) => {
  const previousURL = event.oldURL;
  const currentURL = event.newURL;

  console.log("Navigated from:", previousURL, "to:", currentURL);

  // Perform actions based on the navigation
  // For example, update UI elements, load data, etc.
});
```

In this example, we log both the `oldURL` and `newURL` to the console, providing a clear history of the user's navigation within the SPA. You can extend this by storing the navigation history in an array or by updating UI elements to reflect the user's path through the application.

### 2. Implementing a "Back" Button Functionality

While browsers provide a built-in "back" button, you might want to implement a custom one within your SPA. The `oldURL` property can help achieve this. Note: this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you'd likely manage a stack of URLs to handle more complex navigation.

```plaintext
let urlHistory = [];

window.addEventListener("hashchange", (event) => {
    const previousURL = event.oldURL;
    const currentURL = event.newURL;

    urlHistory.push(previousURL); // Store the previous URL

    console.log("Current History:", urlHistory);

    // Function to go back
    window.goBack = () => {
        if (urlHistory.length > 0) {
            const lastURL = urlHistory.pop();
            window.location.hash = new URL(lastURL).hash; // navigate to previous hash
            console.log('Going back to:', lastURL)
        } else {
            console.log("No more history to go back to.");
        }
    };

    // You'd have a button in your HTML with `onclick="goBack()"`
});
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **URL Parsing:** Using `new URL(url)` is a robust way to parse the `oldURL` string and extract the hash or other components if needed.
- **Managing History:** A simple array like `urlHistory` might suffice for simple scenarios. However, for more complex SPA navigation, consider using a proper routing library that handles history management more efficiently.
- **Security:** Be mindful of the URLs you are storing. Do not store sensitive information in the URL hash.

### 3. Performing Actions Based on Previous Location

The `oldURL` property allows you to trigger specific actions based on where the user _came from_. For example, you might want to display a different animation or load different data depending on the previous hash.

```plaintext
window.addEventListener("hashchange", (event) => {
  const previousURL = event.oldURL;
  const currentURL = event.newURL;

  if (previousURL.includes("#section1")) {
    console.log("User came from section 1, loading special data...");
    // Load specific data or trigger a specific animation
  } else if (previousURL.includes("#section2")) {
    console.log("User came from section 2, loading different data...");
    // Load different data or trigger a different animation
  } else {
    console.log("User came from an unknown location.");
  }
});
```

This example demonstrates how you can use conditional logic based on the `previousURL` to personalize the user experience or optimize data loading.

## Key Takeaways

- The `HashChangeEvent` is essential for handling hash changes in JavaScript, especially in SPAs.
- The `oldURL` property provides the URL _before_ the hash was modified, giving context about the user's previous location.
- It's widely supported across modern browsers.
- You can use it for tracking navigation, implementing custom "back" functionality (with caveats about history management), and performing actions based on the previous location.

## Common Pitfalls and Considerations

- **Empty `oldURL`:** If the hash change is the _first_ event to occur on a page, `oldURL` might be empty or `null`. Always check for this possibility before attempting to use it.
- **URL Encoding:** The `oldURL` property returns a URL that is properly encoded. Be sure to decode it appropriately if you need to access individual components.
- **Security:** Never store sensitive data in the URL hash. While the `oldURL` property can be helpful, be mindful of the information you are accessing and how you are using it.

## Conclusion

The `HashChangeEvent` and its `oldURL` property are valuable tools for building dynamic and responsive single-page applications. Understanding how to use `oldURL` allows you to track user navigation, implement custom navigation features, and tailor the user experience based on the previous URL. By using the examples and considerations outlined in this guide, you can effectively leverage the power of `HashChangeEvent` and `oldURL` in your web development projects.
