# Enable Hyper-V Using Command Prompt (CMD): A Comprehensive Guide

Hyper-V is Microsoft's virtualization platform that allows you to run multiple operating systems as virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical computer. This is incredibly useful for developers, IT professionals, and anyone who wants to test different operating systems or software configurations without needing multiple physical machines. While the GUI method is common, enabling Hyper-V via the command prompt (CMD) offers a faster and more scriptable approach, particularly useful for automated deployments or remote administration. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of how to enable Hyper-V using CMD.

## Prerequisites Before You Begin

Before diving into the command prompt, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Windows Edition:** You need a Windows 10 or Windows 11 version that supports Hyper-V. This typically includes Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education editions. Home editions generally do _not_ support Hyper-V.
- **Hardware Virtualization Support:** Your CPU must support hardware virtualization features like Intel VT-x or AMD-V. This feature also needs to be enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
- **Sufficient RAM:** While the minimum RAM requirement to install Hyper-V is technically lower, having at least 8GB of RAM is highly recommended for running VMs smoothly.
- **Administrative Privileges:** You need administrator rights on your Windows machine to enable Hyper-V.

### Checking for Hardware Virtualization Support

1.  **Task Manager:** The easiest way to check for hardware virtualization support is through the Task Manager.

    - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
    - Go to the "Performance" tab.
    - Select "CPU" on the left-hand side.
    - Look for "Virtualization" at the bottom right. It should say "Enabled".

    If it says "Disabled," you need to enable virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI settings.

2.  **System Information:** Another method involves using the `System Information` tool.
    - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog box.
    - Type `msinfo32` and press Enter.
    - In the System Summary, look for "Hyper-V - Virtualization Enabled in Firmware". A value of "Yes" indicates that virtualization is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.

### Enabling Virtualization in BIOS/UEFI

The process for enabling virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI varies depending on your motherboard manufacturer. However, here's a general outline:

1.  **Restart Your Computer:** Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup. This is usually done by pressing a key like `Delete`, `F2`, `F12`, or `Esc` during the boot process. The key to press is usually displayed briefly on the screen when your computer starts.
2.  **Locate Virtualization Settings:** Look for virtualization settings, often under headings like "CPU Configuration," "Advanced Settings," or "Performance Options." Common names for these settings include:
    - Intel VT-x (Intel Virtualization Technology)
    - AMD-V (AMD Virtualization)
    - SVM (Secure Virtual Machine)
3.  **Enable Virtualization:** Enable the relevant virtualization setting.
4.  **Save and Exit:** Save your changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI setup. Your computer will restart.

## Enabling Hyper-V via CMD: The DISM Command

The primary method for enabling Hyper-V via the command prompt uses the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool.

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:** It's crucial to open CMD with administrative privileges.

    - Search for "cmd" in the Windows search bar.
    - Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator."
    - Click "Yes" if prompted by User Account Control (UAC).

2.  **Execute the DISM Command:** Type or paste the following command into the command prompt window and press Enter:

    ```plaintext
    dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /all
    ```

    Let's break down this command:

    - `dism`: Invokes the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool.
    - `/online`: Specifies that you are working with the currently running operating system.
    - `/enable-feature`: Indicates that you want to enable a feature.
    - `/featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All`: Specifies the feature to enable, which is the complete Hyper-V platform.
    - `/all`: Enables all parent features and all sub-features associated with Hyper-V. This ensures that all necessary components are installed.

3.  **Wait for the Process to Complete:** DISM will now begin installing the Hyper-V components. This process can take several minutes, so be patient. You'll see progress messages displayed in the command prompt window.

4.  **Restart Your Computer:** Once the DISM command completes successfully, you will be prompted to restart your computer. Type `Y` to restart immediately, or `N` to restart later. **Restarting is crucial** for the changes to take effect.

    ```
    The operation completed successfully.
    Do you want to restart the computer to complete the operation? (Y/N)
    ```

## Verifying Hyper-V Installation

After restarting your computer, verify that Hyper-V has been successfully installed.

1.  **Search for Hyper-V Manager:**

    - Click the Windows Start button.
    - Type "Hyper-V Manager" in the search bar.
    - If Hyper-V is installed correctly, "Hyper-V Manager" will appear in the search results. Click on it to launch the application.

2.  **Check Windows Features:** You can also verify by checking Windows Features.
    - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog box.
    - Type `optionalfeatures.exe` and press Enter.
    - In the "Windows Features" dialog box, ensure that "Hyper-V" is checked.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter problems enabling Hyper-V using the CMD command, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- **Check for Errors in the DISM Output:** Carefully examine the output from the DISM command for any error messages. These messages can provide clues about the cause of the problem.

- **Ensure Hardware Virtualization is Enabled in BIOS/UEFI:** Double-check that hardware virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings, as described earlier. This is the most common reason why Hyper-V fails to install.

- **Conflicting Software:** Some security software or other virtualization solutions (like VMware Workstation or VirtualBox) might conflict with Hyper-V. Try disabling or uninstalling these programs temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.

- **Corrupted System Files:** In rare cases, corrupted system files can prevent Hyper-V from installing correctly. Run the System File Checker (SFC) tool to scan for and repair any corrupted system files.

  - Open Command Prompt as administrator.
  - Type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter.

- **Check the Event Viewer:** The Windows Event Viewer can provide more detailed information about errors related to Hyper-V installation. Look for events with the source "Hyper-V-VMMS" or related services.

## Example Script for Enabling Hyper-V

For automated deployments, you can create a simple batch script to enable Hyper-V. Save the following code as a `.bat` file (e.g., `enable-hyperv.bat`).

```plaintext
@echo off
echo Checking for administrative privileges...
net session >nul 2>&1
if %errorLevel% == 0 (
    echo Administrative privileges detected.
) else (
    echo This script requires administrative privileges. Please run as administrator.
    pause
    exit
)

echo Enabling Hyper-V...
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /all

echo Checking the return code...
if %errorLevel% EQU 0 (
    echo Hyper-V successfully enabled.
    echo A reboot is required to complete the installation.
    pause
    shutdown /r /t 0
) else (
    echo An error occurred while enabling Hyper-V.
    echo Please review the error messages above.
    pause
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `@echo off`: Disables command echoing.
- `net session >nul 2>&1`: Checks for administrative privileges.
- `if %errorLevel% == 0`: If the previous command succeeds (no error), it means the script is running as administrator.
- `dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /all`: Enables Hyper-V using DISM.
- `if %errorLevel% EQU 0`: Checks if the DISM command executed successfully.
- `shutdown /r /t 0`: Restarts the computer immediately.

**Running the Script:**

1.  Save the code as a `.bat` file (e.g., `enable-hyperv.bat`).
2.  Right-click the `.bat` file and select "Run as administrator."
