# Serving Multiple Web Apps with Different Base Directories on a Single Express Server

In web development, it's common to need to host multiple web applications on a single server. A clean and organized approach is to serve each application from its own base directory. This allows for better separation of concerns, easier maintenance, and a more structured deployment process. This blog post will guide you through the process of configuring an Express server to serve multiple web apps, each residing in its own directory.

## Why Use Multiple Base Directories?

Before diving into the implementation, let's consider the advantages of this approach:

- **Organization:** Each application's code and assets are neatly contained within its dedicated directory.
- **Maintainability:** Updates and modifications to one application don't directly impact others.
- **Scalability:** Easier to scale individual applications independently if needed.
- **Deployment:** Simplified deployment procedures for each application.
- **Version Control:** Clear separation for version control purposes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or Yarn:** Node Package Manager (npm) or Yarn is used for installing dependencies.
- **Basic Express.js Knowledge:** A basic understanding of Express.js is helpful.

## Setting Up the Project Structure

Let's start by creating a project directory and setting up the basic structure.

```plaintext
mkdir multi-app-server
cd multi-app-server
npm init -y  # or yarn init -y
mkdir app1 app2 public
touch index.js
```

This creates:

- `multi-app-server`: The root project directory.
- `app1`: Directory for the first web application.
- `app2`: Directory for the second web application.
- `public`: Directory for shared static assets.
- `index.js`: The main server file.

Now, add some basic HTML files to `app1` and `app2`:

**app1/index.html:**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>App 1</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to App 1!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple HTML page served from the 'app1' directory.</p>
  <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo">
</body>
</html>
```

**app2/index.html:**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>App 2</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to App 2!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple HTML page served from the 'app2' directory.</p>
  <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo">
</body>
</html>
```

Also, download a sample image (e.g., a PNG logo) and place it in the `public/images/` directory. If the `images` directory doesn't exist, create it. This will simulate shared assets that can be used by both applications.

## Installing Dependencies

Next, install the necessary dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install express --save  # or yarn add express
```

## Configuring the Express Server

Now, let's configure the Express server in `index.js` to serve both web applications from their respective base directories.

```plaintext
const express = require('express')
const path = require('path')
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

// Serve static files for App 1
app.use('/app1', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'app1')))

// Serve static files for App 2
app.use('/app2', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'app2')))

// Serve static files for shared assets in the 'public' directory
app.use('/images', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/images')))

// Optional: Redirect root to a specific app or a landing page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/app1') // Redirect to app1 by default
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'app1'))`:** This line tells Express to serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) from the `app1` directory. `path.join(__dirname, 'app1')` constructs the absolute path to the `app1` directory.
2.  **`app.use('/app1', ...)`:** This middleware mounts the static file serving at the `/app1` route. This means that any request to `/app1/*` will be served from the `app1` directory. For example, a request to `/app1/index.html` will serve the `index.html` file in the `app1` directory.
3.  **`app.use('/app2', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'app2')))`:** This does the same for the `app2` directory, making its content accessible under the `/app2` route.
4.  **`app.use('/images', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/images')))`:** This serves the images located in the `/public/images` directory, accessible via the `/images` route. This ensures that images in the html files can be accessed correctly.
5.  **`app.get('/', ...)`:** This handles requests to the root URL (`/`). In this example, it redirects to `/app1`, but you could modify this to serve a landing page or another specific app.
6.  **`app.listen(...)`:** Starts the Express server and listens for incoming connections on the specified port.

## Running the Server

Now, you can run the server using the following command:

```plaintext
node index.js
```

Open your web browser and navigate to:

- `http://localhost:3000/app1/` (or `http://localhost:3000/`) - This should display the content of `app1/index.html`.
- `http://localhost:3000/app2/` - This should display the content of `app2/index.html`.
- `http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png` - This should display the logo you placed in `public/images/`.

If you see the HTML pages for both applications, you've successfully configured the Express server to serve multiple web apps with different base directories.

## Advanced Configuration

Here are some advanced configurations you might consider:

### 1. Using Environment Variables for Port

It's a good practice to use environment variables for configuration, especially when deploying to different environments. Modify your `index.js` to use `process.env.PORT`:

```plaintext
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
```

Now you can set the port using the environment variable:

```plaintext
PORT=8080 node index.js
```

### 2. More Complex Routing

You can use more complex routing within each "app" directory. For example, within `app1`, you could have an `api` directory with API endpoints:

```
app1/
├── index.html
└── api/
    └── users.js
```

In your `index.js` file, you can route requests to `/app1/api/users` to `app1/api/users.js`:

```plaintext
// Serve static files for App 1
app.use('/app1', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'app1')))

// Define routes for App 1's API
app.use('/app1/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send("User data from App 1's API") // Replace with your actual API logic
})
```

### 3. Using a Router for Each App

For more complex applications, you might want to use an Express Router for each app to modularize the routing logic. Create separate router files for each app (e.g., `app1Router.js`, `app2Router.js`).

**app1Router.js:**

```plaintext
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
const path = require('path')

// Serve static files for App 1 within the router
router.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'app1')))

// Additional routes for App 1 can be defined here
router.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from App 1!')
})

module.exports = router
```

**index.js:**

```plaintext
const express = require('express')
const path = require('path')
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
const app1Router = require('./app1Router') // Import the router for App 1

// Mount the router for App 1 at the /app1 route
app.use('/app1', app1Router)

// Serve static files for App 2
app.use('/app2', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'app2')))

// Optional: Redirect root to a specific app or a landing page
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/app1') // Redirect to app1 by default
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

Remember to remove the `express.static` middleware for `app1` in `index.js` since it's now handled in the router.

### 4. Serving Different Ports

If you want each application to run on a different port on your local machine, you'd have to create separate Express apps and run them individually. This approach isn't serving multiple "apps" from a single _Express server instance_, but it's a related configuration that's useful for development.

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying your application to a production environment, consider the following:

- **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate Express server instances. This is crucial for load balancing, security, and SSL termination. The reverse proxy will listen on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) and direct requests to the appropriate Express server based on the URL path.
- **Process Manager:** Use a process manager like PM2 or Forever to ensure that your Express server stays running even if it crashes. These tools can automatically restart your application and provide monitoring capabilities.
- **Environment Variables:** Configure environment variables in your production environment to store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
- **Logging:** Implement robust logging to track errors and monitor the performance of your applications.
- **CDN:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static assets and improve loading times for users around the world.
