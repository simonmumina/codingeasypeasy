# Count Unique Documents in MongoDB with Node.js: A Comprehensive Guide

Understanding how to efficiently count unique documents within a MongoDB collection is a crucial skill for any Node.js developer working with data. This post provides a comprehensive guide to various techniques you can use to achieve this, along with detailed explanations and code examples, all optimized for performance and maintainability. We'll explore the `distinct` method and leverage the power of MongoDB's aggregation pipelines.

## Why Count Unique Documents?

Before diving into the code, let's understand why counting unique documents is important. Here are a few common use cases:

- **Data Analysis:** Understanding the distribution of unique values across your dataset.
- **Deduplication:** Identifying and potentially removing duplicate entries in your collection.
- **Reporting:** Generating reports that require accurate counts of distinct items.
- **Performance Optimization:** Identifying fields with high cardinality that might impact query performance.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB:** You need a running MongoDB instance, either locally or on a cloud platform like MongoDB Atlas. You can download MongoDB Community Edition from [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- **MongoDB Node.js Driver:** We'll be using the official MongoDB Node.js driver to interact with the database. Install it using npm:

  ```plaintext
  npm install mongodb
  ```

## Connecting to MongoDB

First, let's establish a connection to your MongoDB database. Create a file named `index.js` (or any name you prefer) and add the following code:

```plaintext
// index.js
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb')

// Replace with your MongoDB connection string
const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase'
const client = new MongoClient(uri)

async function main() {
  try {
    await client.connect()
    console.log('Connected successfully to server')

    const db = client.db('mydatabase') // Replace 'mydatabase' with your database name
    const collection = db.collection('mycollection') // Replace 'mycollection' with your collection name

    //  We will insert some sample data to the collection later
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e)
  } finally {
    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
    await client.close()
  }
}

main().catch(console.error)
```

Replace `"mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase"` with your actual MongoDB connection string. This string contains information about the host, port, database name, and authentication credentials (if any). Also, replace `mydatabase` and `mycollection` with appropriate names.

## Inserting Sample Data

To demonstrate the techniques, let's insert some sample documents into our collection:

```plaintext
// index.js (Inside the main function, before the counting logic)

// Insert some sample data
await collection.insertMany([
  { name: 'Alice', city: 'New York' },
  { name: 'Bob', city: 'London' },
  { name: 'Charlie', city: 'New York' },
  { name: 'David', city: 'Paris' },
  { name: 'Eve', city: 'London' },
  { name: 'Alice', city: 'New York' }, // Duplicate entry
])

console.log('Sample data inserted')
```

This code inserts six documents, with two having the same `name` and `city` values. We'll use this data to illustrate how to count unique documents based on these fields.

## Method 1: Using the `distinct()` Method

The `distinct()` method in MongoDB allows you to retrieve an array of distinct values for a specified field in a collection. To count the number of unique documents based on a single field, we can use the `distinct()` method and then determine the length of the resulting array.

```plaintext
// index.js (Inside the main function, after inserting the sample data)

// Count unique cities
const uniqueCities = await collection.distinct('city')
const uniqueCityCount = uniqueCities.length

console.log(`Number of unique cities: ${uniqueCityCount}`) // Output: 3 (New York, London, Paris)
```

This code retrieves an array of distinct values from the `city` field and then logs the number of elements in the array, which represents the number of unique cities.

**Counting Unique Combinations of Fields**

To count unique documents based on a combination of fields (e.g., `name` and `city`), you need to use the `distinct` method along with an aggregation pipeline. This is because the `distinct` method only works on a single field directly.

```plaintext
// index.js (Inside the main function, after the unique city count)
// Count unique combinations of name and city using distinct within an aggregation pipeline

const uniqueCombinations = await collection
  .aggregate([
    {
      $group: {
        _id: { name: '$name', city: '$city' },
      },
    },
    {
      $count: 'totalUniqueCombinations',
    },
  ])
  .toArray()

const uniqueCombinationCount =
  uniqueCombinations.length > 0 ? uniqueCombinations[0].totalUniqueCombinations : 0

console.log(`Number of unique combinations of name and city: ${uniqueCombinationCount}`) // Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`$group` Stage:** The `$group` stage groups the documents based on the combined values of `name` and `city`. The `_id` field is a composite key that contains both the `name` and `city`. This effectively identifies the unique combinations.

2.  **`$count` Stage:** The `$count` stage counts the number of groups created in the previous stage. The result is stored in a field named "totalUniqueCombinations". If no documents match the query, the array returned from the aggregate function will be empty. Therefore the conditional is used to default to 0.

## Method 2: Using Aggregation Pipelines for Complex Scenarios

Aggregation pipelines provide a more powerful and flexible way to count unique documents, especially when dealing with complex filtering, transformations, or calculations. Here's an example using an aggregation pipeline to count unique documents based on the `name` and `city` fields:

```plaintext
// index.js (Inside the main function, after the unique combination count)
// Count unique combinations of name and city using an aggregation pipeline
const uniqueCount = await collection
  .aggregate([
    {
      $group: {
        _id: { name: '$name', city: '$city' },
        count: { $sum: 1 }, // Count occurrences of each combination
      },
    },
    {
      $match: { count: { $gt: 0 } }, // filter those groups with count > 0
    },
    {
      $count: 'totalUniqueDocuments', // Count the number of distinct combinations
    },
  ])
  .toArray()

const totalUniqueDocuments = uniqueCount.length > 0 ? uniqueCount[0].totalUniqueDocuments : 0

console.log(`Number of total unique documents based on name and city: ${totalUniqueDocuments}`) // Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`$group` Stage:** This stage groups the documents based on the combined values of `name` and `city`. The `_id` field is a composite key that contains both the `name` and `city`. The `$sum: 1` expression counts the occurrences of each unique combination.

2.  **`$match` Stage (Optional):** This stage is actually not needed because count can never be less than 1 in the output of `$group`. However, it can be used for other filters, that are not always related to count.

3.  **`$count` Stage:** This stage counts the number of groups created in the previous stage. The result is stored in a field named "totalUniqueDocuments". If no documents match the query, the array returned from the aggregate function will be empty. Therefore the conditional is used to default to 0.

## Performance Considerations

- **`distinct()`:** The `distinct()` method can be efficient for simple cases with a single field. However, it may not perform well on large collections or when dealing with complex queries. It also loads all distinct values into memory, which can be a problem for very large result sets.

- **Aggregation Pipelines:** Aggregation pipelines offer more flexibility and often better performance for complex scenarios. MongoDB can optimize aggregation pipelines by using indexes and performing operations in stages.

- **Indexes:** Create indexes on the fields you're using for grouping or filtering. Indexes can significantly improve the performance of both `distinct()` and aggregation pipelines. For example, to create an index on the `name` and `city` fields:

  ```plaintext
  // index.js (after getting collection but before any counting operations)
  await collection.createIndex({ name: 1, city: 1 }) // Create a compound index
  ```

## Choosing the Right Method

- For simple cases where you need to count unique values for a single field, the `distinct()` method might be sufficient.

- For more complex scenarios involving multiple fields, filtering, or calculations, aggregation pipelines are generally the better choice. They offer greater flexibility and potentially better performance, especially with proper indexing.

## Complete Code Example (index.js)

```plaintext
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb')

// Replace with your MongoDB connection string
const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase'
const client = new MongoClient(uri)

async function main() {
  try {
    await client.connect()
    console.log('Connected successfully to server')

    const db = client.db('mydatabase') // Replace 'mydatabase' with your database name
    const collection = db.collection('mycollection') // Replace 'mycollection' with your collection name

    // Create index for name and city
    await collection.createIndex({ name: 1, city: 1 })

    // Insert some sample data
    await collection.insertMany([
      { name: 'Alice', city: 'New York' },
      { name: 'Bob', city: 'London' },
      { name: 'Charlie', city: 'New York' },
      { name: 'David', city: 'Paris' },
      { name: 'Eve', city: 'London' },
      { name: 'Alice', city: 'New York' }, // Duplicate entry
    ])

    console.log('Sample data inserted')

    // Count unique cities
    const uniqueCities = await collection.distinct('city')
    const uniqueCityCount = uniqueCities.length

    console.log(`Number of unique cities: ${uniqueCityCount}`)

    // Count unique combinations of name and city using distinct within an aggregation pipeline
    const uniqueCombinations = await collection
      .aggregate([
        {
          $group: {
            _id: { name: '$name', city: '$city' },
          },
        },
        {
          $count: 'totalUniqueCombinations',
        },
      ])
      .toArray()

    const uniqueCombinationCount =
      uniqueCombinations.length > 0 ? uniqueCombinations[0].totalUniqueCombinations : 0

    console.log(
      `Number of unique combinations of name and city using distinct: ${uniqueCombinationCount}`
    )

    // Count unique combinations of name and city using an aggregation pipeline
    const uniqueCount = await collection
      .aggregate([
        {
          $group: {
            _id: { name: '$name', city: '$city' },
            count: { $sum: 1 }, // Count occurrences of each combination
          },
        },
        {
          $match: { count: { $gt: 0 } }, // filter those groups with count > 0
        },
        {
          $count: 'totalUniqueDocuments', // Count the number of distinct combinations
        },
      ])
      .toArray()

    const totalUniqueDocuments = uniqueCount.length > 0 ? uniqueCount[0].totalUniqueDocuments : 0

    console.log(
      `Number of total unique documents based on name and city using aggregation pipeline: ${totalUniqueDocuments}`
    )
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e)
  } finally {
    // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
    await client.close()
  }
}

main().catch(console.error)
```
