# Run Spring Boot with Docker: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

In today's software development landscape, containerization has become a critical practice for building, deploying, and managing applications. Docker, a leading containerization platform, allows you to package your applications and their dependencies into standardized units called containers. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and ensures consistent behavior across different environments. This post explores how to run Spring Boot applications with Docker, providing a detailed, step-by-step guide with code examples.

## Why Dockerize Spring Boot Applications?

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand the benefits of using Docker with Spring Boot:

- **Consistency:** Docker containers guarantee consistent execution across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Portability:** Containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, enabling seamless deployment across different infrastructures.
- **Isolation:** Each container runs in isolation, preventing conflicts between applications and their dependencies.
- **Scalability:** Docker simplifies scaling your Spring Boot applications by allowing you to easily create and manage multiple containers.
- **Reproducibility:** Docker images capture the exact state of your application and its dependencies, making deployments reproducible.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Docker simplifies deployment processes, as you only need to deploy the Docker image, not configure the entire environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher. (Recommended: JDK 17 or JDK 21)
- **Maven or Gradle:** Build tool for managing dependencies and building the application.
- **Docker:** Docker Desktop or Docker Engine installed and running.
- **An IDE:** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code) - Optional, but highly recommended.

## Step 1: Create a Simple Spring Boot Application

Let's create a simple Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr. Visit [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/) and configure your project:

- **Project:** Maven or Gradle
- **Language:** Java
- **Spring Boot:** Choose a stable version (e.g., 3.2.0)
- **Group:** com.example
- **Artifact:** springboot-docker
- **Packaging:** Jar
- **Java:** 17 or 21 (match your installed JDK)
- **Dependencies:** Spring Web

Click "Generate" to download the project. Extract the archive and open the project in your IDE.

Create a simple REST controller in the `src/main/java/com/example/springbootdocker` directory:

```plaintext
// src/main/java/com/example/springbootdocker/HelloController.java
package com.example.springbootdocker;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Spring Boot in Docker!";
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Now, let's create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your Spring Boot project. The Dockerfile contains instructions for building the Docker image.

```dockerfile
# Use a base image with a Java runtime environment (JRE)
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-focal as builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Maven or Gradle project files
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src

# Build the application using Maven or Gradle
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests  # For Maven
# RUN ./gradlew build -x test  # For Gradle

# Stage 2: Create a lean runtime image
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-focal

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built JAR file from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose the port the application runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

**Explanation:**

- **`FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-focal as builder`**: Specifies the base image. `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-focal` provides a Java 17 runtime environment based on Eclipse Temurin and Ubuntu Focal. The `as builder` creates a stage named "builder" which we will use later. Consider using the Alpine base image for smaller image sizes (e.g., `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine`), but be aware of potential compatibility issues.
- **`WORKDIR /app`**: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
- **`COPY pom.xml .` and `COPY src ./src`**: Copies the `pom.xml` file (Maven) and the source code directory into the container. For Gradle, you would copy `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` and the source directories.
- **`RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests`**: Builds the Spring Boot application using Maven. `-DskipTests` skips the unit tests during the build process. For Gradle, you would use `./gradlew build -x test`. We are using the Maven Wrapper (`./mvnw`) which is bundled with the Spring Initializr project. This ensures that the build uses the correct Maven version.
- **`FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-focal`**: Starts a new stage with a fresh base image for the runtime environment. This is important for creating a smaller, more secure image.
- **`COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar`**: Copies the built JAR file from the `builder` stage (where the application was compiled) into the current stage. This optimizes the image by only including the necessary compiled application files.
- **`EXPOSE 8080`**: Exposes port 8080 to the outside world. This is the default port Spring Boot uses.
- **`ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]`**: Defines the command to execute when the container starts. This tells Docker to run the Spring Boot application using the `java -jar` command.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Multi-Stage Builds:** The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build. This is a best practice for creating smaller and more efficient Docker images. The first stage builds the application, and the second stage only includes the necessary runtime components.
- **Base Image Choice:** Choosing the right base image is crucial. Consider using a lightweight base image like Alpine to reduce the image size. However, ensure that it includes all the necessary dependencies for your application. Eclipse Temurin provides reliable and well-maintained JDK images.
- **Maven/Gradle Wrapper:** Using the Maven or Gradle wrapper (included in projects generated by Spring Initializr) ensures that your build uses the correct version of Maven or Gradle, regardless of what's installed on the host system.

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Open a terminal in the root directory of your Spring Boot project (the same directory as the `Dockerfile`) and execute the following command to build the Docker image:

```plaintext
docker build -t springboot-docker .
```

**Explanation:**

- **`docker build`**: The command to build a Docker image.
- **`-t springboot-docker`**: Tags the image with the name `springboot-docker`. You can choose a different name if you prefer. It's a good practice to use lowercase names and avoid special characters. A more descriptive name might be `your-dockerhub-username/springboot-docker`.
- **`.`**: Specifies the build context as the current directory. Docker will look for the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

Docker will execute the instructions in the `Dockerfile` and create the image. You'll see output indicating the progress of the build.

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

After the image is built, run it using the following command:

```plaintext
docker run -p 8080:8080 springboot-docker
```

**Explanation:**

- **`docker run`**: The command to run a Docker container.
- **`-p 8080:8080`**: Maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 8080 inside the container. This allows you to access the application running inside the container from your browser or other tools. You can change the host port if needed (e.g., `-p 9000:8080` would map host port 9000 to container port 8080).
- **`springboot-docker`**: Specifies the name of the Docker image to run.

The Spring Boot application will start inside the Docker container. You can now access it by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the "Hello from Spring Boot in Docker!" message.

## Step 5: Docker Compose (Optional, but Recommended for Complex Applications)

For more complex applications with multiple services, Docker Compose is a powerful tool for defining and managing multi-container applications.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project:

```plaintext
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: springboot-docker
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    restart: always
```

**Explanation:**

- **`version: "3.8"`**: Specifies the Docker Compose file version.
- **`services`**: Defines the services that make up your application.
- **`web`**: The name of the service (you can choose any name).
- **`image: springboot-docker`**: Specifies the Docker image to use for this service.
- **`ports: - "8080:8080"`**: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container.
- **`restart: always`**: Automatically restarts the container if it fails.

To start the application using Docker Compose, run the following command in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```plaintext
docker-compose up -d
```

**Explanation:**

- **`docker-compose up`**: Starts the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **`-d`**: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

To stop the application:

```plaintext
docker-compose down
```

Docker Compose is particularly useful when your Spring Boot application interacts with other services, such as databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka), or caching systems (e.g., Redis). You can define these services in the `docker-compose.yml` file and manage them together with your Spring Boot application.

## Step 6: Optimizing Your Docker Image

Here are some tips for optimizing your Docker image size and build process:

- **Use Multi-Stage Builds:** As demonstrated in the Dockerfile above, multi-stage builds significantly reduce the final image size by only including the necessary runtime components.
- **Choose a Lightweight Base Image:** Consider using Alpine Linux-based images (e.g., `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine`) for smaller image sizes. However, be aware of potential compatibility issues with some libraries.
- **Use `.dockerignore`:** Create a `.dockerignore` file in the root directory of your project to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the Docker image. This can include IDE configuration files, build artifacts, and other files that are not required to run the application. Example contents of `.dockerignore`:

```
.idea
.mvn
target
logs
```

- **Minimize Layers:** Reduce the number of layers in your Docker image by combining multiple `RUN` commands into a single command. This optimizes the image size. For example, instead of:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y some-package
```

Use:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y some-package
```

- **Use Official Images:** Leverage official Docker images for commonly used software components (e.g., databases, message queues). These images are typically well-maintained and optimized for Docker.
