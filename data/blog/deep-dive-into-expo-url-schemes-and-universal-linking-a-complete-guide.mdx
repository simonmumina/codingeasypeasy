# Deep Dive into Expo URL Schemes and Universal Linking: A Complete Guide

This comprehensive guide explores the world of URL schemes and universal linking within the Expo React Native ecosystem. We'll cover everything from the fundamental concepts to practical implementation, enabling you to seamlessly integrate deep linking functionality into your Expo applications. Whether you're looking to launch your app directly from a web link, email, or another app, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and code examples you need to succeed.

## What are URL Schemes and Universal Linking?

Before diving into the specifics of Expo, let's understand the core concepts of URL schemes and universal linking:

- **URL Schemes:** Imagine a unique address for your app. A URL scheme acts as that address. It allows other applications or websites to launch your app directly by using a custom prefix (e.g., `myapp://`). While simple to implement, URL schemes have limitations, particularly regarding claim ownership and security.

- **Universal Linking (aka App Links on Android):** A more secure and robust method for deep linking. Instead of using a custom URL scheme, Universal Linking uses standard HTTP/HTTPS URLs. The operating system verifies that you own the domain associated with the link, providing a safer and more reliable deep linking experience. This eliminates the potential for conflicts with other apps using the same URL scheme.

## Why Use URL Schemes and Universal Linking in Your Expo App?

Implementing URL schemes and universal linking offers significant benefits for your Expo application:

- **Improved User Experience:** Provide a seamless transition from websites, emails, or other apps directly into specific sections of your application.
- **Enhanced Marketing Campaigns:** Track the effectiveness of your marketing efforts by directing users to particular screens within your app based on ad clicks or referral links.
- **Simplified Sharing:** Enable users to easily share content from your app with a link that directly opens the content within the app for recipients.
- **Better User Onboarding:** Direct new users to specific tutorials or setup flows within your app based on referral links or onboarding emails.

## Setting Up URL Schemes in Your Expo App

### 1. Configure `app.json` (or `app.config.js`)

The primary step involves configuring your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file to define your URL scheme.

```plaintext
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyAwesomeApp",
    "slug": "my-awesome-app",
    "scheme": "myawesomeapp"  // <--- Your unique URL scheme
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`scheme`**: This is where you define your URL scheme. Choose a unique identifier, ideally based on your app's name. It should be lowercase and avoid special characters. In this example, we're using `myawesomeapp`.

**Important:** After modifying your `app.json`, rebuild your Expo app (either using Expo Go or by creating a new build).

### 2. Handling the URL in Your App

Now that you've configured your URL scheme, you need to handle incoming URLs within your React Native code. Expo provides the `Linking` API for this purpose.

```plaintext
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Linking, Text, View } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleDeepLink = (event) => {
      const { url } = event
      if (url) {
        // Process the URL here
        console.log('Deep link URL:', url)
        // Extract parameters from the URL and navigate accordingly
        const route = url.replace('myawesomeapp://', '') // Remove the scheme
        // Implement your navigation logic based on the 'route'
        alert(`Navigating to: ${route}`) // Example: navigate to a specific screen
      }
    }

    Linking.addEventListener('url', handleDeepLink)

    Linking.getInitialURL()
      .then((url) => {
        if (url) {
          handleDeepLink({ url })
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => console.error('An error occurred', err))

    return () => {
      Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleDeepLink)
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`Linking.addEventListener('url', handleDeepLink)`**: This sets up a listener that fires whenever the app is opened via a URL scheme. The `handleDeepLink` function will be executed with the URL as an argument.
- **`Linking.getInitialURL()`**: This gets the URL that opened the app if it was launched from a URL scheme. This is essential for handling the initial launch.
- **`handleDeepLink(event)`**: This function extracts the URL from the event and performs the necessary actions. In this example, we log the URL to the console and display an alert. **Crucially, this is where you'll implement your app's navigation logic.** You'll typically parse the URL, extract parameters, and navigate to the corresponding screen or component within your app.
- **`url.replace('myawesomeapp://', '')`**: This line removes the URL scheme prefix, leaving you with the path and any parameters. For instance, if the URL is `myawesomeapp://profile?userId=123`, `route` will be `profile?userId=123`.

**Testing Your URL Scheme:**

- **iOS Simulator:** Use the `xcrun simctl openurl booted <your_url>` command in your terminal. For example: `xcrun simctl openurl booted myawesomeapp://profile?userId=123`
- **Android Emulator:** Use the `adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d <your_url> <your_package_name>` command. You'll need to find your app's package name (it's in your `app.json` under `android.package`). For example: `adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "myawesomeapp://profile?userId=123" com.example.myawesomeapp`

## Implementing Universal Linking (App Links)

Universal Linking provides a more secure and robust method for deep linking. It uses standard HTTPS URLs instead of custom URL schemes.

### 1. Configure Your Website

The first step is to configure your website to serve a special file called `apple-app-site-association` (for iOS) and to handle intent filters in your Android manifest file.

**a. `apple-app-site-association` (iOS):**

- Create a file named `apple-app-site-association` (without any file extension) and place it in the `.well-known` directory of your website (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`). **This file MUST be served over HTTPS.**

- The file should contain JSON that describes which paths on your website should be associated with your app. Here's an example:

  ```plaintext
  {
    "applinks": {
      "apps": [],
      "details": [
        {
          "appID": "YOUR_TEAM_ID.com.example.myawesomeapp", // Replace with your app's Team ID and Bundle Identifier
          "paths": [ "/profile/*", "/content/*", "/promo" ] // Paths that should open your app
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - **`appID`**: This is your app's _Team ID_ followed by a dot (`.`) and your app's _Bundle Identifier_. You can find your Team ID and Bundle Identifier in your Apple Developer account.
  - **`paths`**: An array of URL paths on your website that should be associated with your app. You can use wildcards (`*`) to match multiple paths. For example, `/profile/*` will match any URL starting with `/profile/`. `/promo` will match the exact path `/promo`.

**b. Android App Links:**

- **Verify Ownership in `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Add an intent filter to your main activity in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file (located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` in your Expo project - you'll likely need to eject or prebuild to access this file). The intent filter declares your app's association with your website domain.

  ```xml
  <activity
      android:name=".MainActivity"
      android:label="@string/app_name"
      android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|uiMode"
      android:launchMode="singleTask"
      android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"
      android:exported="true">  <!-- Make sure exported is true -->
    <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
      </intent-filter>
      <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
          <data android:scheme="https" android:host="yourdomain.com" android:pathPrefix="/profile" />
          <data android:scheme="https" android:host="yourdomain.com" android:pathPrefix="/content" />
          <data android:scheme="https" android:host="yourdomain.com" android:pathPrefix="/promo" />
      </intent-filter>
  </activity>
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - **`android:autoVerify="true"`**: This tells Android to automatically verify the association between your app and your website using the Digital Asset Links verification process.
  - **`<data>` elements**: Each `<data>` element specifies a scheme (`https`), a host (`yourdomain.com`), and an optional path prefix (`/profile`, `/content`, `/promo`). **Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.** These elements define which URLs should open your app. You'll need one `<data>` element for each path prefix you want to support.

- **Digital Asset Links Verification**: Android uses Digital Asset Links to verify your ownership of the website. This process involves serving a `assetlinks.json` file from the `.well-known` directory of your website (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`). _However, with `autoVerify="true"`, Android usually handles this automatically._ You typically don't need to create this file manually unless you are facing verification issues. If you do need it, refer to the Android documentation on Digital Asset Links.

### 2. Configure `app.json` for Universal Linking

You also need to update your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) to support Universal Linking.

```plaintext
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyAwesomeApp",
    "slug": "my-awesome-app",
    "scheme": "myawesomeapp", // Keep your URL scheme
    "ios": {
      "associatedDomains": [
        "applinks:yourdomain.com" // Replace with your domain
      ],
       "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myawesomeapp" // Replace with your bundle identifier

    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.myawesomeapp",  //Replace with your package name
      "intentFilters": [
        {
          "action": "android.intent.action.VIEW",
          "data": [
            {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "yourdomain.com",
              "pathPrefix": "/profile"
            },
             {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "yourdomain.com",
              "pathPrefix": "/content"
            },
            {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "yourdomain.com",
              "pathPrefix": "/promo"
            }
          ],
          "category": [
            "android.intent.category.DEFAULT",
            "android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ios.associatedDomains`**: An array of associated domains for your iOS app. Use the `applinks:` prefix followed by your domain.
- **`android.intentFilters`**: This replicates the intent filters you added to your `AndroidManifest.xml` but allows Expo to manage them during the build process. **The `intentFilters` array in `app.json` will _override_ anything defined in your `AndroidManifest.xml` for this specific intent filter.** You might want to avoid defining intentFilters here if you have complex configurations in `AndroidManifest.xml`, and just handle those in your native code, and use eject to prevent this from being overwritten on a build.
- **`bundleIdentifier`**: Ensure you have a valid and unique bundle identifier for your iOS application.
- **`package`**: The package name for your Android application.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Prebuild or Eject**: For Android App Links, especially if you need to modify the `AndroidManifest.xml` directly, you will need to either prebuild your Expo project (`expo prebuild`) or eject (`expo eject`). Prebuilding allows you to access and modify native files while still benefiting from Expo's managed workflow. Ejecting gives you full control but removes Expo's managed workflow benefits.
- **Domain Verification**: It may take some time for iOS and Android to verify the association between your app and your website. You can check the status of the verification using the Apple System Logs (for iOS) or the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) logs.
- **Hosting `apple-app-site-association`**: Double-check that your web server is serving the `apple-app-site-association` file correctly with the correct MIME type. It should be served as `application/json` or `text/plain`. Incorrect MIME type is a common cause of universal linking failures on iOS.

### 3. Handling the Universal Link in Your App

The code for handling Universal Links within your React Native app is almost identical to the URL scheme handling code. You'll use the `Linking` API to listen for incoming URLs.

```plaintext
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Linking, Text, View } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleDeepLink = (event) => {
      const { url } = event
      if (url) {
        // Process the URL here
        console.log('Deep link URL:', url)
        // Extract parameters from the URL and navigate accordingly
        // Universal Links will start with 'https://' instead of your custom scheme
        const route = url.replace('https://yourdomain.com', '') // Remove the domain
        // Implement your navigation logic based on the 'route'
        alert(`Navigating to: ${route}`) // Example: navigate to a specific screen
      }
    }

    Linking.addEventListener('url', handleDeepLink)

    Linking.getInitialURL()
      .then((url) => {
        if (url) {
          handleDeepLink({ url })
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => console.error('An error occurred', err))

    return () => {
      Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleDeepLink)
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Key Difference:**

- The crucial difference is that the URLs you receive from Universal Links will start with `https://yourdomain.com` instead of your custom URL scheme (e.g., `myawesomeapp://`). Therefore, in the `handleDeepLink` function, you'll need to adjust the `replace` method accordingly: `const route = url.replace('https://yourdomain.com', '');`

**Testing Your Universal Links:**

- **iOS:** The system automatically tries to verify the links on first install of the application. If it fails, try uninstalling and reinstalling the app to trigger the verification again. You can check the system logs for details.
- **Android:** Use the `adb shell pm verify-applinks --re-verify <your_package_name>` command to re-verify your app links. Also, inspect the system logs for verification errors.

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

- **Unique URL Schemes:** Ensure your URL scheme is unique to avoid conflicts with other apps.
- **HTTPS for Universal Linking:** Your website _must_ be served over HTTPS for Universal Linking to work correctly.
- **Correct `apple-app-site-association`:** Double-check the format and content of your `apple-app-site-association` file. Ensure the `appID` and `paths` are correct. Validate the JSON format.
- **Server Configuration:** Verify that your web server is correctly serving the `apple-app-site-association` file with the correct MIME type (`application/json` or `text/plain`).
- **Domain Verification:** Allow sufficient time for iOS and Android to verify the association between your app and your website.
- **Debugging Tools:** Use the Apple System Logs (for iOS) and the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) logs to troubleshoot any issues.
- **Clear Cache:** Sometimes, clearing the cache on your device or simulator can resolve issues related to deep linking.
- **Expo Updates:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Expo and related libraries.
- **Prebuild or Eject Carefully:** While prebuilding or ejecting gives you more control, it also requires you to manage the native code yourself. Only prebuild or eject if you have a clear understanding of what you are doing. Consider using environment variables to manage different configurations for managed vs. bare workflows.

## Conclusion

Mastering URL schemes and universal linking is crucial for creating a seamless and engaging user experience in your Expo React Native applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily implement deep linking functionality and unlock the full potential of your app. Remember to carefully configure your `app.json`, handle incoming URLs in your code, and adhere to best practices for both URL schemes and universal linking. Good luck, and happy coding!
