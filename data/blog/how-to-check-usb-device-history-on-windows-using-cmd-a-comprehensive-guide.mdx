# How to Check USB Device History on Windows Using CMD: A Comprehensive Guide

Understanding your computer's USB device history can be valuable for several reasons, from troubleshooting connectivity issues to security auditing. Knowing which USB devices have been connected to your system, when they were connected, and their identifying information can provide vital insights. While Windows doesn't offer a dedicated "USB History" viewer in its GUI, the Command Prompt (CMD) and the Windows Registry hold the keys to uncovering this information.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through various methods of checking USB device history using CMD and related techniques in Windows. We'll cover finding basic connected device information, digging deeper into the registry for more detailed history, and even provide troubleshooting tips.

## Why Check USB Device History?

Before we dive into the 'how,' let's briefly address the 'why.' Checking your USB device history can be beneficial for:

- **Troubleshooting:** Identifying when a device stopped working correctly can help pinpoint the source of the problem (driver issues, hardware failure, etc.).
- **Security Auditing:** Monitoring which USB drives have been connected to a system is crucial for preventing data leakage or the introduction of malware. This is particularly important in corporate environments.
- **Forensic Analysis:** In investigations, USB history can provide valuable evidence about the transfer of files or the presence of specific devices.
- **General Awareness:** Simply knowing which devices have interacted with your system can offer peace of mind and help you manage your digital footprint.

## Method 1: Using the `driverquery` Command

The `driverquery` command is a built-in CMD utility that displays a list of installed device drivers. While it doesn't directly provide a USB history, it can show you currently connected USB devices.

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:** Search for "cmd" in the Start Menu, right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator." This is crucial, as some commands require elevated privileges.

2.  **Execute the `driverquery` command:** Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```plaintext
    driverquery /v /fo csv | findstr /i "usb"
    ```

    Let's break down this command:

    - `driverquery`: The main command to query drivers.
    - `/v`: Specifies verbose output, providing more details.
    - `/fo csv`: Formats the output as comma-separated values (CSV), making it easier to parse.
    - `|`: The pipe operator, which redirects the output of `driverquery` to the `findstr` command.
    - `findstr /i "usb"`: Searches the output for lines containing "usb" (case-insensitive).

3.  **Analyze the Output:** The output will display a list of USB drivers and associated information, including the driver name, display name, driver type, and link date. This helps identify currently connected USB devices and the drivers they are using. The "Module Name" column often reveals the actual driver file name.

**Limitations of `driverquery`:**

- Only shows currently connected devices. It doesn't provide historical data of previously connected devices.
- The output can be overwhelming. Filtering it using `findstr` is essential.
- Information is limited to driver details and doesn't include serial numbers or precise connection timestamps.

## Method 2: Exploring the Windows Registry

The Windows Registry stores a wealth of information about your system, including historical data about connected USB devices. This is where we'll find the most comprehensive information. **Be extremely cautious when editing the registry, as incorrect changes can destabilize your system. It is strongly recommended to back up your registry before making any modifications.**

1.  **Open Registry Editor:** Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter. Grant administrative permissions if prompted.

2.  **Navigate to the USB Device History Keys:** The primary registry keys containing USB device history are located under:

    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB`

3.  **Examine the `USBSTOR` Key:** The `USBSTOR` key contains information about mass storage devices that have been connected, such as USB drives. Within this key, you'll find subkeys named according to the device's Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID). For example:

    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\Disk&Ven_SanDisk&Prod_Cruzer_Glide&Rev_1.00\4C532001150916105290`

    - `Disk`: Indicates the device type (disk drive).
    - `Ven_SanDisk`: Vendor ID (SanDisk).
    - `Prod_Cruzer_Glide`: Product ID (Cruzer Glide).
    - `Rev_1.00`: Revision number.
    - `4C532001150916105290`: Serial number of the device (this is usually what you're looking for).

    Within each of these subkeys, look for values like:

    - `FriendlyName`: A more descriptive name of the device.
    - `LocationInformation`: Provides details about the port the device was connected to.
    - `Device Parameters`: Potentially useful information about device settings.

4.  **Examine the `USB` Key:** The `USB` key contains information about all USB devices, including those that are not mass storage devices (e.g., keyboards, mice, printers). The structure is similar to the `USBSTOR` key, with subkeys based on VID and PID.

5.  **Identifying Connection Dates (Using `DeviceLog` - Advanced):** Unfortunately, the Registry Keys under `USBSTOR` and `USB` don't directly provide the date the USB device was _first_ connected. However, a dedicated "DeviceLog" exists that holds this information.

    - **Navigate to the DeviceLog:** The relevant log is located at:

      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceLog`

    - **Search for the Device Instance ID:** The keys under `USBSTOR` and `USB` mentioned above contain the "Device Instance ID." This is a unique identifier for the USB device. This Device Instance ID is used to uniquely identify the device in the `DeviceLog`.

    - **Locate the First Installation Date:** Under `DeviceLog`, find the subkey that corresponds to the device instance ID you found previously. Within that key, you should find a value named `FirstInstallDate`. This contains the date and time the device was first connected to your system. The date is in UTC format.

    **Important Considerations for the Registry:**

    - The Registry can become cluttered over time, so older entries may be overwritten or deleted.
    - The level of detail stored in the Registry can vary depending on the device and system settings.
    - Directly editing the Registry can be risky. Always back up your registry before making any changes.

## Method 3: Using PowerShell (for Scripting and Automation)

PowerShell provides a more powerful and flexible way to query USB device history compared to CMD. You can use PowerShell scripts to automate the process of extracting information from the Registry and formatting the output.

Here's an example PowerShell script to retrieve USB device information from the Registry:

```powershell
# Get USBSTOR Device Information
$USBSTORDevices = Get-ChildItem "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR"

foreach ($Device in $USBSTORDevices) {
    Write-Host "Device Path: $($Device.Name)"
    $DeviceProperties = Get-ItemProperty $Device.Name
    Write-Host "Friendly Name: $($DeviceProperties.FriendlyName)"
    Write-Host "Serial Number (Likely): $($Device.Name.Split('\')[-1])"
    Write-Host "---"
}

# Get USB Device Information (Non-Storage)
$USBDevices = Get-ChildItem "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB"

foreach ($Device in $USBDevices) {
    Write-Host "Device Path: $($Device.Name)"
    $DeviceProperties = Get-ItemProperty $Device.Name
    if ($DeviceProperties.FriendlyName) {
        Write-Host "Friendly Name: $($DeviceProperties.FriendlyName)"
    } else {
        Write-Host "Friendly Name: N/A"
    }

    Write-Host "---"
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `Get-ChildItem "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR"`: Retrieves all subkeys under the `USBSTOR` key.
- `foreach ($Device in $USBSTORDevices)`: Iterates through each device found.
- `Get-ItemProperty $Device.Name`: Retrieves the properties of each device (e.g., FriendlyName).
- `Write-Host`: Outputs the information to the console.
- `$Device.Name.Split('\')[-1]`: Extracts the potential serial number from the device path.

**To run this script:**

1.  Save the script as a `.ps1` file (e.g., `Get-USBHistory.ps1`).
2.  Open PowerShell as Administrator.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
4.  Execute the script using: `.\Get-USBHistory.ps1`

**Advantages of PowerShell:**

- More structured output and easier data manipulation.
- Ability to automate the process and save the results to a file.
- Enhanced filtering and searching capabilities.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **"Access Denied" Error:** When using CMD or PowerShell, ensure you are running the command prompt or PowerShell console as an administrator. This is essential for accessing the Registry and querying device drivers.

- **Missing USB History:** Windows may not retain USB history indefinitely. The retention period can vary depending on system settings and available storage space.

- **Conflicting Information:** Sometimes, the information in the Registry might be inconsistent or incomplete. This can occur if drivers are not installed correctly or if devices are removed improperly.

- **Registry Backup Before Modification:** Always back up the registry before making manual changes. Go to File > Export. Choose "All" under export range and save to a location you can remember.

## Conclusion

Checking USB device history in Windows using CMD, the Registry, and PowerShell provides valuable insights into device usage and potential security risks. While the process may require some technical expertise, the information you can uncover is crucial for troubleshooting, security auditing, and forensic analysis. Remember to exercise caution when editing the Registry and always back up your system before making significant changes. By combining the methods outlined in this guide, you can effectively track and manage the USB devices that interact with your Windows system.
