# Next.js Custom \_app.js: When and How to Use It (Complete Guide)

The `_app.js` (or `_app.tsx` if you're using TypeScript) file in your Next.js project plays a crucial role in initializing all pages. It allows you to override the default App component and control the initial page render. While Next.js works great out of the box without a custom `_app.js`, understanding when and how to use it opens up powerful possibilities for customizing your application. This guide will delve into scenarios where creating a custom `_app.js` is beneficial and provide practical code examples.

## What is `_app.js`?

In a Next.js application, the `_app.js` file serves as the entry point for all your pages. It's a special file that Next.js uses to initialize the React App component. By default, Next.js provides a default `App` component that handles the initial page rendering. However, creating your own `_app.js` allows you to:

- **Persist Layout Between Page Transitions:** Maintain a consistent layout across your entire application.
- **Inject Global Styles:** Apply global CSS styles or use CSS-in-JS libraries for styling.
- **Manage React Context Providers:** Wrap your entire application with React Context providers to make data available to all pages.
- **Control Page Initialization:** Override the default page initialization process if needed.
- **Add Global Third-Party Libraries:** Initialize libraries like analytics or authentication providers across the whole application.

## When Should You Create a Custom `_app.js`?

Here's a breakdown of common scenarios where you'll benefit from a custom `_app.js` file:

### 1. Persistent Layout

One of the most frequent uses of `_app.js` is to maintain a consistent layout across all pages. This can include headers, footers, navigation bars, and sidebars. Without a custom `_app.js`, these elements would re-render on every page transition, leading to a less-than-optimal user experience.

**Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/_app.js
import '../styles/globals.css' // Importing Global Styles

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        {/* Navigation Bar */}
        <nav>
          <a href="/">Home</a> | <a href="/about">About</a> | <a href="/blog">Blog</a>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <footer>
        {/* Footer Content */}
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Awesome Website</p>
      </footer>
    </>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

In this example, the header and footer will remain persistent across all pages in your Next.js application. `Component` represents the actual page being rendered (e.g., `pages/index.js`, `pages/about.js`). `pageProps` are props passed to the page component.

### 2. Global Styles

`_app.js` is the perfect place to import global CSS stylesheets or CSS-in-JS libraries. This ensures that your styles are applied to the entire application.

**Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/_app.js
import '../styles/globals.css' // Importing Global Styles (CSS)
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';
import theme from '../theme'; // Your custom Material-UI theme

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* CssBaseline kickstart an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon. */}
      <CssBaseline />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

Here, we are importing `globals.css` for CSS-based styling, but also demonstrating how to use Material-UI's `ThemeProvider` and `CssBaseline` to apply a custom theme globally. `CssBaseline` is a component that resets the browser's default styles to provide a more consistent starting point.

### 3. React Context Providers

If you're using React Context to manage global state or provide data to your components, you'll need to wrap your application with the necessary Context providers. `_app.js` is the ideal place to do this.

**Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/_app.js
import { AuthProvider } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

In this example, we're wrapping the entire application with the `AuthProvider`. This makes the authentication context available to all pages and components within your Next.js application. The `AuthProvider` component would typically handle user authentication logic and provide the authentication state via React Context.

### 4. Initializing Third-Party Libraries

If you need to initialize third-party libraries that require global setup, `_app.js` is a good place to do it. For example, initializing Google Analytics, setting up an authentication SDK, or configuring a UI library.

**Example (Google Analytics):**

```plaintext
// pages/_app.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import * as gtag from '../lib/gtag';
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
      gtag.pageview(url);
    };

    router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChange);

    return () => {
      router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChange);
    };
  }, [router.events]);

  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

This example sets up Google Analytics tracking by listening to route changes and sending pageview events. The `gtag.js` file would contain the Google Analytics initialization and event tracking functions. This example depends on having a `lib/gtag.js` file that contains the relevant functions.

### 5. Preventing Page Flashing (with Next.js 13 and later)

In Next.js 13 and later versions (using the `app` directory), you might encounter an issue where the page flashes briefly during transitions. This often happens when using a server-side rendered component that relies on client-side data fetching. To mitigate this, you can use the `_app.js` (which is more accurately referred to as a root layout file in the `app` directory) to initialize certain client-side dependencies or ensure a consistent initial state. This is more complex and usually handled within the layouts of the `app` directory but demonstrating a simple example:

```plaintext
// app/layout.js (equivalent to _app.js in pages directory for layout purposes)
import './globals.css' // Import global styles
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
}

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  // Add Providers here if needed in the future to ensure proper initialization
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}

```

In this `app/layout.js` file (which serves the role of `_app.js` for layout purposes) we've demonstrated setting up a global font but also highlighted the section to add Providers, which can sometimes help mitigate flashing issues. The actual solution often depends on the specific data fetching and component structure, but strategically using the root layout can provide a consistent initial environment.

## Code Considerations and Best Practices

- **Keep it Lean:** Avoid putting too much logic in `_app.js`. Its primary purpose is to initialize the application, not to handle complex business logic.
- **Performance:** Be mindful of performance implications. Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Type Safety:** Use TypeScript to type your `_app.js` component and its props.
- **Async Data Fetching:** Avoid asynchronous data fetching within the `_app.js` component itself, especially in versions prior to Next.js 13. Use the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` on individual pages when fetching data is needed. For the `app` directory in Next.js 13 and later, use server components or data fetching strategies within individual layout and page files.
- **Upgrade carefully**: With Next.js 13 introducing the `app` directory, migration from the `pages` directory requires understanding the new component structure and data fetching patterns. The `_app.js` concept remains relevant but is primarily achieved through root layouts (`app/layout.js`) and the strategic use of server and client components.
- **Consider other Layouts:** In Next.js 13 and later, layout files within directories in the `app` directory can often be a better alternative than a complex root layout (`app/layout.js`), allowing you to define specific layouts for different sections of your application.

## Example: TypeScript with Context and Global Styles

Here's a more complete example using TypeScript, React Context, and global styles:

```typescript
// pages/_app.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';
import theme from '../theme';
import { AuthProvider } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
import '../styles/globals.css';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <CssBaseline />
      <AuthProvider>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </AuthProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

In this TypeScript example, we:

- Import `AppProps` from `next/app` to type the component's props.
- Wrap the application with `ThemeProvider`, `CssBaseline` and `AuthProvider`.
- Import global styles from `../styles/globals.css`.

## Conclusion

The `_app.js` file (or its equivalent in the `app` directory with Next.js 13 and later) is a powerful tool for customizing your Next.js application. By understanding when and how to use it, you can create a more consistent, maintainable, and performant user experience. Consider the scenarios outlined in this guide, and use the provided code examples as a starting point for your own custom implementations. Remember to carefully consider the implications of changes to `_app.js`, especially when migrating from the `pages` directory to the `app` directory in Next.js 13 and later.
