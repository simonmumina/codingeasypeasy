# How to Execute Raw SQL Queries in Django: A Comprehensive Guide

Django's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a powerful tool for interacting with databases. It allows you to perform database operations using Python code, abstracting away the complexities of SQL. However, there are situations where you might need to execute raw SQL queries directly. This might be for performance optimization, accessing database-specific features, or performing complex operations that are difficult to express using the ORM.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the different ways to execute raw SQL queries in Django, covering best practices, security considerations, and code examples.

## Why Use Raw SQL Queries in Django?

While Django's ORM is generally sufficient for most database interactions, there are several reasons why you might consider using raw SQL queries:

- **Performance Optimization:** For complex queries or operations, raw SQL can often be more performant than the ORM. You can fine-tune the query to take advantage of specific database features and indexing strategies.
- **Database-Specific Features:** If you need to use features that are specific to your database (e.g., PostgreSQL's `JSONB` functions or MySQL's full-text search), raw SQL allows you to access them directly.
- **Complex Queries:** Some complex queries, especially those involving subqueries, window functions, or recursive CTEs, can be challenging or impossible to express effectively using the ORM.
- **Legacy Databases:** When working with legacy databases that don't conform to Django's ORM conventions, raw SQL might be the only viable option.
- **Direct Data Manipulation:** In some cases, you may need to manipulate data directly at the database level without involving Django models.

## Methods for Executing Raw SQL Queries in Django

Django provides several ways to execute raw SQL queries. The most common method involves using the `connection.cursor()` method.

### 1. Using `connection.cursor()`

This is the most direct and flexible way to execute raw SQL queries in Django. It allows you to interact with the database connection directly.

**Steps:**

1.  **Import the `connection` object:**

    ```plaintext
    from django.db import connection
    ```

2.  **Obtain a cursor object:**

    ```plaintext
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        # Your SQL query goes here
    ```

    Using a `with` statement ensures that the cursor is properly closed after the operation, preventing resource leaks.

3.  **Execute the SQL query:**

    ```plaintext
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = %s", [123])
    ```

    - **Important:** Use parameterized queries (`%s` for placeholders) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Pass the parameters as a list or tuple as the second argument to `cursor.execute()`.

4.  **Fetch the results:**

    ```plaintext
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = %s", [123])
        row = cursor.fetchone()  # Fetch a single row
        rows = cursor.fetchall() # Fetch all rows
        # Iterate through the rows
        for row in rows:
          print(row)
    ```

**Example:**

```plaintext
from django.db import connection

def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT id, username, email FROM auth_user WHERE id = %s", [user_id])
        user = cursor.fetchone()
        if user:
            return {
                'id': user[0],
                'username': user[1],
                'email': user[2]
            }
        else:
            return None

# Example usage:
user = get_user_by_id(1)
if user:
    print(f"User ID: {user['id']}, Username: {user['username']}, Email: {user['email']}")
else:
    print("User not found.")
```

**Explanation:**

- The `get_user_by_id` function takes a `user_id` as input.
- It uses `connection.cursor()` to get a cursor object.
- It executes a parameterized SQL query to select the `id`, `username`, and `email` from the `auth_user` table (Django's built-in user table) where the `id` matches the provided `user_id`.
- `cursor.fetchone()` retrieves a single row from the result set.
- If a user is found, it returns a dictionary containing the user's information. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

### 2. Using `RawSQL` in `QuerySet.annotate()`

Django provides the `RawSQL` class, which allows you to inject raw SQL fragments into ORM queries. This is useful when you need to use database-specific functions or perform calculations that are difficult to express using the ORM. It's typically used in conjunction with `QuerySet.annotate()` to add custom fields to your models.

**Example:**

```plaintext
from django.db.models import Value, CharField
from django.db.models.functions import Concat
from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL
from myapp.models import MyModel  # Replace myapp.models with your actual model import

def get_models_with_custom_field():
    queryset = MyModel.objects.annotate(
        custom_field=RawSQL("UPPER(my_field)", ())  # Assuming MyModel has a field called 'my_field'
    )
    return queryset

# Example usage:
models = get_models_with_custom_field()
for model in models:
    print(f"MyModel ID: {model.id}, Custom Field: {model.custom_field}")
```

**Explanation:**

- `RawSQL("UPPER(my_field)", ())` injects the SQL fragment `UPPER(my_field)` into the query. The second argument, `()`, is an empty tuple indicating that there are no parameters for the SQL fragment.
- `queryset.annotate(custom_field=RawSQL(...))` adds a new field called `custom_field` to the `MyModel` instances in the queryset. The value of `custom_field` will be the result of the `UPPER(my_field)` SQL function.

### 3. Using `extra()` (Less Common, Potentially Deprecated)

The `extra()` method allows you to inject arbitrary SQL fragments into a queryset. However, it's generally considered less maintainable and less secure than `RawSQL` and is being discouraged in newer Django versions. Use with caution.

**Example (Use with care):**

```plaintext
from myapp.models import MyModel  # Replace myapp.models with your actual model import

def get_models_with_custom_field_extra():
    queryset = MyModel.objects.extra(
        select={'custom_field': "UPPER(my_field)"}  # Assuming MyModel has a field called 'my_field'
    )
    return queryset

# Example usage:
models = get_models_with_custom_field_extra()
for model in models:
    print(f"MyModel ID: {model.id}, Custom Field: {model.custom_field}")
```

**Why `extra()` is discouraged:**

- **SQL Injection Risks:** It's easier to introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if you're not careful when constructing the SQL fragments.
- **Maintainability:** The SQL fragments are embedded directly within the Python code, making the code harder to read and maintain.
- **Database Compatibility:** The SQL fragments might not be portable across different database backends.

### 4. Using `Model.objects.raw()` (For Model Instances)

The `raw()` method allows you to execute raw SQL queries and map the results to model instances. This is useful when you want to retrieve data that doesn't directly correspond to a single model field, but you still want to work with model objects.

**Example:**

```plaintext
from myapp.models import MyModel  # Replace myapp.models with your actual model import

def get_models_from_raw_sql():
    sql = "SELECT id, my_field FROM myapp_mymodel WHERE my_field LIKE '%test%'"
    models = MyModel.objects.raw(sql)  # Assumes your model is named MyModel and the table is 'myapp_mymodel'

    return models

# Example usage:
models = get_models_from_raw_sql()
for model in models:
    print(f"Model ID: {model.id}, My Field: {model.my_field}")
```

**Important Considerations for `Model.objects.raw()`:**

- **Field Names:** The SQL query _must_ include all primary key fields of the model, aliased correctly to match the model field names. If you have a primary key called `id`, your query must select it as `id`.
- **Mapping:** Django attempts to map the columns in the result set to the model's fields. Columns that don't match model fields are ignored.

## Security Considerations: Preventing SQL Injection

SQL injection is a serious security vulnerability that can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on your database. It's crucial to take precautions to prevent SQL injection when using raw SQL queries.

**Best Practices:**

- **Always Use Parameterized Queries:** Never concatenate user-provided input directly into SQL strings. Use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) where placeholders are used to represent the values. Django will then automatically escape the values before executing the query.

  ```plaintext
  # Correct (Parameterized Query)
  with connection.cursor() as cursor:
      cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", [username, password])

  # Incorrect (Vulnerable to SQL Injection)
  # NEVER DO THIS!
  # with connection.cursor() as cursor:
  #     cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'")
  ```

- **Validate and Sanitize User Input:** Even with parameterized queries, it's a good practice to validate and sanitize user input to ensure that it conforms to your expected format. This can help prevent unexpected errors or malicious input.

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage that can be caused by a SQL injection attack.

## Best Practices for Raw SQL Queries in Django

- **Document Your Queries:** Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of each raw SQL query and why it was necessary to use raw SQL instead of the ORM.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your raw SQL queries extensively to ensure that they are working correctly and efficiently.
- **Consider Using Database-Specific Libraries:** For complex database-specific operations, consider using libraries that provide a higher-level abstraction layer over the raw database API.
- **Monitor Performance:** Monitor the performance of your raw SQL queries and optimize them as needed.
- **Avoid Mixing ORM and Raw SQL Excessively:** While mixing ORM and raw SQL can be necessary, try to minimize it to maintain code readability and maintainability. Consider refactoring your code to use the ORM as much as possible.

## Conclusion

Raw SQL queries in Django provide a powerful way to interact with your database directly. By understanding the different methods for executing raw SQL, and by following best practices for security and performance, you can effectively leverage raw SQL when the ORM is not sufficient, without compromising the security or maintainability of your application. Remember to always prioritize parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
