# Bun with Expo and EAS: A Comprehensive Guide to Faster React Native Development

React Native development can sometimes be sluggish, especially when dealing with large projects. The default Node.js-based tooling can introduce performance bottlenecks. Enter **Bun**, a fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager, designed to replace Node.js, npm, webpack, and more. Integrating Bun with Expo and EAS (Expo Application Services) offers a significant performance boost to your React Native development workflow.

This guide will walk you through setting up Bun with Expo and leveraging it in your EAS builds. We'll cover installation, configuration, common pitfalls, and best practices to maximize your development speed and efficiency.

## Why Use Bun with Expo?

Before we dive into the how-to, let's explore the benefits:

- **Speed:** Bun is known for its speed. It uses the JavaScriptCore engine (the same engine Safari uses) and is written in Zig, a low-level systems language, making it significantly faster than Node.js. This translates to faster installation times, quicker builds, and snappier development server reloads.
- **Simplified Tooling:** Bun aims to replace multiple tools in the JavaScript ecosystem. Its built-in bundler and package manager can simplify your project's dependencies and configuration.
- **TypeScript Support:** Bun has first-class TypeScript support out of the box. No need for `ts-node` or extra configuration.
- **EAS Compatibility:** With a few tweaks, you can seamlessly integrate Bun into your EAS build process, bringing its performance benefits to your production builds.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm:** You'll need Node.js and npm initially for installing Expo CLI. While we'll transition to Bun for most operations, some legacy dependencies might still require npm.
- **Expo CLI:** Install the Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- **EAS Account:** Sign up for an EAS account at [https://expo.dev/](https://expo.dev/).
- **Expo Project:** You should have an existing Expo project or create a new one using `expo init`.
- **Basic React Native Knowledge:** A basic understanding of React Native concepts is assumed.

## Step 1: Installing and Setting Up Bun

First, install Bun on your system. The installation process varies depending on your operating system. Refer to the official Bun documentation for the most up-to-date instructions: [https://bun.sh/](https://bun.sh/)

**macOS (using curl):**

```plaintext
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**Linux (using curl):**

```plaintext
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

After installation, add Bun to your `PATH`. The installer usually provides instructions, but it typically involves adding a line similar to the following to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```plaintext
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

Restart your terminal or source your shell configuration file for the changes to take effect.

Verify that Bun is installed correctly by running:

```plaintext
bun --version
```

This should print the installed Bun version.

## Step 2: Converting Your Expo Project to Use Bun

Now, let's transition your Expo project to use Bun.

1.  **Remove `node_modules` and Lockfiles:**

    Remove the existing `node_modules` directory and lockfiles (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`). This ensures a clean slate for Bun to install dependencies.

    ```plaintext
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies with Bun:**

    Use `bun install` to install the project's dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.

    ```plaintext
    bun install
    ```

    This command is significantly faster than `npm install` or `yarn install`. Bun uses a global cache and optimizes dependency resolution for speed.

3.  **Running Expo Commands with Bun:**

    Instead of `npm start` or `yarn start`, use `bun run start` to start your Expo development server.

    ```plaintext
    bun run start
    ```

    This tells Bun to execute the `start` script defined in your `package.json`. Make sure your `package.json` scripts are correctly configured:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-expo-app",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "expo start",
        "android": "expo start --android",
        "ios": "expo start --ios",
        "web": "expo start --web",
        "eject": "expo eject"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "expo": "~49.0.15",
        "expo-status-bar": "~1.6.0",
        "react": "18.2.0",
        "react-native": "0.72.6"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@babel/core": "^7.20.0"
      },
      "private": true
    }
    ```

    **Important:** Expo CLI typically uses Node.js. We're telling Bun to execute the Expo CLI commands.

4.  **TypeScript Support:**

    If your project uses TypeScript, Bun will automatically handle the compilation. No need for extra configuration like `ts-node` or `tsc`.

    For example, if you have a `index.tsx` file as your entry point, Bun will transpile it on the fly when running `bun run start`.

## Step 3: Integrating Bun with EAS Builds

To leverage Bun's speed in your EAS builds, you need to configure your `eas.json` file.

1.  **Update `eas.json`:**

    Modify your `eas.json` file to use Bun for installing dependencies and running build scripts. Here's an example:

    ```json
    {
      "build": {
        "development": {
          "distribution": "internal",
          "buildCommand": "bun install && bun run build:dev", // Use bun for build
          "nodeVersion": "18" // or higher, as required by Expo
        },
        "production": {
          "buildCommand": "bun install && bun run build", // Use bun for build
          "nodeVersion": "18" // or higher, as required by Expo
        }
      },
      "submit": {
        "production": {}
      }
    }
    ```

    - **`buildCommand`:** This is the crucial part. Replace the default `npm install && npm run build` (or similar) with `bun install && bun run build`. Make sure you have a `build` script defined in your `package.json`.
    - **`nodeVersion`:** While Bun handles most JavaScript execution, EAS still relies on a Node.js environment for certain tasks. Specify a Node.js version compatible with your Expo SDK version. Check Expo's documentation for the recommended Node.js version.

2.  **Define `build` Scripts in `package.json`:**

    Add or modify your `build` scripts in `package.json` to use Expo's build commands. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "start": "expo start",
        "android": "expo start --android",
        "ios": "expo start --ios",
        "web": "expo start --web",
        "eject": "expo eject",
        "build": "expo build:android -t apk", // Example Android build
        "build:dev": "expo build:android -t apk --no-wait" // Example dev build
      }
    }
    ```

    Adjust the `build` scripts to match your specific build requirements (Android, iOS, different build types, etc.).

3.  **Local Testing before EAS Build (Important):**

    Before you push your changes to EAS, it is _highly_ recommended that you test your build command locally. This involves running the same command that EAS will execute:

    ```plaintext
    bun install && bun run build
    ```

    Make sure this completes successfully without errors. This helps identify any missing dependencies or configuration issues _before_ wasting EAS build minutes.

4.  **Trigger an EAS Build:**

    Now, you can trigger an EAS build using the `eas build` command:

    ```plaintext
    eas build --platform android
    ```

    or

    ```plaintext
    eas build --platform ios
    ```

    EAS will use Bun to install dependencies and run your build script, resulting in faster build times.

## Step 4: Troubleshooting and Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

- **`Module not found: Can't resolve '...'`:** This usually indicates a missing dependency. Make sure all required dependencies are listed in your `package.json` and installed correctly with `bun install`.
- **`TypeError: ... is not a function`:** This can happen if a package you're using is not fully compatible with Bun. Try updating the package to the latest version or consider using an alternative package. You might also need to investigate if the package relies on Node.js-specific APIs that Bun doesn't yet fully implement.
- **EAS Build Fails:** Carefully review your `eas.json` and `package.json` files for any typos or misconfigurations. Check the EAS build logs for detailed error messages. Make sure the Node.js version specified in `eas.json` is compatible with your Expo SDK version. As mentioned before, always test your `buildCommand` _locally_ before pushing to EAS.
- **Native Module Issues:** Bun doesn't yet support native modules in the same way Node.js does. If your project relies heavily on native modules, you might encounter issues. Consider alternative approaches or contribute to Bun's native module support.
- **Incompatible Packages:** Some packages might have explicit dependencies on Node.js features not fully implemented in Bun. In such cases, consider alternatives or file an issue with the Bun project for consideration. You may have to occasionally fallback to using `npm` or `yarn` for specific packages that refuse to install with `bun`. This is rare, but possible.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Bun Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Bun to benefit from the latest performance improvements and bug fixes.
- **Optimize Dependencies:** Review your project's dependencies and remove any unused or redundant packages.
- **Use ESM Syntax:** Embrace ES modules (ESM) syntax (`import` and `export`) for better performance and compatibility.
- **Leverage Bun's Bundler:** Explore Bun's built-in bundler for optimized code splitting and asset handling. While it might require some configuration, it can further improve build times.
- **Profile Your Builds:** Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your build process and optimize accordingly.
- **Cache Dependencies:** Bun's global cache significantly speeds up dependency installation. Ensure your CI/CD environment is configured to leverage this cache.
- **Monitor EAS Build Times:** Keep track of your EAS build times after integrating Bun to measure the performance improvements.

## Conclusion

Integrating Bun with Expo and EAS can dramatically accelerate your React Native development workflow. By leveraging Bun's speed and efficiency, you can reduce installation times, speed up builds, and improve overall development experience. While some configuration and troubleshooting might be required, the benefits of faster iteration and improved performance make it well worth the effort. As Bun continues to evolve, its integration with the React Native ecosystem will only become more seamless and powerful.
