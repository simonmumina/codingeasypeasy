# Fix: Internet Not Working in WSL After Sleep/Resume (sudo service network-manager restart)

Have you ever experienced the frustration of your Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) losing internet connectivity after your Windows machine wakes up from sleep? You open your terminal, try to `apt update`, and are greeted with "Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'" or similar network errors. This is a common issue, and fortunately, there's a relatively simple fix. This blog post will walk you through the most common solution and explore alternative approaches if that doesn't work.

## The Problem: Network Connectivity Loss in WSL

When Windows goes to sleep, it often disrupts the network interfaces that WSL relies on. Upon resuming, WSL sometimes fails to re-establish the connection automatically. This can leave your Linux environment without internet access, preventing you from installing packages, accessing online resources, and generally working as expected.

## The Solution: Restarting Network Manager

The most reliable and widely recommended solution involves restarting the `network-manager` service within your WSL distribution. This service is responsible for managing network connections in Linux.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open your WSL terminal:** Launch your preferred WSL distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian).

2.  **Execute the restart command:** Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```plaintext
    sudo service network-manager restart
    ```

    You'll likely be prompted for your sudo password. Enter it carefully.

3.  **Verify connectivity:** After the command executes, test your internet connection by pinging a reliable website:

    ```plaintext
    ping google.com
    ```

    If you receive replies, congratulations! You've successfully restored internet connectivity.

    ```
    PING google.com (142.250.185.142) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from fra16s01-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.185.142): icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=8.48 ms
    64 bytes from fra16s01-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.185.142): icmp_seq=2 ttl=117 time=7.70 ms
    64 bytes from fra16s01-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.185.142): icmp_seq=3 ttl=117 time=7.91 ms
    ```

**Explanation:**

The `sudo service network-manager restart` command tells the Linux system to stop and then start the `network-manager` service. This forces it to re-establish connections with the available network interfaces, effectively resolving the connectivity issue.

## Alternative Solutions (If Restarting Network Manager Doesn't Work)

While restarting `network-manager` is usually sufficient, sometimes more drastic measures are required. Here are a few alternative solutions:

### 1. Restart the WSL Environment

A more aggressive approach is to restart the entire WSL environment. This essentially restarts the virtual machine that WSL runs on.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator:** Right-click the Windows Start button and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Terminal (Admin)".

2.  **Execute the WSL shutdown command:** Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

3.  **Restart your WSL distribution:** Launch your WSL distribution again.

4.  **Verify connectivity:** Ping a website to confirm internet access.

**Explanation:**

The `wsl --shutdown` command completely shuts down the WSL virtual machine. When you relaunch your WSL distribution, it starts fresh, forcing it to re-establish network connections. This can resolve more persistent network issues.

### 2. Check DNS Configuration

Sometimes, the problem lies in the DNS configuration within WSL. Incorrect or outdated DNS settings can prevent you from resolving domain names, even if you have a network connection.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open your WSL terminal.**

2.  **Edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file:** Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` to open the file:

    ```plaintext
    sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

    or

    ```plaintext
    sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

3.  **Add or modify the DNS nameserver:** Add the following line to the file, using a reliable DNS server like Google's public DNS:

    ```
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    ```

    You can also add a secondary DNS server:

    ```
    nameserver 8.8.4.4
    ```

4.  **Save the file and exit the editor.** In `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to save, and `Enter`. In `vim`, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

5.  **Restart the networking service:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo service networking restart
    ```

    or

    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl restart networking
    ```

6.  **Verify connectivity:** Ping a website to confirm internet access.

**Important Note:** The `/etc/resolv.conf` file is often automatically generated and overwritten by WSL. To make your changes persistent, you may need to modify the `/etc/wsl.conf` file.

Add the following lines to `/etc/wsl.conf`:

```plaintext
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
```

Then, repeat steps 2-6 above.

**Explanation:**

This solution manually configures the DNS server that WSL uses to resolve domain names. Using a reliable public DNS server like Google's (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) can bypass DNS issues caused by your ISP or local network. Modifying `/etc/wsl.conf` ensures that WSL doesn't automatically overwrite your DNS settings.

### 3. Disable and Re-enable the WSL Network Adapter

Sometimes the network adapter within Windows that WSL uses gets into a bad state. Disabling and re-enabling it can resolve the issue.

**Steps:**

1. **Open Network Connections:** Search for "View Network Connections" in the Windows Start menu and open it.

2. **Identify the WSL Adapter:** Look for a network adapter with a name similar to "vEthernet (WSL)" or "vEthernet (WSL 2)". The name might vary slightly depending on your WSL version and configuration.

3. **Disable the Adapter:** Right-click the WSL adapter and select "Disable".

4. **Re-enable the Adapter:** Right-click the disabled WSL adapter and select "Enable".

5. **Restart WSL:** Follow the steps in solution 1 to restart the WSL environment (using `wsl --shutdown`).

6. **Verify connectivity:** Ping a website to confirm internet access.

**Explanation:**

This process forces Windows to re-initialize the network adapter used by WSL, potentially resolving issues related to its configuration or state.

### 4. Ensure WSL is Using WSL2

WSL 2 offers improved performance and better integration with Windows networking compared to WSL 1. If you're still using WSL 1, upgrading to WSL 2 might resolve your connectivity issues.

**Steps:**

1.  **Check your WSL version:** Open PowerShell and run the following command:

    ```powershell
    wsl -l -v
    ```

    This will list your installed WSL distributions and their versions. Look for your distribution in the list. If the "VERSION" column shows "1", you're using WSL 1.

2.  **Upgrade to WSL 2 (if necessary):** If you're using WSL 1, follow Microsoft's official documentation to upgrade to WSL 2: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

    **Important:** Upgrading to WSL 2 involves converting your existing WSL distribution. This process can take some time and may require you to reinstall some packages. Back up your important data before proceeding.

**Explanation:**

WSL 2 uses a virtualized Linux kernel, which provides better compatibility and performance. It also integrates more seamlessly with Windows networking, reducing the likelihood of connectivity issues after sleep/resume.

## Preventing Future Issues

While the solutions above can resolve the immediate problem, you can take steps to prevent these issues from recurring:

- **Keep WSL updated:** Regularly update your WSL distribution using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`. This ensures that you have the latest network drivers and bug fixes.
- **Keep Windows updated:** Similarly, keep your Windows installation up-to-date with the latest updates and security patches.
- **Configure a static IP address (Advanced):** For more advanced users, configuring a static IP address within WSL can provide more consistent network connectivity. This requires careful configuration and an understanding of networking concepts. Refer to online guides for detailed instructions.

## Conclusion

Losing internet connectivity in WSL after Windows sleep/resume can be a frustrating experience. However, by restarting the `network-manager` service with `sudo service network-manager restart`, or by using one of the alternative solutions outlined above, you can usually restore your connection and get back to work. Remember to keep your WSL environment and Windows installation updated to minimize the risk of future issues. Good luck!
