# Combining Pyramid and FastAPI: Building Hybrid Web Applications in Python

In modern web development, choosing the right framework is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications. While frameworks like Pyramid and FastAPI each have their strengths, combining them into a hybrid application can leverage the best of both worlds. Pyramid provides a stable and structured foundation for complex web applications, while FastAPI excels in building fast and efficient APIs. This post will guide you through the process of integrating Pyramid and FastAPI to create powerful hybrid applications.

## Why Combine Pyramid and FastAPI?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand the benefits of this approach:

- **Legacy Application Integration:** Pyramid might be the backbone of an existing application. Instead of rewriting everything, FastAPI can be introduced for new features or to modernize existing parts as APIs.

- **Gradual Migration:** Moving from a monolithic Pyramid application to a microservices architecture can be a complex process. FastAPI can be used to gradually introduce microservices, starting with the API layer.

- **Performance and Asynchronous Capabilities:** FastAPI leverages asynchronous programming (async/await) to handle requests concurrently, which can significantly improve performance, especially for I/O-bound operations. Pyramid, while traditionally synchronous, can benefit from being augmented by FastAPI's capabilities.

- **API-First Development:** FastAPI's automatic data validation (using Pydantic) and API documentation (using OpenAPI) make it an excellent choice for building robust and well-documented APIs. You can use it as an API gateway for your Pyramid backend.

- **Modern Features:** FastAPI offers features like dependency injection, automatic data serialization/deserialization (using Pydantic), and built-in support for authentication and authorization, which can simplify development and improve code quality.

## Approaches to Integration

There are several ways to integrate Pyramid and FastAPI, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. We will cover the two main approaches:

1.  **FastAPI as a Separate Application (Reverse Proxy):** This approach runs FastAPI as a completely independent application, often deployed behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache. Pyramid and FastAPI communicate via HTTP requests.

2.  **Mounting FastAPI within Pyramid (ASGI Integration):** This method integrates FastAPI as part of the Pyramid application using ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). This provides tighter integration and potentially better performance for certain scenarios.

## 1. FastAPI as a Separate Application (Reverse Proxy)

This is the most common and straightforward approach, especially when dealing with an existing Pyramid application.

**Conceptual Diagram:**

```
[Client] --> [Reverse Proxy (Nginx/Apache)] --> [Pyramid Application]
                                                     |
                                                     --> [FastAPI Application]
```

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a FastAPI Application:**

    ```plaintext
    # fastapi_app.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/api/hello")
    async def read_root():
        return {"message": "Hello from FastAPI!"}

    @app.get("/api/items/{item_id}")
    async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
        return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
    ```

2.  **Create a Pyramid Application:**

    ```plaintext
    # pyramid_app.py
    from pyramid.config import Configurator
    from pyramid.view import view_config
    from pyramid.response import Response

    @view_config(route_name='home', renderer='string')
    def home_view(request):
        return "Hello from Pyramid!"

    def main(global_config, **settings):
        with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
            config.add_route('home', '/')
            config.scan('.') # Scans the current directory for views
            return config.make_wsgi_app()


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
        app = main({})
        server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 6543, app)
        server.serve_forever()
    ```

3.  **Configure a Reverse Proxy (Nginx Example):**

    ```nginx
    # nginx configuration file (e.g., /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_site)
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com; # Replace with your domain

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:6543; # Pyramid server
        }

        location /api {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # FastAPI server
        }
    }
    ```

4.  **Run the Applications:**

    - Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

      ```plaintext
      uvicorn fastapi_app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
      ```

    - Run the Pyramid application:

      ```plaintext
      python pyramid_app.py
      ```

5.  **Access the Applications:**

    - Pyramid: `http://example.com/` (or `http://localhost/` if using a local setup)
    - FastAPI: `http://example.com/api/hello` (or `http://localhost/api/hello`)

**Explanation:**

- The reverse proxy (Nginx in this case) acts as the entry point for all requests.
- Requests to `/` are proxied to the Pyramid application running on port 6543.
- Requests to `/api` are proxied to the FastAPI application running on port 8000.
- The `proxy_pass` directive in the Nginx configuration tells Nginx where to forward the requests.

**Advantages:**

- **Simple to implement:** This is the easiest way to integrate Pyramid and FastAPI.
- **Decoupled applications:** Pyramid and FastAPI are completely independent, allowing for separate deployment and scaling.
- **Clear separation of concerns:** You can clearly define which parts of your application are handled by Pyramid and which are handled by FastAPI.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Network overhead:** Communication between Pyramid and FastAPI involves HTTP requests, which can introduce some latency.
- **More complex deployment:** You need to manage and deploy two separate applications and configure the reverse proxy.

## 2. Mounting FastAPI within Pyramid (ASGI Integration)

This approach involves mounting the FastAPI application as a sub-application within the Pyramid application using an ASGI server.

**Conceptual Diagram:**

```
[Client] --> [Pyramid Application (with FastAPI mounted)]
```

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Necessary Packages:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install pyramid uvicorn asgiref fastapi
    ```

2.  **Create a Combined Application:**

    ```plaintext
    # combined_app.py
    from pyramid.config import Configurator
    from pyramid.view import view_config
    from pyramid.response import Response
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
    from asgiref.wsgi import WsgiToAsgi
    from starlette.middleware import Middleware

    # FastAPI Application
    fastapi_app = FastAPI(
        title="My FastAPI App",
        description="An example FastAPI app mounted in Pyramid",
        version="0.1.0",
        routes=[
            APIRoute("/hello", lambda: {"message": "Hello from FastAPI!"}),
            APIRoute("/items/{item_id}", lambda item_id: {"item_id": item_id}),
        ],
        middleware=[
            Middleware(lambda request, call_next: call_next(request))  # Just an example middleware
        ],
    )

    # Pyramid Views
    @view_config(route_name='pyramid_home', renderer='string')
    def pyramid_home_view(request):
        return "Hello from Pyramid!"

    # Pyramid Configuration
    def main(global_config, **settings):
        """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
        """
        with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
            config.add_route('pyramid_home', '/')
            config.include("pyramid_jinja2")
            config.scan('.')


            # Mount FastAPI using WsgiToAsgi.  This works but is NOT ideal for async ops.  Use ASGIAppWrapper.
            # fastapi_wsgi_app = WsgiToAsgi(fastapi_app) # Legacy approach, not recommended for async workloads

            # Better: Create a separate config and use it as a context for mounting the ASGI app:
            from pyramid.router import Router
            from pyramid.config import Configurator
            from pyramid.request import Request

            class ASGIAppWrapper:
                def __init__(self, asgi_app, context):
                    self.asgi_app = asgi_app
                    self.context = context

                async def __call__(self, scope, receive, send):
                    # ASGI-compliant call to the FastAPI application
                    scope["asgi.context"] = self.context # Set the Pyramid request context
                    await self.asgi_app(scope, receive, send)

            async def fastapi_mount_point(request: Request):
                # Create a scope object for the FastAPI app based on the Pyramid request
                scope = {
                    "type": "http",  # or "websocket"
                    "http_version": "1.1",
                    "method": request.method,
                    "path": request.path_info,
                    "query_string": request.query_string.encode("utf-8"),
                    "headers": [(k.encode("utf-8"), v.encode("utf-8")) for k, v in request.headers.items()],
                    "root_path": request.application_url, # Important for URL construction
                    "client": (request.remote_addr, request.remote_port) if request.remote_addr else None,
                    "server": (request.host.split(':')[0], int(request.host.split(':')[1]) if ':' in request.host else 80),
                    "asgi": {"version": "3.0", "spec_version": "2.3"},
                    "scheme": request.scheme, #http or https
                    "raw_path": request.path_info.encode('utf-8'), #Required. RFC 3986 encoded version of the URL path
                }

                # Wrap the FastAPI application for Pyramid routing
                asgi_wrapper = ASGIAppWrapper(fastapi_app, request.context)  # Pass request context to the wrapper

                # Call the ASGI app directly using the prepared scope, receive, and send
                await asgi_wrapper(scope, request.receive, request.send)

            # Create a router for ASGI routes.
            api_router = Router()
            api_router.add(r'/api/{_:path}', fastapi_mount_point)  # Catch-all for /api/

            # Mount it under the main config
            config.add_route('api', '/api/{_:path}')
            config.add_view(fastapi_mount_point, route_name='api')

            return config.make_wsgi_app()  # Correctly returns WSGI app for Uvicorn

    # For direct running via Uvicorn.  It's better to run via a dedicated deployment script.
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import uvicorn
        wsgi_app = main({})
        asgi_app = WsgiToAsgi(wsgi_app) # Convert it to an ASGI application for direct running, but this is NOT RECOMMENDED for production async.

        uvicorn.run(asgi_app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    ```plaintext
    python combined_app.py
    ```

    Or, if deploying using Uvicorn separately (better):

    ```plaintext
    # deploy.py
    import uvicorn
    from combined_app import main
    from asgiref.wsgi import WsgiToAsgi

    wsgi_app = main({}) # Create the Pyramid WSGI application

    # Convert WSGI to ASGI for Uvicorn
    asgi_app = WsgiToAsgi(wsgi_app) # This line converts it.  Use a dedicated deploy script.

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        uvicorn.run(asgi_app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)
    ```

    Then run:

    ```plaintext
    python deploy.py
    ```

4.  **Access the Applications:**

    - Pyramid: `http://localhost:8000/`
    - FastAPI: `http://localhost:8000/api/hello`
    - FastAPI Items: `http://localhost:8000/api/items/123`

**Explanation:**

- The `WsgiToAsgi` class converts the Pyramid WSGI application into an ASGI-compatible application. This allows Uvicorn (an ASGI server) to serve both Pyramid and FastAPI. **IMPORTANT:** This is a _legacy_ method, and not ideal for truly asynchronous operations. It basically runs the WSGI app in a thread pool.

- A more modern and performant approach (as demonstrated in the advanced code above) is to use an `ASGIAppWrapper` and directly invoke the FastAPI app from a Pyramid view function. This is more complex, but avoids the overhead of WsgiToAsgi.

- The Pyramid configuration now includes mounting the FastAPI application under the `/api` route.

- The `uvicorn.run` command serves the combined ASGI application.

**Advantages:**

- **Single deployment:** Only one application needs to be deployed.
- **Potentially better performance:** Direct invocation can have lower overhead compared to reverse proxying, especially if the Pyramid application doesn't already handle all the reverse proxy concerns.
- **Shared resources:** Both Pyramid and FastAPI can potentially share resources (e.g., database connections) within the same process.
- **Easier context sharing:** With the `ASGIAppWrapper` approach, passing data and the Pyramid request context to FastAPI becomes cleaner.

**Disadvantages:**

- **More complex implementation:** The integration process is more involved than using a reverse proxy.
- **Increased coupling:** Pyramid and FastAPI are more tightly coupled, which can make it harder to decouple them in the future.
- **Error handling:** Errors within the FastAPI application might affect the entire Pyramid application.
- **ASGI compatibility challenges:** Ensuring full ASGI compatibility and correct context propagation can be tricky, especially with older Pyramid versions or extensions.

## Key Considerations and Best Practices

- **Choose the Right Approach:** Carefully consider the pros and cons of each integration method before making a decision. If you have a large, existing Pyramid application, the reverse proxy approach might be simpler to implement. If you need maximum performance and tighter integration, the ASGI integration approach might be a better choice.

- **Handle Routing Carefully:** Ensure that your routing rules in Pyramid and FastAPI don't conflict with each other. Use clear and consistent URL prefixes (e.g., `/api` for FastAPI endpoints) to avoid confusion.

- **Context Sharing:** If you need to share data between Pyramid and FastAPI (e.g., user authentication information), consider using a shared session or a common database. The `ASGIAppWrapper` can help you properly pass the Pyramid request context.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement a consistent authentication and authorization mechanism across both Pyramid and FastAPI. Consider using a shared authentication library or a single sign-on (SSO) solution.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in both Pyramid and FastAPI to prevent errors in one application from affecting the other. Use appropriate logging and monitoring tools to track errors and performance.

- **Dependency Management:** Use a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of your Pyramid and FastAPI applications. This will prevent conflicts between different versions of the same package.

- **Testing:** Write thorough unit and integration tests to ensure that your hybrid application works correctly. Test both the Pyramid and FastAPI components individually, as well as the integration between them.

- **Deployment:** Choose a deployment strategy that is appropriate for your application. Consider using a containerization platform like Docker and Kubernetes to simplify deployment and scaling. When using ASGI, make sure your deployment platform supports it (e.g., Uvicorn, Hypercorn).

## Conclusion

Combining Pyramid and FastAPI can be a powerful way to build modern and scalable web applications in Python. By leveraging the strengths of each framework, you can create a hybrid application that is both robust and performant. Remember to choose the integration method that best suits your needs, and follow the best practices outlined in this post to ensure a successful implementation. Careful planning, thorough testing, and a clear understanding of the nuances of each framework are essential for building a reliable and maintainable hybrid application. Remember to always test and benchmark your applications to ensure that the integration meets your performance requirements. Good luck!
