# Drizzle ORM: A Modern TypeScript ORM for Building Performant Web Applications

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, choosing the right tools is crucial for building efficient and maintainable applications. Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) play a vital role in simplifying database interactions. Drizzle ORM is emerging as a compelling alternative to traditional ORMs, particularly for TypeScript developers seeking performance, type safety, and a great developer experience. This article provides an in-depth look at Drizzle ORM, its benefits, and how to use it effectively in your projects.

## What is Drizzle ORM?

Drizzle ORM is a modern, lightweight, and type-safe TypeScript ORM. Unlike many ORMs that rely on runtime reflection, Drizzle utilizes TypeScript's powerful type system to provide compile-time type safety, resulting in faster performance and fewer runtime errors. It aims to provide a close-to-SQL experience while offering the benefits of an ORM, such as schema management and query building.

**Key Features of Drizzle ORM:**

- **TypeScript-First:** Drizzle is built with TypeScript and leverages its type system to provide strong type safety throughout your data layer.
- **Lightweight and Performant:** Drizzle avoids runtime reflection, resulting in minimal overhead and efficient query execution. It compiles directly to SQL.
- **Close-to-SQL Experience:** Drizzle aims to provide an experience that feels familiar to SQL developers, allowing you to write queries that are similar to raw SQL but with the benefits of type safety and schema management.
- **Schema Migrations:** Drizzle provides a robust migration system to manage database schema changes, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Multiple Database Support:** Drizzle supports popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **Composability:** Drizzle provides utilities to compose complex queries from smaller, reusable parts.
- **Excellent Developer Experience:** Clean API, thorough documentation, and helpful error messages contribute to a smooth development process.

## Why Choose Drizzle Over Other ORMs?

While other ORMs like Prisma and TypeORM are popular choices, Drizzle offers some distinct advantages:

- **Performance:** Drizzle's compile-time type safety and avoidance of runtime reflection typically result in faster query execution compared to ORMs that rely on runtime operations.
- **Simplicity:** Drizzle has a smaller codebase and a more straightforward API than some other ORMs, making it easier to learn and use.
- **Control:** Drizzle provides more control over the generated SQL, allowing you to fine-tune queries for optimal performance. You're closer to the metal.
- **Type Safety:** Although other ORMs provide type safety, Drizzle's tight integration with TypeScript ensures strong type safety at compile time, catching errors before runtime.

## Getting Started with Drizzle ORM

Let's walk through the process of setting up Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. The steps are similar for MySQL and SQLite, but you'll need to install the appropriate database driver and adapter.

**1. Project Setup:**

Create a new Node.js project and initialize `npm`:

```plaintext
mkdir drizzle-example
cd drizzle-example
npm init -y
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

Install the necessary packages:

```plaintext
npm install drizzle-orm pg pg-promise dotenv typescript @types/node -D
```

- `drizzle-orm`: The core Drizzle ORM package.
- `pg`: The PostgreSQL driver for Node.js.
- `pg-promise`: (Optional, but recommended) A Promise-based interface for `pg` that simplifies query execution and transaction management.
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler.
- `@types/node`: TypeScript definitions for Node.js.

**3. Configure TypeScript:**

Initialize a TypeScript configuration file:

```plaintext
tsc --init
```

Modify `tsconfig.json` to configure the compiler options. Here's a recommended configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

**4. Create a `.env` file:**

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your database connection string:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
```

Replace `user`, `password`, and `database` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

**5. Define Your Schema:**

Create a `src/schema.ts` file to define your database schema using Drizzle's schema definition API:

```typescript
// src/schema.ts
import { pgTable, serial, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
})

export const posts = pgTable('posts', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  title: text('title').notNull(),
  content: text('content'),
  userId: serial('user_id').references(() => users.id),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
})

export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect // return type when queried
export type NewUser = typeof users.$inferInsert // insert type
export type Post = typeof posts.$inferSelect
export type NewPost = typeof posts.$inferInsert
```

This code defines two tables: `users` and `posts`, with their respective columns and relationships. `typeof users.$inferSelect` and `typeof users.$inferInsert` are utility types that automatically infer the TypeScript types for selecting and inserting data into the `users` table, respectively. This eliminates the need to manually define types and ensures type safety.

**6. Create a Database Connection:**

Create a `src/db.ts` file to establish a connection to your PostgreSQL database:

```typescript
// src/db.ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres'
import { Pool } from 'pg'
import * as schema from './schema'
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
})

export const db = drizzle(pool, { schema })
```

This code imports the `drizzle` function, creates a connection pool to your PostgreSQL database using the connection string from your `.env` file, and initializes the Drizzle ORM instance with the schema you defined in `src/schema.ts`. The `{schema}` part tells drizzle about the schema allowing it to understand relationships and types when creating queries.

**7. Generate Migrations (Optional, but Recommended):**

While Drizzle does not include a migration system in the core package, you can use a third-party library like `drizzle-kit` or `migrate`. This guide uses Drizzle Kit.

First, install `drizzle-kit`:

```plaintext
npm install -D drizzle-kit
```

Initialize Drizzle Kit:

```plaintext
npx drizzle-kit generate:pg --schema src/schema.ts --out migrations
```

This creates a `migrations` directory in your project.

Now, you can create a migration:

```plaintext
npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
```

This will analyze your schema and generate a new migration file containing the SQL code to update your database schema.

Finally, apply the migrations. You'll need a script for this. Add a script to your `package.json`:

```json
"migrate": "node -r dotenv/config scripts/migrate.ts"
```

Create `scripts/migrate.ts` file:

```typescript
import { migrate } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres/migrator'
import { db } from '../src/db'
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()

async function main() {
  console.log('Running migrations...')
  await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: 'migrations' })
  console.log('Migrations completed!')
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error('Migration failed!', err)
  process.exit(1)
})
```

Now run the migration:

```plaintext
npm run migrate
```

This will apply the generated migrations to your database, creating the tables defined in your schema.

**8. Querying the Database:**

Create a `src/index.ts` file to demonstrate how to query the database using Drizzle:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import { db } from './db'
import { users, posts } from './schema'
import { eq, like } from 'drizzle-orm'

async function main() {
  // Insert a new user
  const newUser = await db
    .insert(users)
    .values({
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    })
    .returning()

  console.log('Inserted new user:', newUser)

  // Insert a new post
  const newPost = await db
    .insert(posts)
    .values({
      title: 'My First Post',
      content: 'This is the content of my first post.',
      userId: newUser[0].id,
    })
    .returning()

  console.log('Inserted new post:', newPost)

  // Select all users
  const allUsers = await db.select().from(users)
  console.log('All users:', allUsers)

  // Select a user by ID
  const userById = await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, newUser[0].id))
  console.log('User by ID:', userById)

  // Select posts by title (using LIKE)
  const postsByTitle = await db.select().from(posts).where(like(posts.title, '%First%'))
  console.log('Posts by title:', postsByTitle)
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err)
})
```

This code demonstrates how to insert data, select data, and use the `eq` (equals) and `like` functions for filtering. It shows how Drizzle's type system ensures that you're using the correct types when interacting with the database.

**9. Run the Application:**

Compile the TypeScript code:

```plaintext
npm run tsc
```

Run the compiled JavaScript file:

```plaintext
node dist/index.js
```

You should see the results of the database operations printed to the console.

## Advanced Drizzle ORM Concepts

Beyond the basics, Drizzle ORM offers several advanced features for building more complex applications:

- **Relationships:** Drizzle supports defining relationships between tables using foreign keys. This is crucial for representing complex data structures. The example above uses relationships through the `userId` column in the `posts` table referencing `users.id`.
- **Transactions:** Drizzle provides a transaction API to ensure data consistency.

  ```typescript
  // Example of a transaction
  await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
      // Perform multiple database operations within the transaction
      await tx.insert(users).values({ name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' });
      await tx.insert(posts).values({ title: 'Alice's Post', content: '...', userId: 1 });

      // If any error occurs, the transaction will be rolled back
  });
  ```

- **Complex Queries:** Drizzle allows you to build complex queries using functions like `leftJoin`, `rightJoin`, `fullJoin`, `groupBy`, `orderBy`, and `limit`.

  ```typescript
  // Example of a complex query with joins and ordering
  const usersWithPosts = await db
    .select()
    .from(users)
    .leftJoin(posts, eq(users.id, posts.userId))
    .orderBy(users.name)
    .limit(10)
  ```

- **Raw SQL:** While Drizzle aims to abstract away the complexities of SQL, you can still execute raw SQL queries when needed.

  ```typescript
  // Example of executing a raw SQL query
  const result = await db.execute(sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${1}`)
  ```
