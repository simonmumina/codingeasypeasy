# Monitoring Flask Applications with Prometheus and Grafana using flask-prometheus-metrics

In today's software landscape, **observability** is paramount. Understanding the health and performance of your applications is critical for ensuring a smooth user experience, identifying bottlenecks, and quickly resolving issues. This blog post will guide you through setting up **Prometheus and Grafana** to monitor your **Flask** applications, leveraging the `flask-prometheus-metrics` library for seamless integration.

## Why Prometheus and Grafana?

- **Prometheus:** A powerful, open-source monitoring solution that scrapes metrics from your applications at regular intervals. It stores this data as time-series, allowing you to query and analyze performance trends over time.
- **Grafana:** A popular data visualization tool that connects to Prometheus (and other data sources) to create insightful dashboards. With Grafana, you can visualize your application's metrics, set up alerts, and gain a comprehensive overview of its health.
- **Flask-Prometheus-Metrics:** A Flask extension that simplifies the process of exposing metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format. It handles the plumbing, allowing you to focus on defining and collecting the right metrics for your application.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Pip:** The Python package installer.
- **Flask:** A Python web framework.
- **Prometheus:** Download and install Prometheus from the official website: [https://prometheus.io/](https://prometheus.io/)
- **Grafana:** Download and install Grafana from the official website: [https://grafana.com/](https://grafana.com/)

## Installation

1.  **Create a Flask project (if you don't already have one):**

    ```bash
    mkdir flask-prometheus-example
    cd flask-prometheus-example
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install Flask
    ```

2.  **Install `flask-prometheus-metrics`:**

    ```bash
    pip install flask-prometheus-metrics
    ```

## Implementing Metrics in Your Flask Application

Here's a basic example of how to use `flask-prometheus-metrics` to expose metrics:

```plaintext
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request
from prometheus_flask_metrics import PrometheusMetrics

app = Flask(__name__)
metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)

# static information as metric
metrics.info('app_info', 'Application info', version='1.0.3')

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/slow')
def slow_endpoint():
    import time
    time.sleep(2) # Simulate a slow endpoint
    return 'Slow Response!'

@app.route('/another')
@metrics.do_not_track()  # Exclude this endpoint from request metrics
def another_endpoint():
    return "Another Endpoint!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

**Explanation:**

- **`from prometheus_flask_metrics import PrometheusMetrics`:** Imports the necessary class.
- **`metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)`:** Initializes the `PrometheusMetrics` object, associating it with your Flask app. By default, this will expose an endpoint `/metrics` where Prometheus can scrape the metrics.
- **`metrics.info('app_info', 'Application info', version='1.0.3')`:** Creates a static information metric. Useful for identifying the version or other metadata about your application.
- **`@metrics.do_not_track()`:** This decorator can be used to exclude a specific route from being tracked by request-based metrics (e.g., request count, request duration). This is helpful for health check endpoints or other routes you don't need detailed metrics for.

This simple example already provides valuable metrics out-of-the-box, including:

- **`http_request_total`:** The total number of HTTP requests received.
- **`http_request_duration_seconds`:** The distribution of HTTP request durations.
- **`python_gc_objects_collected_total`:** Python garbage collector statistics.
- **`python_info`:** Python version information.
- **`process_cpu_seconds_total`:** Total CPU time spent by the process.
- **`process_resident_memory_bytes`:** Resident memory usage in bytes.

## Running the Flask Application

Save the above code as `app.py` and run it:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your Flask application will now be running. By default, the metrics endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:5000/metrics`. You can verify this by visiting the URL in your browser. You should see a large block of text in the Prometheus exposition format.

## Configuring Prometheus

Next, configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics endpoint of your Flask application. Edit the `prometheus.yml` file (typically located in the Prometheus installation directory). Add a new job to the `scrape_configs` section:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'flask_app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:5000'] # Or your app's address and port
```

**Explanation:**

- **`job_name: 'flask_app'`:** Assigns a name to this scrape job.
- **`static_configs`:** Specifies the targets to scrape.
- **`targets: ['localhost:5000']`:** Sets the target to your Flask application's address and port. Replace `localhost:5000` with the actual address if your application is running on a different machine or port.

Restart Prometheus for the changes to take effect. You can usually do this by killing the Prometheus process and restarting it. Check your Prometheus logs to make sure it's successfully scraping your Flask application. You can access the Prometheus UI at `http://localhost:9090` (or the address where you installed Prometheus). Navigate to "Status" -> "Targets" to confirm the "flask_app" job is up and healthy.

## Configuring Grafana

Now, let's set up Grafana to visualize the metrics.

1.  **Add Prometheus as a Data Source:**

    - Open Grafana in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).
    - Navigate to "Connections" -> "Data sources" and click "Add data source".
    - Select "Prometheus".
    - Enter the Prometheus server URL (usually `http://localhost:9090`).
    - Click "Save & test" to verify the connection.

2.  **Create a Dashboard:**
    - Click the "+" icon in the Grafana sidebar and select "Dashboard".
    - Click "Add new panel".
    - In the query editor, select the Prometheus data source you just configured.
    - Start typing Prometheus query (PromQL) to select the metric you want to visualize. For example, to visualize the number of HTTP requests over time, you can use the query `sum(rate(http_request_total[5m]))`.
    - Configure the panel's visualization options (e.g., graph type, title, axes labels).
    - Click "Apply" to save the panel.

**Example Grafana Dashboard Panels and PromQL Queries:**

- **Total HTTP Requests per Second:** `sum(rate(http_request_total[5m]))` (as a Graph)
- **Average Request Duration:** `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, path))` (as a Graph) _This calculates the 95th percentile of request durations._ (Replace `0.95` with `0.5` for median, `0.99` for 99th percentile, etc.)
- **HTTP Request Status Code Count:** `sum(rate(http_request_total{code=~"5.."}[5m])) by (code)` (as a Pie Chart) _This shows the number of 5xx (server error) responses._ You can change the regex `"5.."` to `"2.."` for 2xx (success) responses, `"4.."` for 4xx (client error) responses, etc.
- **Process Resident Memory Usage:** `process_resident_memory_bytes` (as a Gauge)
- **CPU Usage:** `rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])` (as a Graph)

Experiment with different PromQL queries and visualizations to create a dashboard that provides the insights you need. You can create multiple panels in a single dashboard. Save your dashboard to preserve your configuration. Grafana also offers pre-built dashboards that you can import. Look for dashboards designed for Flask or Python applications. These often contain common metrics and visualizations, providing a starting point for your monitoring setup.

## Custom Metrics

While `flask-prometheus-metrics` provides useful default metrics, you'll often want to define your own custom metrics to track specific aspects of your application's behavior. Here's how to do it:

```plaintext
# app.py (modified)
from flask import Flask
from prometheus_flask_metrics import PrometheusMetrics
from prometheus_client import Counter

app = Flask(__name__)
metrics = PrometheusMetrics(app)

# Define a custom counter metric
MY_CUSTOM_COUNTER = Counter('my_custom_metric', 'Description of my custom metric')

@app.route('/increment')
def increment_metric():
    MY_CUSTOM_COUNTER.inc()
    return "Metric incremented!"

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

**Explanation:**

- **`from prometheus_client import Counter`:** Imports the `Counter` class from the `prometheus_client` library (which is a dependency of `flask-prometheus-metrics`). Prometheus offers various metric types, including:
  - **Counter:** A cumulative metric that only increases or resets to zero on restart.
  - **Gauge:** A metric that can increase and decrease, representing a current value.
  - **Histogram:** A metric that samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. Useful for calculating quantiles.
  - **Summary:** Similar to a histogram but calculates quantiles directly within the application, which can be more accurate but also more resource-intensive.
- **`MY_CUSTOM_COUNTER = Counter('my_custom_metric', 'Description of my custom metric')`:** Creates a `Counter` object with a name (`my_custom_metric`) and a description.
- **`MY_CUSTOM_COUNTER.inc()`:** Increments the counter whenever the `/increment` endpoint is accessed.

To use this custom metric in Grafana, you would use the PromQL query `my_custom_metric`.

## More Advanced Usage

- **Authentication:** For production environments, secure your `/metrics` endpoint with authentication. You can use Flask's built-in authentication mechanisms or a library like `Flask-HTTPAuth`. Ensure Prometheus is configured to provide the necessary credentials when scraping.
- **Custom Collectors:** For more complex metric collection, you can create custom collectors that extend the functionality of `flask-prometheus-metrics`. Refer to the `prometheus_client` documentation for details.
- **Logging Integration:** Integrate your logging system with Prometheus by extracting metrics from your logs. This can provide valuable insights into application behavior and errors. Tools like `Fluentd` or `Logstash` can be used to process logs and send metrics to Prometheus.
- **Alerting:** Use Prometheus's alerting capabilities to automatically notify you of potential issues. Define alert rules based on your metrics and configure notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).
- **Docker and Kubernetes:** When deploying your Flask application in Docker or Kubernetes, configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics endpoint exposed by your container or pod. Use service discovery mechanisms to automatically update the Prometheus configuration when your application scales.

## Conclusion

By using `flask-prometheus-metrics` with Prometheus and Grafana, you can gain invaluable insights into the performance and health of your Flask applications. This comprehensive monitoring setup empowers you to proactively identify and resolve issues, optimize performance, and ensure a reliable and smooth user experience. Remember to tailor your metrics and dashboards to the specific needs of your application and continuously refine your monitoring strategy as your application evolves. Observability is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup!
