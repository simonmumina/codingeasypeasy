# Next.js Dynamic Routes: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Next.js is a powerful React framework that simplifies the development of server-rendered React applications. One of its key features is its robust routing system, and the ability to create *dynamic routes* is crucial for building complex and data-driven web applications like blogs, e-commerce sites, and documentation platforms. Dynamic routes allow you to create pages that are based on parameters in the URL, eliminating the need to create a separate file for each individual item.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of creating dynamic routes in Next.js, from basic setup to advanced techniques.

## What are Dynamic Routes?

Dynamic routes in Next.js allow you to create pages based on dynamic parameters in the URL.  Instead of creating individual files for each blog post, you can have a single `[slug].js` or `[id].js` file that handles all blog posts, where `slug` or `id` is a dynamic parameter extracted from the URL.  This makes your code more maintainable and scalable.

**Example:**

Instead of having files like:

*   `pages/blog/post-1.js`
*   `pages/blog/post-2.js`
*   `pages/blog/post-3.js`

You can have a single file:

*   `pages/blog/[slug].js`

And the `slug` will dynamically change based on the URL, for example:

*   `/blog/post-1`
*   `/blog/post-2`
*   `/blog/post-3`

## Setting up Dynamic Routes in Next.js

Here's how to create a dynamic route in Next.js:

1.  **Create a Directory Structure:**  Inside your `pages` directory, create a directory for your route.  For example, if you want to create dynamic routes for blog posts, create a `blog` directory: `pages/blog/`.

2.  **Create the Dynamic Route File:** Within the `blog` directory, create a file named `[slug].js` or `[id].js`. The square brackets `[]` indicate that this is a dynamic route segment. You can name the file whatever you want; the part inside the brackets becomes the parameter name.

    **Important:** The filename must be wrapped in square brackets `[]`. This tells Next.js that it's a dynamic route.

3.  **Implement the Page Component:** Inside `[slug].js` or `[id].js`, create a React component that will render the page. You can access the dynamic route parameter using the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`.

    ```javascript
    // pages/blog/[slug].js
    import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

    function BlogPost() {
      const router = useRouter();
      const { slug } = router.query;

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Blog Post: {slug}</h1>
          <p>This is the content for the blog post with slug: {slug}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default BlogPost;
    ```

    In this example, `router.query.slug` contains the value of the `slug` parameter from the URL. If you visit `/blog/my-first-post`, `router.query.slug` will be equal to `"my-first-post"`.

## Fetching Data Based on Dynamic Routes

Often, you'll want to fetch data based on the dynamic route parameter.  For example, you might want to fetch a blog post from a database based on its slug.  There are three main ways to fetch data in Next.js with dynamic routes:

*   **`getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` (Static Site Generation - SSG):** This is the recommended approach for most use cases, especially if your data doesn't change frequently.
*   **`getServerSideProps` (Server-Side Rendering - SSR):**  Use this if you need to fetch data on every request, for example, if your data is highly personalized or changes very rapidly.
*   **Client-Side Data Fetching:** Fetch the data in the component using `useEffect` and the `useRouter` hook.  This is generally not recommended for initial page load due to SEO implications, but can be useful for updating data after the page has loaded.

### 1. `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` (SSG)

This approach is ideal for blog posts, documentation, and other content that doesn't change frequently.  Next.js will generate the pages at build time, resulting in faster load times and improved SEO.

*   **`getStaticPaths`:** This function defines which paths should be statically generated.  It should return an array of `paths` and a `fallback` option.
*   **`getStaticProps`:** This function fetches the data for each specific path defined in `getStaticPaths`. It receives the `params` object, which contains the dynamic route parameters.

    ```javascript
    // pages/blog/[slug].js
    import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

    function BlogPost({ post }) {
      const router = useRouter();

      // If the page is not yet generated, this will be displayed
      // initially until getStaticProps finishes running
      if (router.isFallback) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{post.title}</h1>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      // Replace this with your data fetching logic
      const posts = [
        { slug: 'my-first-post' },
        { slug: 'my-second-post' },
        { slug: 'my-third-post' },
      ];

      const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
        params: { slug: post.slug },
      }));

      return {
        paths,
        fallback: false, // or 'blocking' or true (see below)
      };
    }

    export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
      const { slug } = params;

      // Replace this with your data fetching logic
      const post = {
        slug: slug,
        title: `Title of ${slug}`,
        content: `Content of ${slug}`,
      };

      return {
        props: {
          post,
        },
      };
    }

    export default BlogPost;
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   **`getStaticPaths`:**  This function fetches a list of all possible `slug` values from your data source (e.g., a database, CMS, or Markdown files). It then creates an array of `paths` objects, where each object specifies the `params` for a given `slug`.  The `fallback` option determines what happens when a user visits a route that hasn't been statically generated:
        *   `fallback: false`:  Returns a 404 page if the route hasn't been pre-generated.
        *   `fallback: true`:  Next.js will serve a fallback page (defined by checking `router.isFallback`) while it generates the page in the background. Subsequent requests for the same route will serve the statically generated page. This is useful for large datasets where generating all pages at build time is too slow.
        *   `fallback: 'blocking'`: Similar to `fallback: true`, but Next.js will wait for the page to be generated before serving it to the user.  The user won't see the fallback page. This can improve the user experience, but it might result in slightly longer initial load times.

    *   **`getStaticProps`:** This function fetches the data for a specific blog post based on the `slug` parameter.  It retrieves the `slug` from the `params` object and uses it to fetch the corresponding post data.  The fetched data is then passed as props to the `BlogPost` component.

    **Important Considerations for `getStaticPaths`:**

    *   **Complete Data Set:** Ensure `getStaticPaths` returns all possible paths. If you add a new blog post and don't update `getStaticPaths`, the new post won't be statically generated.
    *   **Large Datasets:** For large datasets, consider using `fallback: true` or `fallback: 'blocking'` to avoid long build times.

### 2. `getServerSideProps` (SSR)

This approach renders the page on each request.  It's useful for dynamic data that changes frequently or data that is personalized for each user.

```javascript
// pages/blog/[slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { slug } = context.params;

  // Replace this with your data fetching logic
  const post = {
    slug: slug,
    title: `Title of ${slug}`,
    content: `Content of ${slug}`,
  };

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}

export default BlogPost;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`getServerSideProps`:**  This function runs on the server on every request.  It receives a `context` object that contains the `params` object, which holds the dynamic route parameters.  It fetches the data based on the `slug` and passes it as props to the `BlogPost` component.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **Slower Load Times:** SSR results in slower initial load times compared to SSG, as the page needs to be rendered on the server for each request.
*   **Dynamic Data:** Ideal for dynamic data and personalized content.
*   **No `getStaticPaths`:** You don't need `getStaticPaths` with `getServerSideProps` because the page is rendered on demand.

### 3. Client-Side Data Fetching

This involves fetching data in the component using `useEffect` and the `useRouter` hook.

```javascript
// pages/blog/[slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;
  const [post, setPost] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (slug) {
      // Replace this with your data fetching logic
      const fetchPost = async () => {
        // Simulating an API call
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Simulate latency
        const fetchedPost = {
          slug: slug,
          title: `Title of ${slug}`,
          content: `Content of ${slug}`,
        };
        setPost(fetchedPost);
      };

      fetchPost();
    }
  }, [slug]);

  if (!post) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogPost;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`useRouter`:** Gets the `slug` from the router query.
*   **`useEffect`:**  Fetches the data when the `slug` changes.
*   **`useState`:**  Stores the fetched post data.

**Trade-offs:**

*   **SEO Issues:**  This approach can negatively impact SEO as the content is rendered on the client-side.  Search engine crawlers might not be able to index the content properly.
*   **Initial Loading State:**  The user will see a loading state initially.
*   **Flexibility:**  Useful for situations where you need to update data after the initial page load or for adding client-side interactivity.

## Advanced Techniques: Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update statically generated pages *after* you've built your site. This combines the benefits of static generation (fast load times, SEO) with the ability to update content without redeploying your entire site.

To use ISR, add the `revalidate` option to your `getStaticProps` function:

```javascript
// pages/blog/[slug].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function BlogPost({ post }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  if (router.isFallback) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // ... (same as before)
  const posts = [
    { slug: 'my-first-post' },
    { slug: 'my-second-post' },
    { slug: 'my-third-post' },
  ];

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { slug } = params;

  // Replace this with your data fetching logic
  const post = {
    slug: slug,
    title: `Title of ${slug}`,
    content: `Content of ${slug}`,
  };

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
    revalidate: 10, // Re-generate the page every 10 seconds
  };
}

export default BlogPost;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`revalidate: 10`:**  This tells Next.js to re-generate the page in the background every 10 seconds.  When a user requests the page, they'll get the statically generated version.  If the page has been re-generated in the background since the last request, they'll get the updated version. If not, they will still get the old cached page while the new one is generated in the background.

**Benefits of ISR:**

*   **Fast Load Times:**  Serves statically generated content to users, resulting in fast load times.
*   **Near Real-Time Updates:**  Allows you to update content without redeploying your entire site.
*   **Improved SEO:**  Search engines crawl statically generated content, improving SEO.

## Dynamic Route Matching Order

Next.js uses a specific order to match routes:

1.  **Static Routes:**  Exact matches for files in the `pages` directory (e.g., `pages/about.js`).
2.  **Dynamic Routes:**  Routes with dynamic segments (e.g., `pages/blog/[slug].js`).
3.  **Catch-All Routes:** Routes that match any path (e.g., `pages/[...slug].js`).

**Example:**

If you have the following files:

*   `pages/about.js`
*   `pages/blog/[slug].js`
*   `pages/[...slug].js`

The following URLs would be matched as follows:

*   `/about`: Matches `pages/about.js` (static route).
*   `/blog/my-post`: Matches `pages/blog/[slug].js` (dynamic route).
*   `/some/deep/path`: Matches `pages/[...slug].js` (catch-all route).

## Catch-All Routes

Catch-all routes are dynamic routes that can match any number of path segments. They are created by wrapping the parameter name in double square brackets: `[[...paramName]].js`.

```javascript
// pages/products/[[...params]].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function Products() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { params } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <p>Params: {JSON.stringify(params)}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Products;
```

**Examples:**

*   `/products` -> `params` will be `undefined`
*   `/products/shoes` -> `params` will be `['shoes']`
*   `/products/shoes/red` -> `params` will be `['shoes', 'red']`

## Optional Catch-All Routes

Optional catch-all routes are similar to catch-all routes, but they also match the route without any segments. They are created by wrapping the parameter name in double square brackets and including the `optional` keyword: `[[...paramName]]`.

**Important:** From NextJS 13, you can simply use the `[[...paramName]]` syntax without the need for an optional keyword.

## Tips and Best Practices

*   **Clear Directory Structure:** Maintain a clean and organized directory structure for your routes.
*   **Descriptive File Names:** Use descriptive file names for your dynamic route files.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling in your `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` functions to handle cases where data is not found.
*   **Loading States:**  Display loading states to provide a better user experience while data is being fetched.
*   **SEO Optimization:**  Use appropriate HTML tags and meta descriptions to optimize your dynamic routes for search engines.
*   **Consider Caching:** Utilize caching strategies to improve performance and reduce database load.

## Conclusion

Dynamic routes are a powerful feature in Next.js that allows you to build flexible and scalable web applications. By understanding the different approaches for creating and using dynamic routes, you can create a more efficient and maintainable codebase. Choose the appropriate data fetching method based on your specific needs and consider using ISR for content that needs to be updated regularly without requiring a full redeployment.  Remember to optimize your routes for SEO and provide a good user experience. Good luck!
