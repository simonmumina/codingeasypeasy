# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around "objects," which contain data and code to manipulate that data.  Java is a quintessential object-oriented language. Understanding OOP principles is crucial for writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. This guide provides a deep dive into OOP concepts in Java, complete with code examples.

## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP aims to model real-world entities as objects in software.  This approach promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.  The core principles of OOP are:

*   **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on that data within a single unit (class).
*   **Inheritance:**  Creating new classes (subclasses) based on existing classes (superclasses), inheriting their properties and behaviors.
*   **Polymorphism:**  The ability of an object to take on many forms.  This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.
*   **Abstraction:**  Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information to the user.

Let's explore each of these principles in detail with Java examples.

## 1. Encapsulation: Bundling Data and Methods

Encapsulation protects data from unauthorized access and modification. It achieves this by making the data members of a class `private` and providing `public` methods (getters and setters) to access and modify them.

**Example:**

```java
public class BankAccount {

    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public String getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposit successful. New balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid deposit amount.");
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrawal successful. New balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance or invalid withdrawal amount.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount("1234567890", 1000);
        System.out.println("Account Number: " + myAccount.getAccountNumber());
        System.out.println("Balance: " + myAccount.getBalance());
        myAccount.deposit(500);
        myAccount.withdraw(200);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `accountNumber` and `balance` are declared as `private`.  This prevents direct access from outside the `BankAccount` class.
*   `getAccountNumber()` and `getBalance()` are getter methods that provide read-only access to the data.
*   `deposit()` and `withdraw()` are setter methods that control how the `balance` is modified, ensuring data integrity.  They include validation to prevent invalid operations.

**Benefits of Encapsulation:**

*   **Data Hiding:** Prevents unauthorized access and modification of data.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensures that data is modified in a controlled manner through methods.
*   **Modularity:** Makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

## 2. Inheritance: Creating New Classes from Existing Ones

Inheritance allows you to create new classes (subclasses or derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes).  The subclass inherits the properties and behaviors of the superclass, and you can add new properties and behaviors or override existing ones.

**Example:**

```java
class Animal {
    String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Generic animal sound");
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    String breed;

    public Dog(String name, String breed) {
        super(name); // Call the constructor of the superclass
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!"); // Overriding the makeSound method
    }

    public String getBreed() {
        return breed;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
        System.out.println("Name: " + myDog.getName());
        System.out.println("Breed: " + myDog.getBreed());
        myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof!

        Animal myAnimal = new Animal("Generic Animal");
        myAnimal.makeSound(); //Output: Generic animal sound
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public Cat(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow!"); // Overriding the makeSound method
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`.  It inherits the `name` property and the `makeSound()` and `getName()` methods.
*   The `super(name)` call in the `Dog` constructor calls the constructor of the `Animal` class to initialize the `name` property.
*   The `@Override` annotation indicates that the `makeSound()` method in the `Dog` class is overriding the `makeSound()` method in the `Animal` class.  This is an example of method overriding.
*   A `Cat` class is also created extending `Animal`, showing another example of inheritance and method overriding.

**Benefits of Inheritance:**

*   **Code Reusability:**  Avoids redundant code by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes.
*   **Extensibility:**  Allows you to extend the functionality of existing classes without modifying them directly.
*   **Hierarchy:**  Creates a hierarchical relationship between classes, making the code more organized.

## 3. Polymorphism: Many Forms

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This is achieved through two main mechanisms:

*   **Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism):** We saw this in the inheritance example above. The `makeSound()` method is overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes, allowing objects of these classes to exhibit different behavior when the same method is called.
*   **Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism):**  Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.

**Example of Method Overloading:**

```java
class Calculator {

    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calculator.add(2, 3));       // Output: 5
        System.out.println(calculator.add(2.5, 3.5));   // Output: 6.0
        System.out.println(calculator.add(2, 3, 4));    // Output: 9
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `Calculator` class has three `add()` methods with different parameter lists.
*   The compiler determines which `add()` method to call based on the arguments passed to the method.

**Polymorphism with Interfaces:**

Polymorphism is also achieved through interfaces.  An interface defines a contract that classes can implement.  Objects of different classes that implement the same interface can be treated as objects of that interface type.

```java
interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    double width;
    double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class PolymorphismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5);
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);

        System.out.println("Circle area: " + circle.calculateArea());
        System.out.println("Rectangle area: " + rectangle.calculateArea());

        // Example of polymorphism: treating different Shape objects the same way.
        Shape[] shapes = {circle, rectangle};
        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            System.out.println("Area: " + shape.calculateArea());
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `Shape` interface defines a `calculateArea()` method.
*   The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes implement the `Shape` interface, providing their own implementations of the `calculateArea()` method.
*   Objects of `Circle` and `Rectangle` can be treated as `Shape` objects, allowing you to call the `calculateArea()` method on them regardless of their specific type.

**Benefits of Polymorphism:**

*   **Flexibility:** Allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types in a uniform way.
*   **Extensibility:** Makes it easy to add new classes that implement the same interface without modifying existing code.
*   **Code Reusability:** Promotes code reusability by allowing you to write generic code that can work with objects of different types.

## 4. Abstraction: Hiding Implementation Details

Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential information to the user. It simplifies the interaction with objects by providing a high-level view of their functionality. Java provides abstract classes and interfaces to achieve abstraction.

**Abstract Classes:**

An abstract class cannot be instantiated. It can contain both abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods (methods with implementation). Subclasses must implement the abstract methods of the abstract class.

**Example:**

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    String modelName;

    public Vehicle(String modelName) {
        this.modelName = modelName;
    }

    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void startEngine();

    // Concrete method (with implementation)
    public void displayModelName() {
        System.out.println("Model Name: " + modelName);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String modelName) {
        super(modelName);
    }

    @Override
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Car engine started.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota Camry");
        myCar.displayModelName(); // Output: Model Name: Toyota Camry
        myCar.startEngine();      // Output: Car engine started.
    }
}

```

**Explanation:**

*   `Vehicle` is an abstract class with an abstract method `startEngine()`.
*   `Car` is a subclass of `Vehicle` and must implement the `startEngine()` method.
*   You cannot create an instance of the `Vehicle` class directly.  `Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();` would result in a compile error.

**Interfaces (Abstraction):**

An interface defines a contract that classes can implement. All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract.

```java
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

class Circle2 implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square");
    }
}

public class AbstractionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Drawable circle = new Circle2();
        Drawable square = new Square();

        circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle
        square.draw(); // Output: Drawing a square
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Drawable` is an interface with a `draw()` method.
*   `Circle2` and `Square` implement the `Drawable` interface and provide their own implementations of the `draw()` method.

**Benefits of Abstraction:**

*   **Simplicity:** Simplifies complex systems by hiding implementation details.
*   **Modularity:** Makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows you to change the implementation without affecting the client code.
