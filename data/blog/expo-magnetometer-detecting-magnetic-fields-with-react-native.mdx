The Expo Magnetometer is a powerful tool for React Native developers looking to integrate magnetic field sensing into their applications. Whether you're building a compass, a metal detector, or simply want to explore the Earth's magnetic field, the `expo-sensors` package provides a simple and reliable way to access magnetometer data.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with the Expo Magnetometer, from installation and setup to data interpretation and practical use cases.

## What is a Magnetometer?

A magnetometer is a sensor that measures the strength and direction of magnetic fields. In smartphones, it's primarily used for compass functionality, navigation, and augmented reality applications. Understanding the readings from a magnetometer can unlock a variety of features in your React Native apps.

## Why Use Expo Magnetometer?

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Expo simplifies cross-platform development, ensuring your magnetometer code works seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
- **Easy Setup:** The `expo-sensors` package provides a straightforward API, making it easy to integrate magnetometer functionality into your React Native project.
- **Simplified Permissions:** Expo handles the complexities of requesting and managing sensor permissions on different platforms.
- **Real-Time Data:** Access real-time magnetic field data with consistent updates, allowing for interactive and responsive applications.

## Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Before you can start using the Expo Magnetometer, you need to install the `expo-sensors` package. This can be done using either `npm` or `yarn`.

**Using npm:**

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-sensors
```

**Using yarn:**

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-sensors
```

**Importing the Magnetometer:**

Once the package is installed, you can import the `Magnetometer` module into your React Native component:

```plaintext
import { Magnetometer } from 'expo-sensors'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
```

## Basic Usage: Accessing Magnetometer Data

The `Magnetometer` module provides several methods for accessing magnetic field data. The most common approach is to use the `Magnetometer.addListener` method to subscribe to updates.

Here's a basic example of how to access and display magnetometer data in a React Native component:

```plaintext
import { Magnetometer } from 'expo-sensors'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function MagnetometerExample() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    z: 0,
  })
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    subscribe()
    return () => unsubscribe()
  }, [])

  const subscribe = () => {
    setSubscription(
      Magnetometer.addListener((magnetometerData) => {
        setData(magnetometerData)
      })
    )
  }

  const unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove()
    setSubscription(null)
  }

  const { x, y, z } = data

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Magnetometer Data:</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>X: {x}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Y: {y}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Z: {z}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
    marginVertical: 5,
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** Import `Magnetometer` from `expo-sensors`, `useState`, `useEffect` from `react`, and basic UI components from `react-native`.
2.  **State management:** `useState` is used to store the magnetometer data (x, y, z values) and the subscription object.
3.  **`useEffect` Hook:**
    - The `useEffect` hook is used to subscribe to magnetometer updates when the component mounts.
    - It also returns a cleanup function that unsubscribes from the magnetometer updates when the component unmounts. This is crucial to prevent memory leaks.
4.  **`subscribe` function:**
    - This function uses `Magnetometer.addListener` to start listening for magnetometer data.
    - The callback function receives the magnetometer data and updates the state using `setData`.
5.  **`unsubscribe` function:**
    - This function removes the subscription to stop listening for magnetometer data.
6.  **Rendering:** The component renders the magnetometer data (x, y, and z values) in a simple UI.

## Understanding Magnetometer Data

The `Magnetometer.addListener` method returns an object with three properties:

- **`x`:** Magnetic field strength in the x-axis (microteslas).
- **`y`:** Magnetic field strength in the y-axis (microteslas).
- **`z`:** Magnetic field strength in the z-axis (microteslas).

These values represent the components of the magnetic field vector in three-dimensional space. The units are typically in microteslas (ÂµT). The values are _relative_ to the device's orientation. This means that changing the device's orientation will affect the x, y, and z values.

**Interpreting the data requires understanding the coordinate system:**

- Imagine your phone lying flat on a table.
- **X-axis:** Positive X is typically to the right of the screen.
- **Y-axis:** Positive Y is typically towards the top of the screen.
- **Z-axis:** Positive Z points out of the screen.

## Advanced Usage: Controlling the Update Interval

You can control the update interval of the magnetometer using the `Magnetometer.setUpdateInterval` method. This method allows you to specify the interval in milliseconds. A smaller interval will result in more frequent updates, but it will also consume more battery power.

```plaintext
import { Magnetometer } from 'expo-sensors'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function MagnetometerExample() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    z: 0,
  })
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      Magnetometer.setUpdateInterval(200) // Set update interval to 200 milliseconds
      subscribe()
    })()

    return () => unsubscribe()
  }, [])

  const subscribe = () => {
    setSubscription(
      Magnetometer.addListener((magnetometerData) => {
        setData(magnetometerData)
      })
    )
  }

  const unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove()
    setSubscription(null)
  }

  const { x, y, z } = data

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Magnetometer Data:</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>X: {x}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Y: {y}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Z: {z}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
    marginVertical: 5,
  },
})
```

In this example, the update interval is set to 200 milliseconds. Choosing an appropriate update interval is crucial for balancing responsiveness and battery life.

## Practical Applications

The Expo Magnetometer can be used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Compass:** Determine the direction of the Earth's magnetic field to create a compass app. This requires calibrating the sensor and potentially compensating for hard iron and soft iron interferences.
- **Metal Detector:** Detect the presence of metal objects by measuring changes in the magnetic field. Sensitivity will be limited by the magnetometer's accuracy and environmental magnetic noise.
- **Navigation:** Integrate magnetometer data with GPS data to improve navigation accuracy, especially in areas where GPS signals are weak.
- **Gaming:** Create immersive gaming experiences by using magnetic field data to control in-game actions.
- **Augmented Reality:** Enhance AR experiences by using magnetometer data to track the device's orientation in the real world.

## Example: Building a Simple Compass

Here's a simplified example of how to use the magnetometer data to create a basic compass. This example does _not_ include calibration or declination correction, which would be necessary for a real-world compass application.

```plaintext
import { Magnetometer } from 'expo-sensors'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Image } from 'react-native'

export default function CompassExample() {
  const [heading, setHeading] = useState(0)
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    subscribe()
    return () => unsubscribe()
  }, [])

  const subscribe = () => {
    setSubscription(
      Magnetometer.addListener((data) => {
        let { x, y, z } = data

        // Calculate heading (in radians)
        let angle = Math.atan2(y, x)

        // Convert to degrees
        let degree = angle * (180 / Math.PI)

        // Adjust for negative values and rotate to match compass direction
        degree = (degree + 360) % 360

        setHeading(degree)
      })
    )
  }

  const unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove()
    setSubscription(null)
  }

  const rotate = heading + 'deg'

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Heading: {Math.round(heading)}Â°</Text>
      <Image
        source={require('./assets/compass.png')} // Replace with your compass image
        style={[styles.compassImage, { transform: [{ rotate: rotate }] }]}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  compassImage: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    resizeMode: 'contain',
  },
})
```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

- **Heading Calculation:** The code now correctly calculates the heading using `Math.atan2(y, x)`. `atan2` handles all quadrants correctly, avoiding issues with angles wrapping around.
- **Degrees Conversion:** The angle in radians is converted to degrees.
- **Normalization:** The heading is normalized to a range of 0-360 degrees using `(degree + 360) % 360`. This ensures that the heading is always a positive value.
- **Rotation Transformation:** The `rotate` variable is used to dynamically rotate the compass image based on the heading.
- **Image Integration:** The example now includes an `Image` component to display a compass image. You'll need to replace `'./assets/compass.png'` with the actual path to your compass image. Remember to import the image at the top if using a modern JS bundler that supports it.

**Important Considerations for a Real Compass:**

- **Calibration:** Magnetometers are susceptible to interference from nearby metal objects and electronic devices. Proper calibration is essential for accurate readings. The phone's operating system usually handles basic calibration, but more sophisticated calibration techniques may be needed.
- **Declination Correction:** The Earth's magnetic north pole is not the same as the geographic north pole. Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. You'll need to use a declination service or database to correct for this difference, based on the user's location.
- **Hard Iron and Soft Iron Interference:** These are types of magnetic interference that can distort magnetometer readings. Hard iron interference is caused by permanent magnets in the device, while soft iron interference is caused by materials that become magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. Advanced calibration algorithms are required to compensate for these effects.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permissions:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the magnetometer. Expo should handle this automatically, but it's good to be aware of.
- **Simulator vs. Real Device:** Magnetometer data may not be available in all simulators. Testing on a real device is recommended.
- **Accuracy:** Magnetometer accuracy can vary depending on the device and environmental conditions. Calibration and filtering techniques may be necessary to improve accuracy.
- **Battery Consumption:** Frequent magnetometer updates can consume significant battery power. Adjust the update interval as needed to balance responsiveness and battery life.

## Conclusion

The Expo Magnetometer provides a simple and powerful way to access magnetic field data in your React Native applications. By understanding the basics of magnetometer data and applying the techniques described in this guide, you can create innovative and engaging applications that leverage the power of magnetic field sensing. Remember to consider calibration and declination correction for real-world applications requiring accurate compass readings.
