# Why Is My @Transactional Method Not Rolling Back in Spring Boot? Common Causes and Solutions

Spring Boot's `@Transactional` annotation is a powerful tool for managing database transactions. It allows you to group multiple database operations into a single atomic unit of work. If any operation within the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring data consistency. However, developers often encounter situations where `@Transactional` methods fail to rollback as expected, leading to data inconsistencies and unexpected behavior. This post will explore common reasons why your `@Transactional` method might not be rolling back in Spring Boot and provide solutions with code examples.

## Understanding Spring's Transactional Behavior

Before diving into troubleshooting, let's recap how Spring's declarative transaction management works:

- **Declarative Transaction Management:** Spring AOP intercepts calls to methods annotated with `@Transactional`. It begins a transaction before the method execution and commits or rolls back the transaction after the method execution, depending on the outcome.

- **Default Rollback Rules:** By default, Spring rolls back a transaction only when an **unchecked exception** (a subclass of `RuntimeException` or `Error`) is thrown. Checked exceptions (subclasses of `Exception`, excluding `RuntimeException`) do **not** trigger a rollback by default.

- **AOP Proxy:** Spring uses AOP to create a proxy around the bean where the `@Transactional` method is defined. The proxy handles the transaction lifecycle.

## Common Causes for Rollback Failures

Here are some of the most common reasons why your `@Transactional` method might not be rolling back:

### 1. Catching Exceptions and Not Rethrowing

This is probably the most frequent culprit. If you catch an exception within your `@Transactional` method and don't rethrow it, Spring won't know that an error occurred and will commit the transaction.

**Example (Incorrect):**

```plaintext
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void processData(String data) {
        try {
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
            // Simulate an error
            if (data.equals("error")) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid data");
            }
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity("success"));

        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // Log the error, but don't rethrow it
            System.err.println("Error processing data: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, if `data` is "error," an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown, but it's caught and the transaction _will not_ be rolled back. The `myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data))` will be committed.

**Solution:**

Rethrow the exception after logging it or wrap it in a `RuntimeException`.

```plaintext
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void processData(String data) {
        try {
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
            // Simulate an error
            if (data.equals("error")) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid data");
            }
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity("success"));

        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // Log the error
            System.err.println("Error processing data: " + e.getMessage());
            // Rethrow the exception
            throw new RuntimeException("Error processing data", e); // Or simply 'throw e;' if a RuntimeException
        }
    }
}
```

Now, Spring will receive the `RuntimeException` (or re-thrown `IllegalArgumentException` if that was already a `RuntimeException`) and trigger the rollback.

### 2. Using Checked Exceptions Without Configuration

As mentioned earlier, Spring doesn't automatically rollback for checked exceptions.

**Example:**

```plaintext
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void processData(String data) throws IOException {
        try {
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
            // Simulate an error with a checked exception
            if (data.equals("error")) {
                throw new IOException("File operation failed");
            }
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity("success"));

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing data: " + e.getMessage());
            throw e; // Rethrowing the exception, but it's a checked exception
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, the `IOException` will _not_ cause a rollback by default.

**Solution:**

You can configure the `@Transactional` annotation to rollback on specific checked exceptions using the `rollbackFor` or `rollbackForClassName` attributes.

```plaintext
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Transactional(rollbackFor = IOException.class) // Or rollbackForClassName = {"java.io.IOException"}
    public void processData(String data) throws IOException {
        try {
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
            // Simulate an error with a checked exception
            if (data.equals("error")) {
                throw new IOException("File operation failed");
            }
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity("success"));

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing data: " + e.getMessage());
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

Or, you can use `noRollbackFor` to exclude specific exceptions.

### 3. Calling @Transactional Methods From Within the Same Class (Self-Invocation)

This is a tricky one. When you call a `@Transactional` method from another method within the same class, the AOP proxy isn't invoked. This means the transaction is never started in the first place, so there's nothing to rollback. This is because the call is made directly on the object, not through the proxy.

**Example:**

```plaintext
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    public void outerMethod(String data) {
        try {
            innerTransactionalMethod(data);  // Direct call to the method, not through the proxy
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error in outer method: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    @Transactional
    public void innerTransactionalMethod(String data) {
        myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
        if (data.equals("error")) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error in transactional method");
        }
        myRepository.save(new MyEntity("success"));
    }
}
```

In this scenario, `innerTransactionalMethod` is annotated with `@Transactional`, but because it's called directly from `outerMethod` within the same class, Spring's AOP proxy isn't involved, and the transaction won't be managed as expected.

**Solutions:**

- **Refactor into a Separate Bean:** The best approach is to move the `innerTransactionalMethod` to a separate `@Service` or `@Component`. This will force Spring to use the proxy when calling the method.

  ```plaintext
  @Service
  public class MyService {

      @Autowired
      private MyTransactionalService myTransactionalService;

      public void outerMethod(String data) {
          try {
              myTransactionalService.innerTransactionalMethod(data);
          } catch (Exception e) {
              System.err.println("Error in outer method: " + e.getMessage());
          }
      }
  }

  @Service
  public class MyTransactionalService {

      @Autowired
      private MyRepository myRepository;

      @Transactional
      public void innerTransactionalMethod(String data) {
          myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
          if (data.equals("error")) {
              throw new RuntimeException("Error in transactional method");
          }
          myRepository.save(new MyEntity("success"));
      }
  }
  ```

- **ApplicationContext.getBean() (Generally Not Recommended):** You can obtain a reference to the current bean from the `ApplicationContext` and call the transactional method through that reference. This forces the proxy to be used, but it's generally considered a code smell and makes your code more tightly coupled to the Spring container.

  ```plaintext
  @Service
  public class MyService implements ApplicationContextAware {

      @Autowired
      private MyRepository myRepository;

      private ApplicationContext applicationContext;

      @Override
      public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
          this.applicationContext = applicationContext;
      }

      public void outerMethod(String data) {
          try {
              ((MyService) applicationContext.getBean("myService")).innerTransactionalMethod(data); // Explicitly getting the bean and calling the method
          } catch (Exception e) {
              System.err.println("Error in outer method: " + e.getMessage());
          }
      }

      @Transactional
      public void innerTransactionalMethod(String data) {
          myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
          if (data.equals("error")) {
              throw new RuntimeException("Error in transactional method");
          }
          myRepository.save(new MyEntity("success"));
      }
  }
  ```

  **Important Note:** Using `ApplicationContext.getBean()` is generally discouraged because it introduces a direct dependency on the Spring container and can make your code harder to test. The preferred solution is to refactor your code to avoid self-invocation.

### 4. Incorrect Transaction Propagation

Transaction propagation defines how transactions should be handled when multiple `@Transactional` methods call each other. Using the wrong propagation level can prevent rollbacks.

Common Propagation Levels:

- **REQUIRED (Default):** If a transaction exists, join it. If not, create a new one.
- **REQUIRES_NEW:** Always creates a new transaction. If a transaction already exists, it's suspended.
- **SUPPORTS:** If a transaction exists, join it. If not, execute non-transactionally.
- **NOT_SUPPORTED:** Always execute non-transactionally. If a transaction exists, it's suspended.
- **MANDATORY:** Must execute within a transaction. Throws an exception if no transaction exists.
- **NEVER:** Must not execute within a transaction. Throws an exception if a transaction exists.
- **NESTED:** If a transaction exists, execute within a nested transaction. Otherwise, behave like `REQUIRED`. (Requires a JDBC 3.0 compliant driver).

**Example (Incorrect Propagation):**

```plaintext
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void methodA(String data) {
        try {
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
            methodB(data);  // Call to methodB
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error in methodA: " + e.getMessage());
            throw e; // Exception thrown, but methodA has its own transaction
        }
    }

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void methodB(String data) {
         myRepository.save(new MyEntity("B-"+data));
        if (data.equals("error")) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error in methodB");
        }
         myRepository.save(new MyEntity("B-success"));
    }
}
```

In this case, `methodA` and `methodB` both use `REQUIRES_NEW`, meaning they operate in separate transactions. If `methodB` throws an exception, only its transaction will be rolled back. The save in `methodA` will be committed, even though `methodB` failed.

**Solution:**

Use `Propagation.REQUIRED` (the default) if you want `methodB` to participate in the same transaction as `methodA`.

```plaintext
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
    public void methodA(String data) {
        try {
            myRepository.save(new MyEntity(data));
            methodB(data);  // Call to methodB
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error in methodA: " + e.getMessage());
            throw e; // Exception thrown, now methodA's transaction will rollback too
        }
    }

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)
    public void methodB(String data) {
         myRepository.save(new MyEntity("B-"+data));
        if (data.equals("error")) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error in methodB");
        }
         myRepository.save(new MyEntity("B-success"));
    }
}
```

Choose the appropriate propagation level based on your specific requirements. Carefully consider how transactions should behave when methods call each other.

### 5. Configuration Issues

- **Missing `@EnableTransactionManagement`:** Ensure that `@EnableTransactionManagement` is present in your Spring Boot application. While Spring Boot often auto-configures this, it's good practice to explicitly include it, especially if you have custom transaction manager configurations. It's typically placed on your main application class.

  ```plaintext
  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableTransactionManagement
  public class MyApplication {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Incorrect Transaction Manager:** Verify that the correct transaction manager is being used. If you have multiple data sources, you might need to explicitly specify the transaction manager for each one. This is often done using `@Transactional("transactionManagerName")`.

  ```plaintext
  @Service
  public class MyService {

      @Autowired
      private MyRepository myRepository;

      @Transactional("myTransactionManager") // Specify the transaction manager
      public void processData(String data) {
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```

  You would then need to configure `myTransactionManager` as a bean, linking it to the correct `DataSource`.

- **Order of Interceptors:** Ensure that the transaction interceptor is executed before any other interceptors that might catch exceptions. Use the `@Order` annotation or implement `Ordered` interface if necessary.

### 6. Database Issues

- **Database Doesn't Support Transactions:** Ensure your database engine supports transactions (e.g., InnoDB for MySQL, not MyISAM).
- **Autocommit Enabled:** Make sure autocommit is disabled. Spring manages the transaction boundaries, so you shouldn't have autocommit interfering. While Spring usually handles this, it's worth checking your database connection settings.

### 7. Asynchronous Methods and Threads

- **@Async Methods:** If your `@Transactional` method is also annotated with `@Async`, the transaction will likely not be properly managed. `@Async` methods are executed in separate threads, and Spring's transaction management is typically tied to the thread's context. Transactions started in one thread will not automatically propagate to another thread. You will need to carefully manage transactions across threads, often using techniques like `TransactionTemplate`.

### 8. Proxy Issues

- **CGLIB vs. JDK Dynamic Proxies:** Spring uses either JDK dynamic proxies (based on interfaces) or CGLIB proxies (subclassing) for AOP. CGLIB is used by default if the class doesn't implement an interface. Sometimes CGLIB can have issues, particularly with final methods. Try explicitly specifying proxyTargetClass = true in @EnableTransactionManagement to force CGLIB usage, or consider refactoring to use interfaces.

  ```plaintext
  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableTransactionManagement(proxyTargetClass = true)
  public class MyApplication {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
      }
  }
  ```

## Debugging Tips

- **Enable Debug Logging:** Enable debug logging for Spring's transaction management to see exactly what's happening. Add the following to your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

  ```properties
  logging.level.org.springframework.transaction=DEBUG
  logging.level.org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager=DEBUG
  ```

- **Check the Exception Stacktrace:** Carefully examine the exception stacktrace to understand where the exception is being thrown and how it's being handled.
- **Use a Debugger:** Set breakpoints in your `@Transactional` method and step through the code to see if the transaction is being started, committed, or rolled back.
- **Inspect the Database:** After running your code, check the database to see if the data has been modified as expected. This can help you confirm whether the transaction was actually committed or rolled back.

## Conclusion

Debugging `@Transactional` issues can be frustrating, but by understanding the common pitfalls and using the debugging tips provided, you can effectively troubleshoot and ensure that your Spring Boot applications maintain data consistency. Remember to carefully consider exception handling, propagation levels, self-invocation issues, and configuration settings to avoid unexpected behavior. Always aim for clear, concise, and well-tested code to leverage the power of Spring's transaction management effectively.
