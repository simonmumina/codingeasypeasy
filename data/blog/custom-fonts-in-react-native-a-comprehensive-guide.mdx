# Custom Fonts in React Native: A Comprehensive Guide

React Native provides a fantastic platform for building cross-platform mobile applications. While the default system fonts are functional, using custom fonts can significantly enhance the visual appeal and brand identity of your app. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating custom fonts into your React Native projects for both iOS and Android.

## Why Use Custom Fonts?

- **Brand Identity:** Reinforce your brand by using fonts that align with your company's style guide.
- **Improved User Experience:** Choose fonts that are more readable and aesthetically pleasing, leading to a better user experience.
- **Unique Design:** Differentiate your app from the competition with unique and eye-catching typography.
- **Accessibility:** Select fonts that are designed for accessibility, ensuring users with visual impairments can easily read your content.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing Custom Fonts in React Native

### 1. Obtain Your Font Files

The first step is to acquire the font files you want to use. Common font formats include:

- **TTF (TrueType Font):** Widely supported and generally a good choice for React Native.
- **OTF (OpenType Font):** Similar to TTF, offering additional features like advanced typography.

Make sure you have the correct licenses for the fonts you plan to use, especially if they are commercial fonts. Many free font resources are available online, such as Google Fonts and Font Squirrel.

### 2. Create a `fonts` Directory

Create a directory named `fonts` in the root of your React Native project. This directory will hold all your font files.

```
your-project/
├── android/
├── ios/
├── fonts/      <-- Create this directory
│   ├── MyCustomFont-Regular.ttf
│   ├── MyCustomFont-Bold.ttf
│   └── ...
├── App.js
└── ...
```

Place your font files (e.g., `MyCustomFont-Regular.ttf`, `MyCustomFont-Bold.ttf`) inside the `fonts` directory. **Make sure the file names are correctly descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.**

### 3. Configure `react-native.config.js` (or `metro.config.js`)

This step is crucial for linking your font files to your native projects. If you're using React Native version 0.60 or higher, you likely have a `react-native.config.js` file. If not, you might need to create one. Older projects may use `metro.config.js`.

**a. `react-native.config.js`**

Create `react-native.config.js` in your project's root directory if it doesn't exist:

```plaintext
// react-native.config.js
module.exports = {
  project: {
    ios: {},
    android: {}, // grouped into "project"
  },
  assets: ['./assets/fonts'], // stays the same
}
```

**b. `metro.config.js` (for older projects)**

Open `metro.config.js` (or create one if it doesn't exist) in your project's root directory and add the following configuration:

```plaintext
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('metro-config')

module.exports = (async () => {
  const {
    resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts },
  } = await getDefaultConfig()
  return {
    transformer: {
      babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('react-native-svg-transformer'),
    },
    resolver: {
      assetExts: assetExts.filter((ext) => ext !== 'svg'),
      sourceExts: [...sourceExts, 'svg'],
    },
    projectRoot: __dirname,
    watchFolders: [],
    resolver: {
      assetExts: [...assetExts, 'ttf', 'otf'], // Add ttf and otf
    },
  }
})()
```

**Important Notes:**

- **`assetExts`:** Ensure that `ttf` and `otf` are included in the `assetExts` array. This tells Metro to recognize these files as assets.
- **React Native SVG Transformer:** The `transformer` configuration is optional and specifically related to supporting SVG files, which you might not need in the context of just adding fonts. If you don't have `react-native-svg-transformer` installed, you can remove this block.
- **`projectRoot`**: Usually, it is automatically detected; however, you can explicitly define it for non-standard setups.
- **`watchFolders`**: This array is useful for optimizing watchman's file scanning, especially in monorepos.

### 4. Link the Fonts to Your Project

Run the following command in your terminal from the root of your React Native project:

```plaintext
npx react-native link
```

This command links the fonts to your native projects (iOS and Android). If you encounter issues, try running with `--verbose` for more detailed output:

```plaintext
npx react-native link --verbose
```

If the linking fails, you might need to manually link the fonts (see manual linking instructions below).

### 5. Verify Fonts in Native Projects

After linking, verify that the fonts are correctly added to your native projects.

**a. iOS (Xcode):**

1.  Open your project in Xcode (located in the `ios` directory).
2.  Navigate to your project's target, then select the "Build Phases" tab.
3.  Under "Copy Bundle Resources," you should see your font files listed.

**b. Android (Android Studio):**

1.  Open your project in Android Studio (located in the `android` directory).
2.  Navigate to `android/app/src/main/assets/fonts`.
3.  You should see your font files in this directory.

If the fonts are missing in either project, manual linking is required (see below).

### 6. Use the Fonts in Your React Native Code

Now that the fonts are linked, you can use them in your React Native components using the `fontFamily` style property. **The `fontFamily` name MUST match the PostScript name of your font, NOT necessarily the filename!**

**a. Finding the Font Family Name (PostScript Name)**

- **macOS:** Open the font file in Font Book. The "PostScript name" is listed in the font information.
- **Windows:** Right-click the font file and select "Properties." Go to the "Details" tab and look for "Full name" or "PostScript name."
- **Online Tools:** You can use online font identifier tools to extract the PostScript name from your font file. Just search for "Font Identifier" in your search engine.

**b. Using the Font in a Component**

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native'

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',
  },
  customFontRegular: {
    fontFamily: 'MyCustomFont-Regular', // Replace with your font's PostScript name
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  customFontBold: {
    fontFamily: 'MyCustomFont-Bold', // Replace with your font's PostScript name
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold', // Optional, if your font doesn't have a built-in bold variant
  },
})

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.customFontRegular}>Custom Font Regular</Text>
      <Text style={styles.customFontBold}>Custom Font Bold</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default App
```

**Explanation:**

- Import the necessary components from `react-native`.
- Create a `StyleSheet` to define your styles.
- Use the `fontFamily` property to specify the PostScript name of your custom font.
- Apply the style to your `Text` component.

### 7. Rebuild Your App

After adding the font files and configuring your project, you need to rebuild your app for the changes to take effect:

```plaintext
npx react-native run-android  // For Android
npx react-native run-ios    // For iOS
```

If you're still having issues, try cleaning the build cache:

```plaintext
cd ios && pod install && cd .. // For iOS: Install pods
npm start -- --reset-cache       // For both iOS and Android: Clear Metro bundler cache
```

### Manual Linking of Fonts (If `react-native link` fails)

If the `react-native link` command fails, you'll need to manually link the fonts.

**a. iOS (Xcode):**

1.  Open your project in Xcode (located in the `ios` directory).
2.  Right-click on your project's name in the Project Navigator and select "Add Files to [Your Project Name]..."
3.  Navigate to your `fonts` directory and select all the font files you want to add. **Ensure "Create folder references" is selected** (important!).
4.  Go to your project's target, then select the "Build Phases" tab.
5.  Under "Copy Bundle Resources," click the "+" button and add your font files.
6.  Update `Info.plist`: Open `Info.plist` as Source Code. Add the following key and array to it:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
    <string>MyCustomFont-Regular.ttf</string>
    <string>MyCustomFont-Bold.ttf</string>
    <!-- Add all your font files here -->
</array>
```

**b. Android (Android Studio):**

1.  Open your project in Android Studio (located in the `android` directory).
2.  If the `android/app/src/main/assets/fonts` directory doesn't exist, create it.
3.  Copy your font files into the `android/app/src/main/assets/fonts` directory.
4.  No further configuration is typically needed for Android beyond placing the fonts in the `assets/fonts` directory. Metro handles the rest.

### Troubleshooting

- **Font Not Displaying:** Double-check the `fontFamily` name in your code. It **must** match the font's PostScript name exactly.
- **Fonts Missing in Native Projects:** Verify that the font files are correctly listed in the "Copy Bundle Resources" (iOS) and `assets/fonts` directory (Android).
- **Build Errors:** Ensure that the `ttf` and `otf` extensions are included in the `assetExts` array in your `metro.config.js` file.
- **Cache Issues:** Try clearing the Metro bundler cache using `npm start -- --reset-cache`. Clean your project in Xcode and rebuild. Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio.
- **iOS Simulator/Emulator Issues:** Sometimes, the iOS simulator or Android emulator can have cached font data. Try restarting the simulator/emulator.

### Conclusion

Adding custom fonts to your React Native application is a crucial step towards creating a polished and branded user experience. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly integrate custom fonts into your iOS and Android apps. Remember to double-check the font family names, rebuild your project, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. With a little patience and attention to detail, you can achieve a visually stunning and unique mobile application.
