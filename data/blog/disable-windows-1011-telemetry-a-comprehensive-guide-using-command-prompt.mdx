# Disable Windows 10/11 Telemetry: A Comprehensive Guide Using Command Prompt

Windows telemetry, while designed to improve the operating system by collecting data about how you use it, can raise privacy concerns. Many users prefer to minimize or completely disable telemetry to safeguard their personal information. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to disabling Windows 10 and Windows 11 telemetry using the Command Prompt (CMD). We'll cover various methods, from using built-in settings to employing Group Policy and Registry edits, all accessible through the command line.

## Understanding Windows Telemetry

Before diving into the how-to, it's crucial to understand what Windows telemetry is. Telemetry collects information about your system's hardware, software, performance, and how you use Windows features. This data is sent to Microsoft to help them identify problems, improve compatibility, and develop new features. While Microsoft argues this improves the user experience, some users are uncomfortable with the level of data collection.

## Why Disable Windows Telemetry?

- **Privacy:** Minimizing data collection enhances your privacy and control over your personal information.
- **Resource Usage:** Telemetry can consume system resources, potentially impacting performance, especially on older hardware.
- **Bandwidth:** The data being uploaded to Microsoft can consume bandwidth, particularly on metered connections.
- **Security:** While unlikely, any data collection introduces a potential security risk, however small.

## Methods for Disabling Telemetry via Command Prompt

This guide explores various methods for reducing or disabling Windows telemetry using Command Prompt (CMD). Remember to run CMD as an administrator for these commands to take effect.

**Important:** Before making any changes, it's highly recommended to create a system restore point. This allows you to revert your system to its previous state if anything goes wrong.

### 1. Modifying Diagnostic Data Settings (Basic Telemetry Reduction)

This is the simplest and most recommended method for most users. It doesn't completely disable telemetry but reduces it to the basic level.

**Command:**

```plaintext
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" /v AllowTelemetry /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

**Explanation:**

- `reg add`: This command adds a new registry value or modifies an existing one.
- `"HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection"`: This is the registry path where the telemetry settings are located.
- `/v AllowTelemetry`: This specifies the value name to modify, which controls the telemetry level.
- `/t REG_DWORD`: This defines the data type as a 32-bit integer.
- `/d 0`: This sets the value to 0, which corresponds to the "Security" (or "Basic" on older versions) telemetry level.
- `/f`: This forces the command to execute without prompting for confirmation.

**Verification:**

You can verify the setting by checking the Diagnostic Data settings in the Settings app (Privacy -> Diagnostics & feedback). The Diagnostic data option should be set to "Required diagnostic data".

### 2. Disabling Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service (Advanced Method)

This method goes a step further by disabling the "Connected User Experiences and Telemetry" service. This service is responsible for collecting and sending telemetry data.

**Commands:**

```plaintext
sc config "DiagTrack" start= disabled
sc stop "DiagTrack"
```

**Explanation:**

- `sc config "DiagTrack" start= disabled`: This configures the "DiagTrack" service (Connected User Experiences and Telemetry) to be disabled. The `start= disabled` parameter prevents the service from starting automatically.
- `sc stop "DiagTrack"`: This stops the "DiagTrack" service if it's currently running.

**Important:** Disabling this service _might_ affect some Windows features that rely on it. Test thoroughly after applying this change.

### 3. Disabling Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP)

The Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) collects data about how you use Windows and certain applications. You can disable this to further reduce data collection.

**Commands:**

```plaintext
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\SQMClient" /v CEIPEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SQMClient" /v CEIPEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

**Explanation:**

- These commands add or modify the `CEIPEnable` registry value in both the current user (HKCU) and local machine (HKLM) hives.
- Setting the value to `0` disables CEIP.

### 4. Disabling Cortana (Voice Activation and Data Collection)

While not directly telemetry, Cortana can collect and send data about your voice input and usage patterns. Disabling it can improve privacy.

**Commands (This effectively removes Cortana from Win10/11):**

```plaintext
taskkill /f /im Cortana.exe
takeown /f C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy /r /d y
icacls C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy /grant administrators:F /t
ren C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy Cortana_Disabled
```

**Explanation:**

- `taskkill /f /im Cortana.exe`: Forces the Cortana process to close.
- `takeown /f C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy /r /d y`: Takes ownership of the Cortana folder, recursively. This is necessary to modify its permissions.
- `icacls C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy /grant administrators:F /t`: Grants full control to the Administrators group for the Cortana folder and all its subfolders and files.
- `ren C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy Cortana_Disabled`: Renames the Cortana folder, effectively disabling it.

**Warning:** This will remove Cortana. If you need to re-enable Cortana, you'll need to revert the rename and permissions. This can be complex. Consider disabling Cortana within its settings first if you prefer a less drastic approach.

### 5. Using Group Policy (Pro and Enterprise Editions Only)

If you have Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education, you can use the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) to manage telemetry settings. While you can't directly manipulate Group Policy from CMD, you can use CMD to _import_ Group Policy settings.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a .reg file:** Create a text file (e.g., `disable_telemetry.reg`) with the following content:

    ```reg
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection]
    "AllowTelemetry"=dword:00000000
    ```

2.  **Import the .reg file:** Open Command Prompt as administrator and run:

    ```plaintext
    reg import disable_telemetry.reg
    ```

**Explanation:**

- The `.reg` file contains the registry settings to disable telemetry, similar to the first method.
- `reg import` imports the settings from the `.reg` file into the registry, effectively setting the Group Policy.

**Important:** Group Policy settings override other settings. This is a more persistent way to disable telemetry. Note that after making the changes in Group Policy you may need to run `gpupdate /force` in CMD to apply the changes immediately.

### 6. Disabling Handwriting Data Sharing

This is important for tablet users or anyone who uses handwriting recognition.

**Command:**

```plaintext
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\InputPersonalization" /v RestrictImplicitInkCollection /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

**Explanation:**

- This command adds or modifies the `RestrictImplicitInkCollection` registry value. Setting it to `1` disables handwriting data sharing.

## Important Considerations and Cautions

- **Administrator Privileges:** All the commands mentioned above require administrator privileges. Make sure to run Command Prompt as an administrator.
- **System Restore Point:** Always create a system restore point before making significant changes to your system.
- **Potential Issues:** Disabling telemetry _might_ affect some Windows features or applications. Test thoroughly after making changes.
- **Windows Updates:** Windows updates may sometimes revert your changes. You may need to reapply these settings after major updates.
- **Microsoft's Policy:** Microsoft's telemetry policy is subject to change. Always stay informed about the latest updates and privacy settings.
- **Legality:** Be aware of your local laws and regulations regarding data collection and privacy.
- **Reverting Changes:** To revert changes made by registry edits, you can delete the relevant registry keys or set the values back to their defaults. For services, use `sc config "DiagTrack" start= auto` to set the service to start automatically and then restart the service with `sc start "DiagTrack"`.
- **Reboot:** Rebooting your system after applying these changes is recommended to ensure they are fully implemented.

## Conclusion

Disabling or reducing Windows telemetry via the Command Prompt is a powerful way to enhance your privacy. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can take control of the data your Windows system collects and sends to Microsoft. Remember to proceed with caution, create a system restore point, and test thoroughly after making any changes. Continuously monitor your privacy settings and stay informed about the latest updates and telemetry policies from Microsoft.
