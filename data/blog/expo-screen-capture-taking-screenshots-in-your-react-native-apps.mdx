# Expo Screen Capture: Taking Screenshots in Your React Native Apps

Capturing screenshots programmatically within a React Native application can unlock a range of interesting possibilities, from simplifying bug reporting to enhancing user sharing features. The `expo-screen-capture` library provides a straightforward and reliable solution for adding this functionality to your Expo-based React Native projects. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the installation, implementation, and advanced usage of `expo-screen-capture`.

## What is `expo-screen-capture`?

`expo-screen-capture` is an Expo module that allows your React Native application to capture screenshots of the device's screen. It provides a simple API for triggering a screenshot and handling the result. It's particularly useful for:

- **Bug Reporting:** Users can easily capture screenshots of errors to provide clear visual feedback to developers.
- **Sharing Content:** Allow users to quickly share app content with others through screenshots.
- **Tutorials and Guides:** Programmatically capture screenshots to create in-app tutorials or onboarding sequences.
- **Content Creation:** Enabling users to generate and share visual content directly from your application.
- **Automated Testing:** Capture screenshots as part of your automated testing process to verify UI elements and visual consistency.

## Getting Started: Installation

Before you can start capturing screenshots, you need to install the `expo-screen-capture` library in your Expo project. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run the following command:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-screen-capture
```

This command installs the `expo-screen-capture` package and updates your project's dependencies.

**Important:** After installing the package, you will need to rebuild your application if you are using a development build or ejecting to bare workflow. For managed workflow, simply restarting the Expo Go app (or your development build) will often suffice.

## Basic Usage: Taking a Screenshot

The core functionality of `expo-screen-capture` revolves around the `captureScreen` function. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```javascript
import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture'
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { Button, Image, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [screenshotUri, setScreenshotUri] = useState(null)

  const handleCaptureScreenshot = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await ScreenCapture.captureScreen({
        format: 'png', // Optional: 'png' (default), 'jpg', 'jpeg'
        quality: 0.9, // Optional: Quality of the image (0-1, default 0.9)
      })

      if (result && result.uri) {
        setScreenshotUri(result.uri)
        console.log('Screenshot captured!', result.uri)
      } else {
        console.warn('Screenshot capture failed.')
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error capturing screenshot:', error)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Capture Screenshot" onPress={handleCaptureScreenshot} />
      {screenshotUri && <Image source={{ uri: screenshotUri }} style={styles.screenshotImage} />}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  screenshotImage: {
    width: 200,
    height: 300,
    marginTop: 20,
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import:** We import the `ScreenCapture` module from `expo-screen-capture`.
2.  **`handleCaptureScreenshot` Function:**
    - This asynchronous function is called when the "Capture Screenshot" button is pressed.
    - It calls `ScreenCapture.captureScreen()` to take the screenshot.
    - We use `try...catch` to handle potential errors during the screenshot capture process.
    - The `captureScreen` function returns an object with a `uri` property, which is the local file path of the captured screenshot.
    - We update the `screenshotUri` state with the `uri` of the captured screenshot.
3.  **Rendering:**
    - A `Button` triggers the `handleCaptureScreenshot` function.
    - An `Image` component displays the captured screenshot if the `screenshotUri` state is not null.

## Configuration Options

The `captureScreen` function accepts an optional configuration object that allows you to customize the screenshot capture process:

- **`format` (optional):** Specifies the image format of the screenshot. Acceptable values are `'png'` (default), `'jpg'`, and `'jpeg'`.
- **`quality` (optional):** Controls the image quality of the screenshot (applies only to `'jpg'` and `'jpeg'` formats). The value should be between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the highest quality. The default value is 0.9.

**Example with different format and quality:**

```javascript
const handleCaptureScreenshot = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await ScreenCapture.captureScreen({
      format: 'jpg',
      quality: 0.7,
    })

    if (result && result.uri) {
      setScreenshotUri(result.uri)
      console.log('Screenshot captured!', result.uri)
    } else {
      console.warn('Screenshot capture failed.')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error capturing screenshot:', error)
  }
}
```

## Handling Errors

Screenshot capture can fail for various reasons, such as:

- **Permissions:** The application may not have the necessary permissions to access storage or the screen.
- **System Errors:** Underlying system errors can prevent the screenshot from being captured.

It's crucial to handle errors gracefully to provide a good user experience. The example code above demonstrates how to use `try...catch` blocks to catch potential errors during the `captureScreen` call and log the error message. You can further enhance error handling by displaying a user-friendly error message to the user.

## Permissions

On some platforms (particularly Android), you might need to explicitly request storage permissions before you can successfully capture screenshots. The `expo-permissions` library (deprecated but often necessary for older Expo SDKs) or the `expo-image-picker` library (which implicitly requests storage access when picking images) can be used to manage permissions.

**Using `expo-image-picker` (as a workaround to request storage permission):**

While `expo-image-picker` is primarily for selecting images, it _implicitly_ requests storage permissions that `expo-screen-capture` often requires, _especially_ on Android. This is a common and accepted workaround. You don't actually have to pick an image, just requesting permissions is often enough.

```javascript
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker'
import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, Image, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [screenshotUri, setScreenshotUri] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      const { status } = await ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync()
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        alert('Sorry, we need media library permissions to capture screenshots!')
      }
    })()
  }, [])

  const handleCaptureScreenshot = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await ScreenCapture.captureScreen({
        format: 'png',
        quality: 0.9,
      })

      if (result && result.uri) {
        setScreenshotUri(result.uri)
        console.log('Screenshot captured!', result.uri)
      } else {
        console.warn('Screenshot capture failed.')
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error capturing screenshot:', error)
      alert('Error capturing screenshot: ' + error.message) // User-friendly message
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Capture Screenshot" onPress={handleCaptureScreenshot} />
      {screenshotUri && <Image source={{ uri: screenshotUri }} style={styles.screenshotImage} />}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  screenshotImage: {
    width: 200,
    height: 300,
    marginTop: 20,
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import:** We import `* as ImagePicker` and `useEffect`.
2.  **`useEffect` Hook:**
    - This hook runs once when the component mounts.
    - It uses `ImagePicker.requestMediaLibraryPermissionsAsync()` to request access to the device's media library. This implicitly grants storage permissions.
    - If permissions are not granted, it displays an alert message to the user. This is crucial for UX.
3.  **Error Message**: We have a `alert('Error capturing screenshot: ' + error.message);` inside the `catch` block. This gives the user feedback on _why_ the screenshot may not be captured.

**Important:** In a real-world application, you should provide more informative messages to the user about _why_ you need the permission and how it will be used. Consider adding a settings screen where users can manually grant the permission if they initially decline it. Also, you will want to handle edge cases where the user has permanently denied the permission.

## Advanced Usage: Saving Screenshots

The `captureScreen` function returns a local file URI for the screenshot. You can then use this URI to:

- **Display the Screenshot:** As demonstrated in the basic example, you can display the screenshot in an `Image` component.
- **Save the Screenshot to the Device's Gallery:** Use `expo-media-library` to save the screenshot to the user's photo library.
- **Share the Screenshot:** Use `expo-sharing` to share the screenshot with other applications or services.
- **Upload the Screenshot to a Server:** Use `fetch` or another HTTP client to upload the screenshot to a remote server for bug reporting or other purposes.

**Saving to the Device's Gallery:**

```javascript
import * as ScreenCapture from 'expo-screen-capture'
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library' // Import expo-media-library
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, Image, StyleSheet, View, Alert } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [screenshotUri, setScreenshotUri] = useState(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      const { status } = await MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync()
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        Alert.alert('Permission needed', 'Please grant permission to save the screenshot')
      }
    })()
  }, [])

  const handleCaptureScreenshot = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await ScreenCapture.captureScreen({
        format: 'png',
        quality: 0.9,
      })

      if (result && result.uri) {
        setScreenshotUri(result.uri)
        console.log('Screenshot captured!', result.uri)
      } else {
        console.warn('Screenshot capture failed.')
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error capturing screenshot:', error)
      Alert.alert('Error', `Could not capture screenshot: ${error.message}`)
    }
  }

  const handleSaveScreenshot = async () => {
    if (screenshotUri) {
      try {
        const asset = await MediaLibrary.createAssetAsync(screenshotUri)
        const album = await MediaLibrary.getAlbumAsync('Screenshots') //Choose album name
        if (album === null) {
          await MediaLibrary.createAlbumAsync('Screenshots', asset, false) // create a new album if doesn't exist.
        } else {
          await MediaLibrary.addAssetsToAlbumAsync([asset], album.id, false)
        }

        Alert.alert('Screenshot saved!', 'Screenshot saved to your Screenshots album.')
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error saving screenshot:', error)
        Alert.alert('Error', `Could not save screenshot: ${error.message}`)
      }
    } else {
      Alert.alert('No Screenshot', 'Capture a screenshot first.')
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Capture Screenshot" onPress={handleCaptureScreenshot} />
      {screenshotUri && (
        <>
          <Image source={{ uri: screenshotUri }} style={styles.screenshotImage} />
          <Button title="Save Screenshot" onPress={handleSaveScreenshot} />
        </>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  screenshotImage: {
    width: 200,
    height: 300,
    marginTop: 20,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Install `expo-media-library`:** `npx expo install expo-media-library`
2.  **Import `MediaLibrary`:** `import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';`
3.  **Request Permissions:** Use `MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync()` within a `useEffect` hook to request permissions to access the device's media library. Handle the case where the user denies permissions.
4.  **`handleSaveScreenshot` Function:**
    - This asynchronous function is called when the "Save Screenshot" button is pressed.
    - It checks if a screenshot has been captured (i.e., `screenshotUri` is not null).
    - It uses `MediaLibrary.createAssetAsync(screenshotUri)` to create a media library asset from the screenshot URI.
    - Then it checks to see if a Screenshots album exists.
    - If it doesn't exist, it is created, and the asset is added to the new album
    - Finally, it displays an alert message to the user indicating that the screenshot has been saved.
    - Error handling is included to catch and display any errors that occur during the save process.
5.  **Add Save Button**: Add the save button, which appears when a screen shot has been taken

## Troubleshooting

- **Permissions Issues:** Double-check that your application has the necessary permissions to access storage or the screen. Use `expo-image-picker` to prompt for storage permission.
- **Screenshot Not Saving:** Ensure that the `uri` returned by `captureScreen` is a valid file path. Verify that the target directory exists and that your application has write access to it.
- **Black Screenshot:** Some emulators or devices may have issues with screen capture. Try testing on a different device or emulator. Avoid capturing secure content (like payment screens), as they may be blocked by the system.
- **Crashing on Android:** If your app is crashing specifically on android, ensure that you have the correct permissions, especially `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`. Sometimes reinstalling the app after granting permissions helps.

## Conclusion

The `expo-screen-capture` library offers a convenient and efficient way to add screen capture functionality to your React Native applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily integrate screenshots into your app's bug reporting, sharing, and content creation workflows. Remember to handle permissions correctly and provide informative error messages to ensure a smooth user experience. Experiment with the configuration options to fine-tune the screenshot capture process and tailor it to your specific needs. Happy coding!
