# Expo Application Services (EAS) Update: Streamlining Mobile App Deployment and Updates

Expo Application Services (EAS) has revolutionized React Native development, and one of its most powerful components is **EAS Update**. This service enables you to seamlessly deploy over-the-air (OTA) updates to your users, bypassing the app store review process for certain types of changes. This post provides a comprehensive guide to EAS Update, covering everything from setup and usage to advanced features and best practices.

## What is EAS Update and Why Use It?

EAS Update is a service provided by Expo that allows you to push code changes directly to your users' devices without requiring them to download a new app version from the app stores (Google Play and App Store). Think of it as a way to deliver "hotfixes" and feature enhancements quickly and efficiently.

Here's why you should consider using EAS Update:

- **Faster Iteration:** Quickly deploy bug fixes and small feature tweaks without waiting for app store review.
- **Improved User Experience:** Users get the latest version of your app instantly, without needing to manually update.
- **A/B Testing:** Deploy different versions of your app to different user segments for A/B testing new features and UI elements.
- **Targeted Updates:** Control which users receive specific updates based on factors like app version, platform, or custom metadata.
- **Reduced Deployment Complexity:** EAS Update simplifies the deployment process, making it easier to manage releases and rollbacks.
- **Rollbacks:** Quickly revert to a previous version of your app if a new update introduces issues.

**Important Note:** EAS Update is _not_ intended for major feature releases or changes that require native module updates. Those require a full app store submission. App stores can reject updates that misuse OTA updates.

## Setting up EAS Update

Before you can start using EAS Update, you need to configure your Expo project and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites:

- An existing Expo project. If you don't have one, create a new project using: `npx create-expo-app my-app`
- An Expo account. Sign up at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).
- The Expo CLI installed globally: `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`
- EAS CLI installed globally: `npm install -g eas-cli` or `yarn global add eas-cli`

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1.  **Initialize EAS:**

    Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

    ```plaintext
    eas init
    ```

    This command will guide you through initializing your project with EAS. Choose "JavaScript" for the source code language if prompted. If you already have EAS configured, this will skip.

2.  **Configure `eas.json`:**

    The `eas.json` file in your project's root directory configures EAS for your project. Add the following update section to your `eas.json` configuration (adjust the `distribution` value based on your needs, `store` by default.):

    ```json
    {
      "build": {
        "development": {
          "distribution": "internal",
          "android": {
            "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleDebug"
          },
          "ios": {
            "buildConfiguration": "Debug"
          }
        },
        "preview": {
          "distribution": "internal"
        },
        "production": {}
      },
      "submit": {
        "production": {}
      },
      "update": {
        "production": {
          "channel": "production"
        },
        "preview": {
          "channel": "preview"
        },
        "staging": {
          "channel": "staging"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    - **`update`**: Contains configuration options for EAS Update.
    - **`production`**, **`preview`**, **`staging`**: These represent different environments or channels for your updates.
    - **`channel`**: The name of the channel to which updates will be published. Think of channels as separate release tracks for your app (e.g., "production" for stable releases, "preview" for beta users).
    - **`distribution`**: Controls how the builds can be distributed. `internal` is for testers inside your expo org. `store` will generate builds for the app stores.

    **Important:** You can have different channel names for different environments (e.g., "production" for the live app, "staging" for a testing environment).

3.  **Install `expo-updates`:**

    Install the `expo-updates` package in your project:

    ```plaintext
    npx expo install expo-updates
    ```

    This package provides the necessary native modules to handle OTA updates.

4.  **Configure `app.json` or `app.config.js`:**

    Add the `updates` key to your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file:

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "my-app",
        "slug": "my-app",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "updates": {
          "url": "https://u.expo.dev/<your-project-id>"
        },
        "runtimeVersion": {
          "policy": "sdkVersion"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    - **`updates.url`**: This is where your app will check for updates. Replace `<your-project-id>` with your actual project ID, which can be found on your Expo project dashboard (expo.dev).
      - **Important**: After the first published update, this will be updated with a unique ID and version.
    - **`runtimeVersion.policy`**: Specifies how the runtime version is determined. `sdkVersion` ties it to the Expo SDK version, ensuring compatibility between your updates and the Expo runtime. Other options include `nativeVersion` and `appVersion`, each with its own advantages and considerations. Choosing the right policy is crucial for managing update compatibility.

5.  **Modify the App Entry Point (`App.js` or `index.js`):**

    Import and use the `useUpdate` hook from `expo-updates`. This hook provides information about available updates and allows you to trigger updates manually. It handles the logic for downloading and applying the updates.

    ```javascript
    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
    import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, Platform, Alert } from 'react-native'
    import * as Updates from 'expo-updates'

    export default function App() {
      const [updateAvailable, setUpdateAvailable] = useState(false)
      const [updateMetadata, setUpdateMetadata] = useState(null)
      const [isChecking, setIsChecking] = useState(false)

      const onFetchUpdateAsync = async () => {
        setIsChecking(true)
        try {
          const updateCheckResult = await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()

          if (updateCheckResult.isAvailable) {
            setUpdateAvailable(true)
            setUpdateMetadata(updateCheckResult)
          } else {
            Alert.alert('No updates found')
          }
        } catch (e) {
          // handle or log error
          console.error(e)
        } finally {
          setIsChecking(false)
        }
      }

      const onReloadAsync = async () => {
        setIsChecking(true)
        try {
          await Updates.reloadAsync()
        } catch (e) {
          // handle or log error
          console.error(e)
        } finally {
          setIsChecking(false)
        }
      }

      useEffect(() => {
        async function updateApp() {
          if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
            Updates.addListenerForUpdateAvailable((event) => {
              Alert.alert('New Update Available', 'Would you like to update the app?', [
                {
                  text: 'Cancel',
                  style: 'cancel',
                },
                { text: 'Update', onPress: () => Updates.reloadAsync() },
              ])
            })
          }
        }

        updateApp()

        // Check for updates on app start
        onFetchUpdateAsync()

        // Optional: Periodically check for updates in the background
        const intervalId = setInterval(
          () => {
            onFetchUpdateAsync()
          },
          60 * 60 * 1000
        ) // Check every hour

        return () => clearInterval(intervalId) // Cleanup interval on unmount
      }, [])

      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text>Hello world!</Text>
          <Button title="Check for Updates" onPress={onFetchUpdateAsync} disabled={isChecking} />
          {updateAvailable && (
            <Button title="Apply Update" onPress={onReloadAsync} disabled={isChecking} />
          )}
        </View>
      )
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: '#fff',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    })
    ```

    This example demonstrates a basic approach:

    - **`useEffect` hook:** Checks for updates when the component mounts and sets up a recurring check every hour. It also shows an alert when updates are available (Android only), prompting the user to update.
    - **`checkForUpdateAsync()`:** Checks if an update is available.
    - **`reloadAsync()`:** Applies the update and reloads the app.

6.  **Build the app:**

    To properly test updates you need to build the app using EAS Build. First configure your native files with the `expo prebuild` command.

    ```plaintext
    npx expo prebuild
    ```

    Then build the app by selecting your distribution strategy, `store` for Google Play and App Store.

    ```plaintext
    eas build -p android --profile production
    eas build -p ios --profile production
    ```

    or alternatively you can specify the platform. If you do not have a profile configured the CLI will prompt to to set one up. Make sure you have a distribution strategy for each build profile.

## Publishing Updates with EAS Update

Now that you've set up EAS Update, you can start publishing updates to your users.

1.  **Make Changes to Your Code:**

    Modify your JavaScript code (e.g., change the text displayed in your app).

2.  **Publish the Update:**

    Run the following command to publish an update to the `production` channel:

    ```plaintext
    eas update -m "Fix: Corrected a typo in the welcome message."
    ```

    - **`-m`**: Specifies a message describing the update. This message will be visible in the Expo dashboard and can be helpful for tracking changes.

    You can also publish to a different channel:

    ```plaintext
    eas update --channel preview -m "Beta: Testing new UI improvements"
    ```

3.  **Check the Expo Dashboard:**

    Go to your Expo project dashboard ([expo.dev](https://expo.dev/)) and navigate to the "Updates" section. You should see the update you just published listed, along with its message and target channel.

4.  **Test the Update:**

    - **Install the Build:** Make sure you have the build you generated previously using `eas build`.
    - **Restart the App:** Close and reopen your app on a physical device or emulator (a cold start is recommended).
    - **Verify the Changes:** You should see the changes you made in your code reflected in the app after it restarts. If the updates don't apply immediately, try toggling background app refresh in your device settings (iOS) or clearing the app's cache (Android).

## Advanced Features and Best Practices

EAS Update offers several advanced features that can help you manage your updates more effectively.

### 1. Channels:

- **Purpose:** Isolate updates for different user groups or environments.
- **Example:** Use a "staging" channel for internal testing and a "production" channel for public releases.
- **Usage:** Specify the channel when publishing updates using the `--channel` flag with the `eas update` command.

### 2. Rollbacks:

- **Purpose:** Revert to a previous update if a new update introduces issues.
- **Method:** Use the Expo dashboard or the EAS CLI to unpublish an update from a channel. Users will then revert to the previous published update (or the version included in their installed app if no previous update exists).
- **Example:** If a new update causes a critical bug, immediately unpublish it to restore the app to a stable state.

### 3. Targeted Updates (Using Metadata):

- **Purpose:** Deliver updates only to specific users based on criteria like app version, platform, user ID, or custom metadata.
- **Implementation:**
  - Set metadata in your app's code (e.g., `Updates.setExtraPropertyAsync('userId', '12345')`).
  - Use the `--metadata` flag with `eas update` to specify metadata conditions for the update.
- **Example:** Publish an update only to users on iOS version 15 or lower: `eas update --metadata '{"platform": "ios", "osVersion": {"$lte": "15"}}'`

### 4. Runtime Versions and Update Compatibility:

- **Runtime Version Policy**: As discussed earlier, correctly configuring the `runtimeVersion.policy` in `app.json` is critical for update compatibility. If you release a native update requiring a new native dependency, you may need to build a new version.

### 5. Automating with CI/CD

- **Github Actions**: The eas-cli supports creating releases based on your github actions. Here is an example of a Github Action you can use to create releases with EAS Update

```yaml
name: EAS Update Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install
      - name: Install EAS CLI
        run: npm install -g eas-cli
      - name: Publish EAS Update
        run: eas update --auto --message "🚀 New Update Available"
        env:
          EAS_BUILD_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.EAS_BUILD_USERNAME }}
          EAS_BUILD_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.EAS_BUILD_PASSWORD }}
```

### 6. Best Practices for Using EAS Update:

- **Use Channels Effectively:** Plan your channel strategy carefully. Consider using separate channels for development, staging, and production.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your updates in a staging environment before deploying them to production.
- **Communicate with Users:** Inform users about updates, especially if they involve significant changes.
- **Monitor Updates:** Keep an eye on your app's performance and error logs after deploying updates.
- **Use Descriptive Update Messages:** Provide clear and concise messages when publishing updates so you can easily track changes.
- **Avoid Large Updates:** Break down large changes into smaller, incremental updates to minimize the risk of introducing issues.
- **Be Mindful of App Store Policies:** EAS Update is not a substitute for full app store submissions. Don't use it for changes that violate app store guidelines.

## Troubleshooting EAS Update

If you encounter issues with EAS Update, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

- **Check the Expo Logs:** Use `expo logs` to view your app's logs and identify any errors related to updates.
- **Verify Configuration:** Double-check your `app.json`, `eas.json` and `.env` files for any configuration errors.
- **Clear Cache:** Try clearing your app's cache and data on your device or emulator.
- **Restart the App:** Make sure you're completely closing and reopening the app to trigger the update check.
- **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure that your device has a stable internet connection.
- **Consult the Expo Documentation:** The Expo documentation ([https://docs.expo.dev/](https://docs.expo.dev/)) provides detailed information about EAS Update and troubleshooting tips.
