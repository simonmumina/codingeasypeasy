# Unsung Heroes of Django: Underrated Packages Every Developer Should Know

Django, the high-level Python web framework, is a powerhouse for building robust and scalable web applications. While established packages like Django REST Framework (DRF) and Django Allauth are widely recognized, numerous other gems often fly under the radar. This post shines a spotlight on some of the most underrated Django packages that can significantly enhance your development workflow and improve your application's functionality.

## Why Consider Underrated Packages?

Before diving into the list, let's understand why exploring less-known packages is beneficial:

- **Increased Productivity:** Many underrated packages offer specialized solutions, automating tasks and saving you valuable development time.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Some packages provide cleaner and more maintainable alternatives to common Django patterns.
- **Solving Specific Problems:** You might find a package perfectly tailored to address a unique challenge in your project.
- **Learning Opportunities:** Exploring diverse packages broadens your knowledge of the Django ecosystem and introduces you to new coding techniques.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Avoid reinventing the wheel! Many packages provide pre-built functionality that eliminates repetitive coding.

## The List: Underrated Django Packages

Here's a curated list of underrated Django packages, categorized by functionality, along with code examples to illustrate their usage:

### 1. Django Crispy Forms: Beautiful and DRY Forms

**What it is:** Django Crispy Forms provides a way to render Django forms in a visually appealing and consistent manner using various CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and more. It emphasizes a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach, reducing boilerplate code in your templates.

**Why it's Underrated:** Many developers manually style forms, leading to inconsistent and often less-than-ideal results. Crispy Forms offers a streamlined solution for attractive and responsive form rendering.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install django-crispy-forms
```

**Settings:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'crispy_forms',
]

CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4' # or 'bootstrap5', 'foundation', etc.
```

**Usage:**

```plaintext
# forms.py
from django import forms

class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(label="Your Name")
    email = forms.EmailField(label="Your Email")
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea, label="Your Message")
```

```plaintext
{# templates/contact.html #} {% load crispy_forms_tags %}

<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %} {{ form|crispy }}
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Explanation:**

- We load the `crispy_forms_tags` in our template.
- We pipe the form object to the `|crispy` filter, which automatically renders the form using the specified template pack (Bootstrap 4 in this case). This handles labels, input fields, and error messages.

### 2. Django-Filter: Dynamic Filtering Made Easy

**What it is:** Django-Filter provides generic filtering views for Django, allowing users to easily filter querysets based on various criteria. It integrates seamlessly with Django's ORM and supports filtering by field lookups (e.g., `exact`, `contains`, `range`).

**Why it's Underrated:** Building filtering functionality from scratch can be complex, especially for models with many fields. Django-Filter simplifies this process significantly.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install django-filter
```

**Settings:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_filters',
]
```

**Usage:**

```plaintext
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

```plaintext
# filters.py
import django_filters
from .models import Product

class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
    name = django_filters.CharFilter(lookup_expr='icontains') # Case-insensitive contains
    price__gt = django_filters.NumberFilter(field_name='price', lookup_expr='gt') # Price greater than

    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = ['name', 'category', 'price'] # Fields to be available for filtering
```

```plaintext
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Product
from .filters import ProductFilter

def product_list(request):
    products = Product.objects.all()
    product_filter = ProductFilter(request.GET, queryset=products)
    return render(request, 'product_list.html', {'filter': product_filter})
```

```plaintext
{# templates/product_list.html #}
<form method="get">
  {{ filter.form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>

<ul>
  {% for product in filter.qs %}
  <li>{{ product.name }} - ${{ product.price }} - {{ product.category }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

**Explanation:**

- We define a `ProductFilter` that inherits from `django_filters.FilterSet`.
- We specify the model and fields we want to filter on. We can also customize the filter type (e.g., `CharFilter`, `NumberFilter`) and lookup expressions (`icontains`, `gt`).
- In the view, we instantiate the filter with the request's GET parameters and the queryset.
- In the template, we render the filter's form and iterate through the filtered queryset (`filter.qs`).

### 3. Celery: Asynchronous Task Queue/Job Queue

**What it is:** Celery is a powerful asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It allows you to offload time-consuming tasks from your Django application's main thread, improving performance and responsiveness. Common use cases include sending emails, processing images, generating reports, and more.

**Why it's Underrated:** Many developers underestimate the impact of synchronous tasks on their application's performance. Celery provides a robust and scalable solution for handling asynchronous operations.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install celery redis # Redis is a common broker for Celery
```

**Settings:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0' # Redis connection URL
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['application/json']
CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'UTC' # Or your desired timezone
```

**Usage:**

```plaintext
# tasks.py (create this file)
from celery import shared_task
from django.core.mail import send_mail

@shared_task
def send_email_task(subject, message, recipient_list):
    send_mail(subject, message, 'from@example.com', recipient_list)
    return None # Celery tasks should return None or simple data types

# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .tasks import send_email_task

def my_view(request):
    send_email_task.delay("Subject", "Message", ["recipient@example.com"])
    return HttpResponse("Email sending in the background!")
```

**Explanation:**

- We define a Celery task using the `@shared_task` decorator. This decorator makes the function available as a Celery task.
- We use `send_email_task.delay()` to schedule the task to be executed asynchronously. This returns immediately without blocking the main thread.
- Celery will pick up the task and execute it in a separate worker process.

**Important Considerations for Celery:**

- **Broker:** Celery requires a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) to pass tasks between your Django application and the Celery workers.
- **Workers:** You need to run Celery workers to execute the tasks. You can start a worker with `celery -A your_project worker -l info`.
- **Result Backend:** Optionally, you can configure a result backend (e.g., Redis, database) to store the results of your Celery tasks.
- **Concurrency:** Consider the number of Celery workers and concurrency settings to optimize task execution.

### 4. Django-Debug-Toolbar: Invaluable Debugging Tool

**What it is:** Django Debug Toolbar is a panel that appears in your browser when you're developing your Django application. It provides valuable debugging information, including database queries, template rendering context, settings, headers, and more.

**Why it's Underrated:** Many developers rely solely on print statements and Django's built-in debugging tools. The Debug Toolbar offers a much more comprehensive and user-friendly debugging experience.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install django-debug-toolbar
```

**Settings:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'debug_toolbar',
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
]

INTERNAL_IPS = [
    '127.0.0.1',
]
```

**Usage:**

Simply run your Django development server. The Debug Toolbar will automatically appear in the top right corner of your browser when you visit a page.

**Explanation:**

- We add `debug_toolbar` to `INSTALLED_APPS` and `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE`.
- `INTERNAL_IPS` specifies the IP addresses from which the Debug Toolbar will be displayed. This is typically set to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) for local development.

The Debug Toolbar provides a wealth of information, allowing you to quickly identify performance bottlenecks, understand database queries, and debug template issues.

### 5. Django-RQ: Integrate Redis Queue with Django

**What it is:** Django-RQ is a simple Django app that allows you to queue jobs using Redis. It’s a great alternative to Celery for smaller projects or when you need a simpler task queue. It provides an admin interface to monitor the queues and jobs.

**Why it's Underrated:** While Celery is more powerful, Django-RQ offers a lightweight and easier-to-setup alternative for simpler background task scenarios.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install django-rq
```

**Settings:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_rq',
]

RQ = {
    'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 360, # Job timeout in seconds
}
```

**Usage:**

```plaintext
# tasks.py
import django_rq

@django_rq.job
def my_task(arg1, arg2):
    # Do some work here
    print(f"Executing task with args: {arg1}, {arg2}")
    return f"Result: {arg1 + arg2}"


# views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .tasks import my_task

def my_view(request):
    queue = django_rq.get_queue()
    queue.enqueue(my_task, 10, 20)
    return HttpResponse("Task enqueued!")
```

**Explanation:**

- Use `@django_rq.job` decorator to define tasks.
- Use `django_rq.get_queue()` to get the queue instance.
- Use `queue.enqueue` to enqueue the tasks.

Remember to start the RQ worker: `python manage.py rqworker default`. You can also monitor the queues from the Django admin panel.

### 6. Django-Extensions: A Collection of Useful Tools

**What it is:** Django-Extensions is a collection of custom extensions for the Django Framework. It includes various management commands and tools that can significantly improve your development workflow.

**Why it's Underrated:** It provides commands for common tasks like generating models from existing databases, running shell plus with pre-loaded models, and visualizing model relationships.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install django-extensions
```

**Settings:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
]
```

**Useful Commands:**

- `python manage.py shell_plus`: Opens a shell with pre-loaded Django models.
- `python manage.py graph_models`: Generates a visual representation of your models.
- `python manage.py reset_db`: Resets the database.
- `python manage.py show_urls`: Shows a list of all the URLs in your project.
- `python manage.py create_template_tags`: Creates a template tags file.

**Example: Generating a Model Diagram**

```plaintext
python manage.py graph_models -a -o my_models.png
```

This command generates a PNG file named `my_models.png` containing a visual representation of all your Django models and their relationships.

### 7. Django-Guard: Object-Level Permissions

**What it is:** Django-Guard provides a simple way to manage object-level permissions in your Django projects.

**Why it's Underrated:** While Django offers user-level permissions, object-level permissions are often necessary for finer-grained access control. Django-Guard simplifies the implementation of such permissions.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install django-guardian
```

**Settings:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'guardian',
]

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend', # default
    'guardian.backends.ObjectPermissionBackend',
)

ANONYMOUS_USER_ID = -1
```

**Usage:**

```plaintext
# models.py
from django.db import models
from guardian.mixins import GuardianUserMixin

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class MyUser(GuardianUserMixin, models.Model): # Important: GuardianUserMixin must be before Django's abstract user models for migrations to work correctly
  username = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

```plaintext
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required
from .models import MyModel

@permission_required('myapp.change_mymodel', (MyModel, 'id', 'mymodel_id')) #Requires that a user has the 'change_mymodel' permission on the specific object with the id provided by mymodel_id
def my_view(request, mymodel_id):
    mymodel = MyModel.objects.get(pk=mymodel_id)
    # ...
    return render(request, 'myapp/my_template.html', {'mymodel': mymodel})
```

**Explanation:**

- We need to add guardian to `INSTALLED_APPS` and the object permissions backend to `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`
- Then, use the `permission_required` decorator, or programmatically check `user.has_perm('change_mymodel', obj=some_model_instance)`
