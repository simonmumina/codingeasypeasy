# Graph Theory Explained: Nodes, Edges, Eulerian Paths, and Applications

Graph theory is a fascinating branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between objects. Instead of dealing with numerical values, it focuses on connections. These connections are represented by **graphs**, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Think of social networks, road maps, or even the relationships between different components in a computer system. All of these can be elegantly represented and analyzed using graph theory.

This post will delve into the fundamental concepts of graph theory, including nodes (vertices), edges, different types of graphs, and the intriguing world of Eulerian paths. We'll also explore practical applications of graph theory and provide code examples to illustrate key concepts.

## What is a Graph?

A graph, in the context of graph theory, consists of two primary components:

- **Nodes (Vertices):** These represent the objects or entities in the relationship. They are usually depicted as circles or dots.

- **Edges:** These represent the connections or relationships between the nodes. They are typically drawn as lines connecting the nodes.

Formally, a graph _G_ is defined as an ordered pair _G = (V, E)_, where:

- _V_ is a set of vertices (nodes).
- _E_ is a set of edges, where each edge is a pair of vertices in _V_.

## Types of Graphs

Graphs can be categorized based on their properties and the types of relationships they represent:

- **Undirected Graph:** In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction. An edge between nodes A and B signifies a bidirectional relationship. For example, a friendship network where if A is friends with B, B is also friends with A.

- **Directed Graph (Digraph):** In a directed graph, the edges have a specific direction. An edge from node A to node B means that there is a relationship from A to B, but not necessarily from B to A. Think of a Twitter following network where A follows B, but B may not follow A.

- **Weighted Graph:** A weighted graph assigns a numerical value (weight) to each edge. This weight can represent distance, cost, capacity, or any other relevant metric. Road maps with distances between cities are a classic example.

- **Unweighted Graph:** In an unweighted graph, all edges are considered to have equal weight (usually implicitly assumed to be 1).

- **Simple Graph:** A simple graph is an undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a node to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

- **Multigraph:** A multigraph allows multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

- **Pseudograph:** A pseudograph allows both loops and multiple edges.

- **Complete Graph:** A complete graph is a simple graph where every pair of distinct nodes is connected by an edge.

- **Connected Graph:** A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of nodes.

- **Disconnected Graph:** A graph is disconnected if there are nodes that are not reachable from other nodes. It consists of multiple connected components.

- **Cyclic Graph:** A graph containing at least one cycle. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

- **Acyclic Graph:** A graph containing no cycles. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is commonly used in dependency management and scheduling.

## Representing Graphs

Graphs can be represented in various ways in computer programs. Two common representations are:

1.  **Adjacency Matrix:** An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the entry `matrix[i][j]` is 1 if there is an edge between node _i_ and node _j_, and 0 otherwise. For weighted graphs, the entry `matrix[i][j]` would contain the weight of the edge, and potentially infinity or a special value if there's no edge.

    ```plaintext
    # Adjacency Matrix Representation (Undirected Graph)
    num_nodes = 5
    adjacency_matrix = [[0] * num_nodes for _ in range(num_nodes)]

    # Add edges (example)
    adjacency_matrix[0][1] = 1
    adjacency_matrix[1][0] = 1 # Because it's undirected

    adjacency_matrix[1][2] = 1
    adjacency_matrix[2][1] = 1

    # Print the matrix
    for row in adjacency_matrix:
        print(row)
    ```

2.  **Adjacency List:** An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of lists. Each element in the array corresponds to a node, and the list at that index contains the nodes that are adjacent to that node.

    ```plaintext
    # Adjacency List Representation (Directed Graph)
    num_nodes = 5
    adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(num_nodes)]

    # Add edges (example)
    adjacency_list[0].append(1)  # Edge from node 0 to node 1
    adjacency_list[1].append(2)  # Edge from node 1 to node 2
    adjacency_list[2].append(0)  # Edge from node 2 to node 0

    # Print the adjacency list
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        print(f"Node {i}: {adjacency_list[i]}")
    ```

    Adjacency lists are generally more space-efficient for sparse graphs (graphs with relatively few edges), while adjacency matrices are more efficient for dense graphs (graphs with many edges) and offer faster edge lookup.

## Traversing Graphs

Graph traversal involves systematically visiting all the nodes in a graph. Two common graph traversal algorithms are:

1.  **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** BFS explores the graph level by level. It starts at a source node and visits all its neighbors before moving on to the neighbors of those neighbors. BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.

    ```plaintext
    from collections import deque

    def bfs(graph, start_node):
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([start_node])
        visited.add(start_node)

        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            print(node, end=" ")

            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)

    # Example usage
    graph = {
        0: [1, 2],
        1: [0, 3, 4],
        2: [0, 4],
        3: [1],
        4: [1, 2]
    }

    print("BFS Traversal:")
    bfs(graph, 0) # Starting from node 0
    print()
    ```

2.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):** DFS explores the graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a source node and visits one of its neighbors, then visits a neighbor of that neighbor, and so on until it reaches a dead end. DFS uses a stack (often implicitly through recursion) to keep track of the nodes to visit.

    ```plaintext
    def dfs(graph, node, visited):
        visited.add(node)
        print(node, end=" ")

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

    # Example usage (same graph as BFS)
    graph = {
        0: [1, 2],
        1: [0, 3, 4],
        2: [0, 4],
        3: [1],
        4: [1, 2]
    }

    print("DFS Traversal:")
    visited = set()
    dfs(graph, 0, visited) # Starting from node 0
    print()
    ```

## Eulerian Paths and Circuits

An **Eulerian path** (also called an Euler walk) is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. An **Eulerian circuit** (or Euler cycle) is an Eulerian path that starts and ends at the same node.

**Conditions for Eulerian Paths and Circuits:**

- **Eulerian Circuit:** A connected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every node has an even degree (number of edges incident to the node).

- **Eulerian Path:** A connected graph has an Eulerian path (but not an Eulerian circuit) if and only if exactly two nodes have an odd degree. The path must start at one of these odd-degree nodes and end at the other.

**Finding an Eulerian Path/Circuit (Fleury's Algorithm):**

Fleury's algorithm is a classic algorithm for finding Eulerian paths and circuits. Here's a simplified version:

1.  Start at a node with an odd degree (if one exists; otherwise, start at any node).
2.  While there are edges remaining:
    - Choose an edge to traverse from the current node. Prefer edges that are _not_ bridges (edges that, if removed, would disconnect the graph). If all available edges are bridges, choose one arbitrarily.
    - Traverse the edge to the next node.
    - Remove the traversed edge from the graph.

```plaintext
def find_eulerian_path(graph):
    """
    Finds an Eulerian path in the given graph using Fleury's Algorithm.
    Returns the path as a list of nodes.
    """

    def is_bridge(graph, u, v):
        """Checks if the edge (u, v) is a bridge."""
        if len(graph[u]) == 1:
            return False # Edge to a leaf node is never a bridge

        # Use DFS to check connectivity after removing the edge
        visited = set()
        count1 = dfs_count(graph, u, visited)

        # Remove edge (u,v) temporarily
        temp_graph_u = graph[u].copy()
        temp_graph_v = graph[v].copy()

        graph[u].remove(v)
        graph[v].remove(u)

        visited = set()
        count2 = dfs_count(graph, u, visited)


        # Restore graph
        graph[u] = temp_graph_u
        graph[v] = temp_graph_v

        return count1 != count2


    def dfs_count(graph, node, visited):
        """Performs DFS and counts the number of reachable nodes."""
        visited.add(node)
        count = 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                count += dfs_count(graph, neighbor, visited)
        return count


    def find_start_node(graph):
        """Finds a suitable start node for the Eulerian path."""
        odd_degree_nodes = [node for node in graph if len(graph[node]) % 2 != 0]
        if odd_degree_nodes:
            return odd_degree_nodes[0]  # Start at an odd-degree node
        else:
            return next(iter(graph))    # Start at any node if all have even degree

    # Make a copy of the graph to avoid modifying the original
    graph_copy = {node: graph[node].copy() for node in graph}
    start_node = find_start_node(graph_copy)
    path = [start_node]
    current_node = start_node

    while graph_copy[current_node]:
        next_node = None
        for neighbor in graph_copy[current_node]:
            if not is_bridge(graph_copy, current_node, neighbor):
                next_node = neighbor
                break
            else:
                next_node = neighbor #If no edge is found that is not a bridge, take any edge


        #If no edges found exit loop (corner case that could happen from initial bad graph)
        if next_node == None:
            return path

        path.append(next_node)
        graph_copy[current_node].remove(next_node)
        graph_copy[next_node].remove(current_node)
        current_node = next_node

    return path

# Example graph (undirected)
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2, 3],
    2: [0, 1, 3],
    3: [1, 2]
}

eulerian_path = find_eulerian_path(graph)
print(f"Eulerian Path: {eulerian_path}")


graph2 = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2, 3],
    2: [0, 1],
    3: [1,4],
    4:[3]
}
eulerian_path2 = find_eulerian_path(graph2)
print(f"Eulerian Path: {eulerian_path2}")

graph3 = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2, 3,4],
    2: [0, 1],
    3: [1,4],
    4:[1,3,5],
    5:[4]
}
eulerian_path3 = find_eulerian_path(graph3)
print(f"Eulerian Path: {eulerian_path3}")

graph4 = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2, 3,4],
    2: [0, 1],
    3: [1,4],
    4:[1,3]
}
eulerian_path4 = find_eulerian_path(graph4)
print(f"Eulerian Path: {eulerian_path4}")
```

**Note:** Fleury's algorithm has a time complexity of O(E^2) where E is the number of edges, because `is_bridge` may perform a DFS traversal for each edge chosen. More efficient algorithms like Hierholzer's algorithm exist to find Eulerian paths and circuits in O(E) time. Hierholzer's algorithm is iterative and uses a stack. It repeatedly explores unvisited edges from the current node, adding them to the path until it returns to the starting node. Then it moves back up the stack to explore other branches.
