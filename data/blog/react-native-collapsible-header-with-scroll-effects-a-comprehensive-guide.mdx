# React Native Collapsible Header with Scroll Effects: A Comprehensive Guide

Creating visually appealing and engaging user interfaces is crucial for mobile app success. A collapsible header with scroll effects adds a touch of sophistication and provides a better user experience by maximizing screen real estate and dynamically revealing relevant information. This guide will walk you through building a smooth and performant collapsible header in React Native using `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler`.

## Why Collapsible Headers?

Collapsible headers offer several advantages:

- **Improved User Experience:** They gracefully expand and collapse as the user scrolls, revealing content as needed and maximizing the visible area when content is the primary focus.
- **Enhanced Aesthetics:** The animation and dynamic behavior create a modern and engaging visual experience.
- **Space Optimization:** By collapsing when not needed, the header minimizes its footprint, allowing more content to be displayed on the screen.
- **Information Prioritization:** You can strategically display or hide different elements within the header based on the scroll position, highlighting the most relevant information at each stage.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following installed and configured in your React Native project:

- **React Native:** A working React Native project. (If you don't have one, create a new project using `npx react-native init YourProjectName`).
- **React Native Reanimated:** This library is essential for creating performant animations. Install it using:

  ```plaintext
  npm install react-native-reanimated
  # or
  yarn add react-native-reanimated
  ```

  **Important:** Follow the [React Native Reanimated installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/installation/) carefully, including the necessary Babel plugin configuration and any platform-specific setup (especially for iOS). Incorrect installation can lead to animation issues.

- **React Native Gesture Handler:** Needed for handling scroll events and gestures. Install it using:

  ```plaintext
  npm install react-native-gesture-handler
  # or
  yarn add react-native-gesture-handler
  ```

  **Important:** Link `react-native-gesture-handler` to your project as outlined in the [official documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started). This often involves modifying your `android/app/build.gradle` file and `ios/YourProjectName/AppDelegate.m` (or `AppDelegate.mm` for newer projects). Don't skip this step!

- **(Optional) React Native SafeAreaContext:** Recommended for handling notch and status bar areas, especially on iOS.

  ```plaintext
  npm install react-native-safe-area-context
  # or
  yarn add react-native-safe-area-context
  ```

## Setting up the Basic Structure

Let's start by creating the basic structure of our component. We'll have a `ScrollView` to display our content and a header component.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { View, ScrollView, StyleSheet, Text, Dimensions } from 'react-native'

const { height } = Dimensions.get('window')

const Content = () => (
  <View style={styles.content}>
    {Array.from({ length: 50 }).map((_, index) => (
      <Text key={index} style={styles.contentText}>
        Item {index + 1}
      </Text>
    ))}
  </View>
)

const Header = () => (
  <View style={styles.header}>
    <Text style={styles.headerTitle}>Collapsible Header</Text>
    <Text style={styles.headerSubtitle}>Subheading goes here</Text>
  </View>
)

const CollapsibleHeader = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Header />
      <ScrollView style={styles.scrollView}>
        <Content />
      </ScrollView>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  header: {
    backgroundColor: 'skyblue',
    height: 200,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  headerTitle: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  headerSubtitle: {
    fontSize: 16,
  },
  scrollView: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  content: {
    padding: 16,
  },
  contentText: {
    fontSize: 18,
    paddingVertical: 8,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ddd',
  },
})

export default CollapsibleHeader
```

This provides a basic scrolling view with a fixed header. Now, let's add the animation logic.

## Implementing the Collapsible Behavior with React Native Reanimated

Here's where the magic happens. We'll use `react-native-reanimated` to animate the header's height and other properties based on the scroll position.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { View, ScrollView, StyleSheet, Text, Dimensions } from 'react-native'
import Animated, {
  useSharedValue,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  useAnimatedScrollHandler,
  interpolate,
  Extrapolate,
} from 'react-native-reanimated'

const { height: SCREEN_HEIGHT } = Dimensions.get('window')
const HEADER_HEIGHT = 200

const Content = () => (
  <View style={styles.content}>
    {Array.from({ length: 50 }).map((_, index) => (
      <Text key={index} style={styles.contentText}>
        Item {index + 1}
      </Text>
    ))}
  </View>
)

const Header = ({ animatedHeaderHeight, animatedOpacity }) => (
  <Animated.View style={[styles.header, { height: animatedHeaderHeight }]}>
    <Animated.View style={[styles.headerContent, { opacity: animatedOpacity }]}>
      <Text style={styles.headerTitle}>Collapsible Header</Text>
      <Text style={styles.headerSubtitle}>Subheading goes here</Text>
    </Animated.View>
  </Animated.View>
)

const CollapsibleHeader = () => {
  const scrollY = useSharedValue(0)

  const animatedHeaderHeight = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      height: interpolate(
        scrollY.value,
        [0, HEADER_HEIGHT],
        [HEADER_HEIGHT, 50], // Minimal header height
        { extrapolateLeft: Extrapolate.CLAMP, extrapolateRight: Extrapolate.CLAMP }
      ),
    }
  })

  const animatedOpacity = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      opacity: interpolate(scrollY.value, [0, HEADER_HEIGHT / 2], [1, 0], {
        extrapolateLeft: Extrapolate.CLAMP,
        extrapolateRight: Extrapolate.CLAMP,
      }),
    }
  })

  const scrollHandler = useAnimatedScrollHandler({
    onScroll: (event) => {
      scrollY.value = event.contentOffset.y
    },
  })

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Header animatedHeaderHeight={animatedHeaderHeight} animatedOpacity={animatedOpacity} />
      <Animated.ScrollView
        style={styles.scrollView}
        onScroll={scrollHandler}
        scrollEventThrottle={16} // Adjust for performance
      >
        <Content />
        <View style={{ height: SCREEN_HEIGHT }} />{' '}
        {/* Important! Prevents content from being hidden behind header */}
      </Animated.ScrollView>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  header: {
    backgroundColor: 'skyblue',
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    zIndex: 10, // Ensure the header is above the content
    overflow: 'hidden',
  },
  headerContent: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  headerTitle: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  headerSubtitle: {
    fontSize: 16,
  },
  scrollView: {
    flex: 1,
    marginTop: HEADER_HEIGHT, // Important!  Push the scrollview below the header
  },
  content: {
    padding: 16,
  },
  contentText: {
    fontSize: 18,
    paddingVertical: 8,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderBottomColor: '#ddd',
  },
})

export default CollapsibleHeader
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Imports:** We import necessary components from `react-native-reanimated`.
2.  **`useSharedValue`:** We create a `scrollY` shared value to store the scroll position. This is the bridge between the native scroll events and the animated styles. It's initialized to `0`.
3.  **`useAnimatedStyle`:** We use `useAnimatedStyle` to create animated styles for the header's height. This hook takes a callback function that returns an object containing the animated style properties.

    - **`interpolate`:** The `interpolate` function maps the `scrollY` value to a different range of values for the height. In this example:

      - When `scrollY` is 0 (at the top), the header height is `HEADER_HEIGHT` (200).
      - When `scrollY` is `HEADER_HEIGHT` (200), the header height is 50 (the minimum height).
      - **`Extrapolate.CLAMP`:** This option prevents the height from going outside the defined range (50-200). If the scroll goes beyond 200 (overscroll), the header height will remain at 50.

    - **`animatedOpacity`:** We use `useAnimatedStyle` and `interpolate` to create a fade-out effect for the header content. The content will be fully visible when the scroll is at the top, and it will fade out as the user scrolls down, creating a cleaner look as the header collapses.

4.  **`useAnimatedScrollHandler`:** This hook allows us to listen for scroll events and update the `scrollY` shared value.
    - `onScroll`: This function is called on every scroll event. We update `scrollY.value` with the `event.contentOffset.y` (the vertical scroll offset).
    - `scrollEventThrottle`: Setting this to 16 (milliseconds) helps to reduce the number of scroll events and improve performance. Adjust this value as needed.
5.  **`Animated.ScrollView`:** We replace the regular `ScrollView` with `Animated.ScrollView` so that the scroll events can be processed by `react-native-reanimated`.
6.  **Styling (`styles`):**
    - `position: 'absolute'`: The header is absolutely positioned at the top of the screen so it overlaps the content.
    - `zIndex: 10`: Ensures the header is rendered above the content.
    - `marginTop: HEADER_HEIGHT`: This is crucial! It pushes the `ScrollView` down by the initial header height, preventing the content from being hidden behind the header when the component initially renders.
    - `overflow: 'hidden'`: This is important to hide any content that might overflow from the header as it collapses.
7.  **Extra height on the content:** Add extra height to the bottom of scrollview to enable to user to scroll to see the full effect of the collapse animation.

## Key Improvements and Considerations

- **Performance:** `react-native-reanimated` is designed for high-performance animations. By moving the animation logic to the native thread, it avoids the JavaScript bridge bottleneck, resulting in smoother animations.
- **Interpolation:** Experiment with different input and output ranges in the `interpolate` function to customize the animation behavior. You can control the speed, direction, and range of the animation.
- **Extrapolation:** Understanding `Extrapolate.CLAMP`, `Extrapolate.EXTEND`, and `Extrapolate.IDENTITY` is crucial for controlling how the animation behaves when the scroll position goes outside the defined range.
- **Customization:** This is a basic example. You can extend it by animating other header properties like background color, text size, or adding more complex transitions. You can even animate the content within the header for a richer experience.
- **SafeAreaView:** Consider wrapping your component with `SafeAreaView` (from `react-native-safe-area-context`) to ensure that the header and content are properly positioned on devices with notches or status bars.

## Adding Header Content Animation

To further enhance the effect, you can animate the content _within_ the header. Let's add an opacity animation to the header text, making it fade out as the header collapses:

(This is already added to the code above with `animatedOpacity` example)

## Integrating with Navigation

If you're using React Navigation, you'll need to integrate the animated header with your navigation header. This usually involves:

1.  Using `navigation.setOptions` to configure the header.
2.  Accessing the `scrollY` shared value within your screen component.
3.  Passing the animated styles to the navigation header using `headerStyle` and `headerTitleStyle`.

The specifics will depend on the version of React Navigation you are using. Refer to the React Navigation documentation for detailed examples.

## Troubleshooting

- **Animations are Janky or Slow:**
  - Ensure you've correctly installed and configured `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler`, including the Babel plugin.
  - Check your `scrollEventThrottle` value. Lower values (e.g., 16) are usually better, but may impact performance. Experiment with higher values if needed.
  - Avoid complex calculations or operations within the `useAnimatedStyle` callback. Keep the logic as simple as possible.
- **Header Disappears or Doesn't Collapse:**
  - Double-check the `marginTop` style on the `ScrollView`. This is essential for positioning the content correctly.
  - Make sure the `position: 'absolute'` and `zIndex` styles are applied to the header.
  - Verify that the `interpolate` ranges and `Extrapolate` settings are configured correctly.
- **Errors Related to `react-native-reanimated`:**
  - Carefully review the React Native Reanimated installation guide and follow all steps precisely. Pay close attention to the Babel plugin configuration.
  - Ensure that your React Native and React Native Reanimated versions are compatible.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a foundation for creating a stunning and performant collapsible header in React Native. By leveraging `react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-gesture-handler`, you can achieve smooth animations and a delightful user experience. Remember to experiment with different animation parameters and styles to customize the header to fit your app's design and functionality. Good luck!
