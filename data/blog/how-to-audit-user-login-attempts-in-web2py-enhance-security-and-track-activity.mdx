# How to Audit User Login Attempts in Web2py: Enhance Security and Track Activity

Auditing user login attempts is crucial for any web application's security. By tracking both successful and failed login attempts, you can identify suspicious activity, potential brute-force attacks, and unauthorized access attempts. This blog post provides a detailed guide on how to implement a robust login audit system in your Web2py applications.

## Why Audit Login Attempts?

- **Security:** Identify and respond to potential security threats like brute-force attacks.
- **Account Monitoring:** Track user activity and detect suspicious patterns.
- **Compliance:** Meet regulatory requirements for security auditing.
- **Troubleshooting:** Analyze login issues and diagnose user problems.
- **Insights:** Gain valuable insights into user behavior and login patterns.

## Prerequisites

- A working Web2py environment.
- Basic understanding of Web2py framework.
- Database configured (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

## Steps to Implement Login Audit in Web2py

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing a comprehensive login audit system:

### 1. Define the Audit Log Table in your Database

First, you need to define a database table to store the audit logs. In your `db.py` file (or any other database definition file), add the following table definition:

```plaintext
db.define_table('login_audit',
    Field('username', 'string', label='Username'),
    Field('login_time', 'datetime', label='Login Time'),
    Field('ip_address', 'string', label='IP Address'),
    Field('user_agent', 'string', label='User Agent'),
    Field('status', 'string', label='Status', requires=IS_IN_SET(['Success', 'Failure'])),
    Field('details', 'text', label='Details'),
    migrate=False #Set to True if you want to migrate the table with the rest
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `username`: The username used for the login attempt.
- `login_time`: The timestamp of the login attempt.
- `ip_address`: The IP address of the user attempting to log in.
- `user_agent`: The user agent string of the user's browser.
- `status`: Indicates whether the login was successful ("Success") or failed ("Failure").
- `details`: Additional information about the login attempt (e.g., reason for failure).
- `migrate=False`: This is often set to `False` for specific audit tables to avoid accidental deletion or modification with general database migrations. If you _are_ using migrations, and want this table to migrate along with the rest of your database, change this to `True`.

**Important Considerations for Database Design:**

- **Database Choice:** While SQLite is fine for development, consider a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for production environments, especially if you anticipate high login volume.
- **Indexing:** Add an index on `login_time` and `username` for faster querying and reporting. You can add this directly in your database after the table is created, or by modifying the table definition in your Web2py code (though manual database modifications are often preferable for audit logs). For example, in PostgreSQL: `CREATE INDEX login_audit_login_time_idx ON login_audit (login_time); CREATE INDEX login_audit_username_idx ON login_audit (username);`
- **Data Retention Policy:** Determine how long you need to retain audit logs based on compliance requirements and storage capacity. Implement a process to archive or delete old logs regularly.
- **Security:** Ensure that the database storing the audit logs is properly secured with appropriate access controls and encryption.

### 2. Implement the Audit Logging Logic

Now, let's implement the logic to log the login attempts. You'll need to modify your authentication functions to record the login attempts. Web2py's `auth` object provides hooks that can be used for this purpose.

Create a function to record login attempts. This function will be called after each login attempt. Add this function in your model or controller file (e.g., `db.py` or `default.py`):

```plaintext
import datetime

def log_login_attempt(username, status, details='', request=request, db=db):
    """Logs a user login attempt to the database."""
    db.login_audit.insert(
        username=username,
        login_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
        ip_address=request.client,
        user_agent=request.env.http_user_agent,
        status=status,
        details=details
    )
    db.commit()  # Important to commit the changes to the database

```

**Explanation:**

- `log_login_attempt(username, status, details='', request=request, db=db)`: This function takes the username, login status, and details as input. It also receives the request and database objects as default parameters.
- `db.login_audit.insert(...)`: This inserts a new record into the `login_audit` table with the provided information.
- `request.client`: Gets the client's IP address from the request object.
- `request.env.http_user_agent`: Gets the user agent string from the request object.
- `db.commit()`: Crucially commits the changes to the database. Without this, the log entry will not be saved.

### 3. Hook into the Authentication Process

Now, we need to integrate the `log_login_attempt` function into Web2py's authentication process. Web2py's `auth` object provides `on_login` and `on_failed_login` hooks for this purpose.

In your `default.py` controller (or where you handle your authentication), use the following code:

```plaintext
def index():
    if request.args(0) == 'login':
        if auth.login_form().accepted:
            log_login_attempt(auth.user.username, 'Success', request=request, db=db)
            redirect(URL('default', 'user')) # Redirect after successful login
        else:
           return dict(form=auth.login_form()) #Display the form if not accepted

    if request.args(0) == 'register':
        if auth.register_form().accepted:
            # Handle registration logic
            redirect(URL('default', 'index'))
        else:
            return dict(form=auth.register_form())

    return dict(message="Hello World")
```

In a more robust application, you would ideally modify the `auth.login()` call directly by wrapping it in a `try...except` block to handle exceptions and log failed attempts accordingly. You would likely want to add `auth.define_tables()` to your `db.py` file too.

**A More Direct `auth.login` Approach (Recommended for better control):**

This method allows you to capture both successful and failed login attempts more directly within the `auth.login()` call.

```plaintext
def login():
    form = auth.login_form()
    if form.process().accepted:
        log_login_attempt(request.vars.username, 'Success', request=request, db=db)
        session.flash = 'Login Successful!'
        redirect(URL('default', 'user')) # Redirect to the user profile page or desired location
    elif form.errors:
        log_login_attempt(request.vars.username, 'Failure', details=str(form.errors), request=request, db=db)
        response.flash = 'Login Failed: ' + str(form.errors)  #Display the specific errors.
    return dict(form=form)
```

**Explanation of the `auth.login` approach:**

- **`request.vars.username`**: Retrieves the username entered in the login form. This is crucial for logging the username even in failed login attempts.
- **`form.errors`**: If the login fails, this dictionary contains the specific errors that occurred, allowing you to provide more detailed error messages in the audit log.
- **`session.flash` and `response.flash`**: Used to display flash messages to the user, indicating the success or failure of the login attempt. The `session` flash persists across redirects while `response` flash only lasts for the current request.
- **Error Details**: The `details=str(form.errors)` captures the error message returned by the authentication process.

### 4. Displaying the Audit Logs (Optional)

To view the audit logs, you can create a controller function and a corresponding view:

**Controller (`default.py`):**

```plaintext
@auth.requires_login() #Requires the user to be logged in to view audit logs
def audit_logs():
    """Displays the audit logs."""
    grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.login_audit,
                         fields=[db.login_audit.username, db.login_audit.login_time,
                                 db.login_audit.ip_address, db.login_audit.status, db.login_audit.details],
                         orderby=~db.login_audit.login_time, #Order by login time, newest first
                         searchable=True,
                         deletable=False, editable=False, create=False) # Disable editing/creating
    return dict(grid=grid)
```

**View (`default/audit_logs.html`):**

```html
{{extend 'layout.html'}}

<h1>Audit Logs</h1>

{{=grid}}
```

This code will display a searchable and sortable grid of the audit logs. The `@auth.requires_login()` decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access this page. You would also likely want to restrict access to this page to only administrator users by checking roles.

### 5. Enhanced Security Considerations and Best Practices

- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Web2py's `Cache` can be used to store the number of login attempts from a specific IP address within a certain time period.

```plaintext
from gluon import current

def check_login_attempts(ip_address):
    """Checks if the login attempts from an IP address exceed the limit."""
    key = 'login_attempts:' + ip_address
    attempts = current.cache.ram.get(key) or 0
    if attempts > 5:  # Limit to 5 attempts per minute (example)
        return False
    else:
        current.cache.ram.increment(key, 1, time_expire=60) # Expire after 60 seconds (1 minute)
        return True
```

In your login controller:

```plaintext
def login():
    form = auth.login_form()
    if not check_login_attempts(request.client):
        response.flash = "Too many failed login attempts. Please try again later."
        return dict(form=form)

    if form.process().accepted:
        log_login_attempt(request.vars.username, 'Success', request=request, db=db)
        session.flash = 'Login Successful!'
        redirect(URL('default', 'user')) # Redirect to the user profile page or desired location
    elif form.errors:
        log_login_attempt(request.vars.username, 'Failure', details=str(form.errors), request=request, db=db)
        response.flash = 'Login Failed: ' + str(form.errors)  #Display the specific errors.
    return dict(form=form)
```

- **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts. Store the number of failed attempts for each user.

```plaintext
def check_account_lockout(username):
    """Checks if an account is locked out due to too many failed attempts."""
    key = 'failed_attempts:' + username
    attempts = current.cache.ram.get(key) or 0
    if attempts > 3: # Lock out after 3 failed attempts
        # Lock the account in the database (e.g., set a 'locked' flag in the 'auth_user' table)
        db(db.auth_user.username == username).update(locked=True)
        db.commit()
        return True
    return False
```

Modify the `auth.login` approach to incorporate the lockout:

```plaintext
def login():
    form = auth.login_form()

    if check_account_lockout(request.vars.username):
        response.flash = "Account locked due to too many failed attempts."
        return dict(form=form)

    if not check_login_attempts(request.client):
        response.flash = "Too many failed login attempts. Please try again later."
        return dict(form=form)

    if form.process().accepted:
        log_login_attempt(request.vars.username, 'Success', request=request, db=db)
        session.flash = 'Login Successful!'
        current.cache.ram.delete('failed_attempts:' + request.vars.username) # Clear failed attempts on success.
        redirect(URL('default', 'user')) # Redirect to the user profile page or desired location
    elif form.errors:
        log_login_attempt(request.vars.username, 'Failure', details=str(form.errors), request=request, db=db)
        response.flash = 'Login Failed: ' + str(form.errors)  #Display the specific errors.
        # Increment the failed attempts count in cache
        key = 'failed_attempts:' + request.vars.username
        attempts = current.cache.ram.get(key) or 0
        current.cache.ram.increment(key, 1, time_expire=3600) # Expire after 1 hour
    return dict(form=form)
```

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA for enhanced security.
- **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies to make it harder for attackers to guess passwords. Web2py's `IS_STRONG` validator can be used for this.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent injection attacks.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Storage:** Store sensitive data, like passwords, using strong encryption and hashing algorithms. Web2py's `auth` object already handles this securely, but always review and update your security practices.

### 6. Reporting and Analysis

The collected login audit data can be used to generate reports on user activity, identify potential security threats, and track the effectiveness of security measures. You can use Web2py's database abstraction layer to create custom queries and reports. You can visualize this data using charting libraries.

### 7. Compliance Considerations

Depending on your industry and location, there may be specific regulatory requirements for security auditing. Ensure that your login audit system meets these requirements. Common regulations include GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.

## Conclusion

Auditing user login attempts is a critical security practice for Web2py applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can implement a robust login audit system that enhances your application's security posture, provides valuable insights into user activity, and helps you meet compliance requirements. Remember to continuously monitor and improve your security practices to stay ahead of potential threats.
