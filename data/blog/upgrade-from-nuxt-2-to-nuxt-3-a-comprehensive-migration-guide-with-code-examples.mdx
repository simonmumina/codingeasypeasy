# Upgrade from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3: A Comprehensive Migration Guide (with Code Examples)

Nuxt 3, built upon Vue 3, offers significant performance improvements, a more flexible development experience, and modern features that make building universal Vue.js applications easier than ever. If you're still using Nuxt 2, upgrading to Nuxt 3 unlocks a new level of potential. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the migration process, highlighting key changes, potential challenges, and best practices.

## Why Upgrade to Nuxt 3?

Before diving into the how-to, let's briefly discuss the benefits:

- **Vue 3 Composition API:** Leverages the power and flexibility of Vue 3's Composition API for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Vite Bundler:** Nuxt 3 uses Vite by default, offering significantly faster cold starts and hot module replacement (HMR) compared to Webpack in Nuxt 2.
- **TypeScript by Default:** Nuxt 3 embraces TypeScript, improving code quality and developer experience.
- **Serverless-First Architecture:** Designed for serverless environments, enabling easier deployment and scalability.
- **Improved Performance:** Vue 3's performance enhancements translate to faster rendering and a smoother user experience.
- **Module Federation:** Simplify micro-frontend architectures with built-in Module Federation support.
- **Nitro Engine:** A powerful server engine that offers improved performance and flexibility.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js version 16 or higher installed. Run `node -v` to check your current version.
- **npm/yarn/pnpm:** Choose your preferred package manager. We'll use `npm` in the examples.
- **Nuxt 2 Project:** You'll need an existing Nuxt 2 project to upgrade.

## Step 1: Upgrade Nuxt 2 Dependencies

First, update your Nuxt 2 project to the latest version. This helps ensure compatibility and reduces potential conflicts.

```bash
npm install nuxt@latest
```

After updating Nuxt 2, address any deprecation warnings or errors that may arise. Resolve these issues before proceeding to the next step.

## Step 2: Create a New Nuxt 3 Project (Recommended)

While it's possible to directly modify your Nuxt 2 project, **creating a fresh Nuxt 3 project is highly recommended.** This provides a clean slate and avoids potential conflicts during the upgrade process. It allows you to progressively migrate your code, testing frequently and ensuring a stable transition.

Create a new Nuxt 3 project using the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi init my-nuxt3-project
cd my-nuxt3-project
npm install
```

Replace `my-nuxt3-project` with your desired project name.

## Step 3: Copy Project Structure and Assets

Now, begin migrating your code from your Nuxt 2 project to your new Nuxt 3 project. Start with the foundational elements:

- **`assets` directory:** Copy all your static assets (images, fonts, etc.) from your Nuxt 2 `assets` directory to the Nuxt 3 `assets` directory.
- **`static` directory:** Copy all files from the Nuxt 2 `static` directory to the Nuxt 3 `public` directory. **Important: Nuxt 3 uses the `public` directory instead of `static`.**

## Step 4: Migrate Pages and Layouts

This is where you'll start adapting your Vue components. Here's a breakdown of common changes:

- **Composition API:** Nuxt 3 encourages the use of the Composition API over the Options API. While the Options API still works, migrating to the Composition API can improve code organization and readability.

  **Nuxt 2 (Options API):**

  ```plaintext
  <template>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </template>

  <script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        title: 'Hello, Nuxt 2!'
      }
    }
  }
  </script>
  ```

  **Nuxt 3 (Composition API):**

  ```plaintext
  <template>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </template>

  <script setup>
  import { ref } from 'vue'

  const title = ref('Hello, Nuxt 3!')
  </script>
  ```

  Key differences:

  - `setup` script: This attribute on the `<script>` tag enables the Composition API.
  - `ref`: The `ref` function from `vue` is used to create reactive variables.
  - No more `data()` method: Reactive data is defined directly within the `setup` script.

- **`asyncData` and `fetch`:** `asyncData` and `fetch` are replaced by `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` composables.

  **Nuxt 2:**

  ```plaintext
  <script>
  export default {
    async asyncData({ $axios }) {
      const { data } = await $axios.$get('/api/posts')
      return { posts: data }
    }
  }
  </script>
  ```

  **Nuxt 3:**

  ```plaintext
  <script setup>
  const { data: posts, pending, error, refresh } = await useAsyncData('posts', () => $fetch('/api/posts'))

  if (error.value) {
    console.error(error.value)
  }
  </script>
  ```

  Key differences:

  - `useAsyncData` / `useFetch`: These composables are used to fetch data asynchronously.
  - Returns multiple values: They return `data`, `pending`, `error`, and `refresh` (among others) for managing the data fetching process.
  - First argument: A unique key used for caching and deduplication of requests.

- **`this.$axios` (or other injected properties):** Accessing globally injected properties (like `$axios`) directly using `this` is no longer the standard way in the Composition API. Instead, you can access them directly, or use `useNuxtApp()`.

  **Nuxt 2:**

  ```javascript
  this.$axios.$get('/api/something')
  ```

  **Nuxt 3:**

  ```javascript
  // Option 1: Direct access (if $axios is still injected)
  $axios.$get('/api/something')

  // Option 2:  Using useNuxtApp()
  const { $axios } = useNuxtApp()
  $axios.$get('/api/something')
  ```

- **`head` property:** The `head` property is replaced by the `useHead` composable.

  **Nuxt 2:**

  ```plaintext
  <script>
  export default {
    head() {
      return {
        title: 'My Page Title',
        meta: [
          { hid: 'description', name: 'description', content: 'My page description' }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  </script>
  ```

  **Nuxt 3:**

  ```plaintext
  <script setup>
  useHead({
    title: 'My Page Title',
    meta: [
      { name: 'description', content: 'My page description' }
    ]
  })
  </script>
  ```

  Key differences:

  - `useHead`: This composable is used to manage the document head.
  - The `hid` property is no longer required for meta tags.

- **Dynamic Components**: Vue 3 changed how dynamic components are used. You need to import `resolveComponent` in `script setup` and use it in your template if your component name is dynamic.

  **Example:**

  ```plaintext
  <template>
      <component :is="currentComponent" />
  </template>

  <script setup>
      import { ref, resolveComponent } from 'vue';

      const componentType = ref('ComponentA'); // Dynamic component name
      const currentComponent = computed(() => resolveComponent(componentType.value));
  </script>
  ```

## Step 5: Migrate Plugins

Plugins in Nuxt 3 are defined slightly differently.

- **`plugins` directory:** Move your plugins from your Nuxt 2 `plugins` directory to your Nuxt 3 `plugins` directory.
- **Configuration:** Update your `nuxt.config.ts` file to register your plugins.

  **Nuxt 2 (nuxt.config.js):**

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    plugins: ['~/plugins/my-plugin.js'],
  }
  ```

  **Nuxt 3 (nuxt.config.ts):**

  ```typescript
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    plugins: [
      { src: '~/plugins/my-plugin.ts', mode: 'client' }, // or 'server' or undefined (both)
    ],
  })
  ```

  Key differences:

  - TypeScript: Nuxt 3 encourages using TypeScript configuration.
  - `defineNuxtConfig`: This function provides type safety for your Nuxt configuration.
  - Plugin modes: The `mode` option specifies whether the plugin should run on the client, server, or both.

- **Plugin Syntax:** The syntax within your plugin file also changes slightly.

  **Nuxt 2 (plugins/my-plugin.js):**

  ```javascript
  export default function ({ app, $axios }, inject) {
    inject('myHelper', (msg) => console.log('Helper:', msg))
  }
  ```

  **Nuxt 3 (plugins/my-plugin.ts):**

  ```typescript
  import { defineNuxtPlugin } from '#app'

  export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
    nuxtApp.provide('myHelper', (msg: string) => console.log('Helper:', msg))
  })
  ```

  Key differences:

  - `defineNuxtPlugin`: This function provides type safety and context for your plugin.
  - `nuxtApp`: The context object is now passed as an argument to the plugin function, not as individual arguments.
  - `provide`: Use `nuxtApp.provide` to inject properties into the application context.

## Step 6: Migrate Modules

Nuxt modules often require updates to be compatible with Nuxt 3. Check the documentation for each module you're using to see if a Nuxt 3-compatible version is available. Some modules may need to be replaced with alternatives.

- **Configuration:** Update your `nuxt.config.ts` file to register your modules.

  **Nuxt 2 (nuxt.config.js):**

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    modules: ['@nuxtjs/axios'],
  }
  ```

  **Nuxt 3 (nuxt.config.ts):**

  ```typescript
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['@nuxtjs/axios'],
  })
  ```

  The registration process is generally the same, but ensure you're using the Nuxt 3 compatible versions of your modules.

- **Module Usage:** The way you use modules may also change. Refer to the module's documentation for specific instructions.

## Step 7: Update `nuxt.config.ts`

The `nuxt.config.ts` file undergoes significant changes in Nuxt 3.

- **TypeScript:** Nuxt 3 uses TypeScript for configuration files. Rename your `nuxt.config.js` to `nuxt.config.ts`.
- **`defineNuxtConfig`:** Wrap your configuration object with the `defineNuxtConfig` function for type safety.
- **Build Configuration:** The `build` property is replaced with `vite` and `nitro`.

  **Nuxt 2 (nuxt.config.js):**

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    build: {
      postcss: {
        plugins: {
          tailwindcss: {},
          autoprefixer: {},
        },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  **Nuxt 3 (nuxt.config.ts):**

  ```typescript
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    vite: {
      css: {
        postcss: {
          plugins: [require('tailwindcss'), require('autoprefixer')],
        },
      },
    },
    nitro: {
      // Server configuration options
    },
  })
  ```

  Key differences:

  - `vite`: Configures the Vite bundler.
  - `nitro`: Configures the Nitro server engine (for server-side rendering and API routes).

- **Route Rules:** Nuxt 3 introduces route rules for fine-grained control over caching, SSR, and more.

  ```typescript
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    routeRules: {
      '/blog/**': { ssr: true },
      '/api/**': { cors: true },
    },
  })
  ```

  This example shows how to enable server-side rendering for all routes under `/blog/` and enable CORS for all routes under `/api/`.

## Step 8: Address Breaking Changes

Be aware of the following breaking changes in Nuxt 3:

- **Context Injection:** As mentioned earlier, access injected properties directly or using `useNuxtApp()`.
- **`vue-meta`:** `vue-meta` is no longer used. Use the `useHead` composable instead.
- **Directory Structure:** `static` becomes `public`.
- **Component Registration:** Global component registration is discouraged. Use explicit imports instead.

## Step 9: Test and Debug

Thoroughly test your application after migrating each component or module. Use your browser's developer tools and server logs to identify and resolve any errors.

- **Run your Nuxt 3 project:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Inspect the console:** Look for any errors or warnings in the browser console and server console.
- **Test different routes:** Ensure that all your pages are rendering correctly and that data is being fetched properly.

## Step 10: Deployment

Once you've thoroughly tested your application, you can deploy it to your preferred hosting provider. Nuxt 3's serverless-first architecture makes it easy to deploy to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and AWS Lambda.

## Best Practices

- **Migrate Incrementally:** Don't try to upgrade everything at once. Migrate components and modules one at a time, testing after each change.
- **Use TypeScript:** Embrace TypeScript to improve code quality and catch errors early.
- **Read the Documentation:** The Nuxt 3 documentation is your best friend. Refer to it frequently for detailed information and examples.
- **Start Small:** Begin by migrating simpler components and modules to get a feel for the process.
- **Commit Frequently:** Commit your changes regularly to a Git repository. This makes it easier to revert to a previous state if something goes wrong.
- **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** The Nuxt community is very active and supportive. Don't hesitate to ask for help on forums or Discord if you get stuck.
