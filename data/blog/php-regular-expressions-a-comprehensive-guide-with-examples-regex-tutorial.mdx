# PHP Regular Expressions: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples (Regex Tutorial)

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulation within strings. In PHP, regular expressions provide a flexible way to search, validate, and replace text based on defined patterns. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamentals of PHP regular expressions, starting with the basics and progressing to more advanced techniques.

## What are Regular Expressions?

At their core, regular expressions are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. This pattern is then used to match and manipulate strings.  They are like advanced wildcards, allowing you to define complex rules for finding and working with text. Regular expressions are a powerful and essential tool for any PHP developer dealing with string processing.

## PHP's Regular Expression Functions

PHP provides several functions for working with regular expressions, primarily leveraging the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library. The most commonly used functions are:

*   **`preg_match()`**: Performs a regular expression match. Returns `1` if the pattern matches once, `0` if no match, and `false` on error.
*   **`preg_match_all()`**: Performs a global regular expression match.  Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the string.
*   **`preg_replace()`**: Performs a regular expression search and replace.
*   **`preg_split()`**: Splits a string into an array using a regular expression.
*   **`preg_grep()`**: Returns an array consisting of the elements of the input array that match the given pattern.
*   **`preg_quote()`**: Quotes regular expression characters.  Useful for escaping special characters in your pattern.

## Basic Regex Syntax and Metacharacters

Let's start with the fundamental building blocks of regular expressions: metacharacters. These special characters have predefined meanings within the regex engine.

*   **`.` (Dot):** Matches any single character except newline.
*   **`^` (Caret):** Matches the beginning of the string or line (depending on multiline mode).
*   **`$` (Dollar):** Matches the end of the string or line (depending on multiline mode).
*   **`*` (Asterisk):** Matches the preceding character or group zero or more times.
*   **`+` (Plus):** Matches the preceding character or group one or more times.
*   **`?` (Question Mark):** Matches the preceding character or group zero or one time.
*   **`[]` (Square Brackets):** Defines a character class, matching any single character within the brackets.
*   **`[^]` (Caret inside Square Brackets):** Defines a negated character class, matching any single character *not* within the brackets.
*   **`()` (Parentheses):** Groups characters together and captures the matched substring (unless used for non-capturing groups, see below).
*   **`|` (Pipe):**  Represents "or". Matches either the expression before or after the pipe.
*   **`\` (Backslash):** Escapes the next character, treating it literally.  Used to match metacharacters themselves.

### Character Classes

Character classes provide shorthand ways to match common character sets:

*   **`\d`:** Matches any digit (0-9). Equivalent to `[0-9]`.
*   **`\D`:** Matches any non-digit character. Equivalent to `[^0-9]`.
*   **`\s`:** Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).
*   **`\S`:** Matches any non-whitespace character.
*   **`\w`:** Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and underscore). Equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`.
*   **`\W`:** Matches any non-word character. Equivalent to `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers control how many times a preceding character or group can appear:

*   **`{n}`:** Matches exactly `n` occurrences.
*   **`{n,}`:** Matches `n` or more occurrences.
*   **`{n,m}`:** Matches between `n` and `m` occurrences.

## Basic `preg_match()` Examples

Let's start with some simple examples using `preg_match()`.

```php
<?php

$string = "Hello, world!";

// Check if the string contains the word "world"
if (preg_match('/world/', $string)) {
  echo "The string contains 'world'.\n";
} else {
  echo "The string does not contain 'world'.\n";
}

// Check if the string starts with "Hello"
if (preg_match('/^Hello/', $string)) {
  echo "The string starts with 'Hello'.\n";
} else {
  echo "The string does not start with 'Hello'.\n";
}

// Check if the string ends with an exclamation mark
if (preg_match('/!$/', $string)) {
  echo "The string ends with an exclamation mark.\n";
} else {
  echo "The string does not end with an exclamation mark.\n";
}

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use forward slashes `/` as delimiters to enclose our regular expression pattern.  Other delimiters can be used like `#` or `~`.
*   In the first example, we're simply checking if the literal string "world" exists within `$string`.
*   `^Hello` checks if the string *starts* with "Hello".
*   `!$` checks if the string *ends* with an exclamation mark.

## Using Character Classes

```php
<?php

$string = "The year is 2023.";

// Check if the string contains a four-digit year
if (preg_match('/\d{4}/', $string)) {
  echo "The string contains a four-digit year.\n";
} else {
  echo "The string does not contain a four-digit year.\n";
}

$string2 = "My phone number is 123-456-7890";

// Check if a string contains phone number
if (preg_match('/\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/', $string2)) {
    echo "The string contains a phone number.\n";
} else {
    echo "The string does not contains a phone number.\n";
}

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `\d{4}` matches exactly four digits.
*   `\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}` matches the pattern of a phone number.

## Case-Insensitive Matching

You can use the `i` modifier to perform case-insensitive matching:

```php
<?php

$string = "Hello, world!";

// Check if the string contains "WORLD" (case-insensitive)
if (preg_match('/world/i', $string)) {
  echo "The string contains 'world' (case-insensitive).\n";
} else {
  echo "The string does not contain 'world'.\n";
}

?>
```

## Capturing Groups with Parentheses

Parentheses `()` create capturing groups. These groups capture the portion of the string that matched the expression inside the parentheses.  You can access these captured groups using the third argument of `preg_match()` which will be populated with the matched substrings.  The element at index `0` will be the entire match and the subsequent indexes will contain the captures from the left to right order.

```php
<?php

$string = "My email is john.doe@example.com";

// Extract the username and domain from the email address
if (preg_match('/([\w.-]+)@([\w.-]+)/', $string, $matches)) {
  echo "Username: " . $matches[1] . "\n";
  echo "Domain: " . $matches[2] . "\n";
} else {
  echo "Email address not found.\n";
}

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `([\w.-]+)` captures one or more word characters, dots, or hyphens (the username).
*   `@` matches the "@" symbol.
*   `([\w.-]+)` captures one or more word characters, dots, or hyphens (the domain).
*   `$matches[1]` contains the captured username.
*   `$matches[2]` contains the captured domain.

## Using `preg_match_all()` for Multiple Matches

`preg_match_all()` finds *all* occurrences of the pattern, not just the first.

```php
<?php

$string = "Apples cost $1, bananas cost $2, and oranges cost $3.";

// Find all the prices
if (preg_match_all('/\$\d+/', $string, $matches)) {
  echo "Prices found: " . implode(", ", $matches[0]) . "\n";
} else {
  echo "No prices found.\n";
}

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `/\$\d+/` matches a dollar sign followed by one or more digits.
*   `$matches[0]` contains an array of all the matched prices.

## Using `preg_replace()` for Search and Replace

`preg_replace()` replaces occurrences of a pattern with a replacement string.

```php
<?php

$string = "Hello, world!";

// Replace "world" with "PHP"
$newString = preg_replace('/world/', 'PHP', $string);

echo $newString . "\n"; // Output: Hello, PHP!

$string2 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

// Remove all vowels from the string
$noVowels = preg_replace('/[aeiouAEIOU]/', '', $string2);

echo $noVowels . "\n";
?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   The first example replaces the word "world" with "PHP".
*   The second example removes all vowels (both upper and lowercase).

## Using `preg_split()` to Split a String

`preg_split()` splits a string into an array based on a regular expression delimiter.

```php
<?php

$string = "apple,banana,orange,grape";

// Split the string into an array using a comma as the delimiter
$fruits = preg_split('/,/', $string);

print_r($fruits);
// Output:
// Array
// (
//     [0] => apple
//     [1] => banana
//     [2] => orange
//     [3] => grape
// )

$string2 = "apple, banana; orange| grape";

$fruits2 = preg_split('/[;,|]\s*/', $string2);

print_r($fruits2);
// Output:
// Array
// (
//     [0] => apple
//     [1] => banana
//     [2] => orange
//     [3] => grape
// )

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   The first example splits the string by commas.
*   The second example splits the string by commas, semicolons or pipes followed by zero or more whitespaces.

## Regular Expression Modifiers (Flags)

Modifiers (also called flags) are appended to the end of the regular expression pattern (after the closing delimiter) to modify the matching behavior.  We've already seen `i` for case-insensitive matching.  Here are some other common modifiers:

*   **`i`**: Case-insensitive matching.
*   **`m`**: Multiline mode.  `^` and `$` match the beginning and end of each line, respectively.
*   **`s`**: Dotall mode.  The `.` (dot) metacharacter matches *any* character, including newline characters.  Without `s`, `.` does not match newlines.
*   **`x`**: Ignore whitespace in the pattern. Allows you to add spaces and comments for readability.
*   **`A`**: Anchored. The pattern is forced to only match at the beginning of the string.
*   **`D`**: Dollar end only. The `$` metacharacter only matches at the very end of the string.  Without this flag, `$` also matches before a final newline.
*   **`U`**: Ungreedy. Reverses the greediness of quantifiers. By default, quantifiers are greedy (they match as much as possible). `U` makes them reluctant (match as little as possible).
*   **`u`**: UTF-8 mode. Enables correct UTF-8 handling.  Crucial when working with Unicode strings.

## Advanced Techniques

### Non-Capturing Groups: `(?:...)`

Sometimes you need to group characters without capturing the matched substring.  You can use `(?:...)` for this:

```php
<?php

$string = "The quick brown fox";

// Match "quick" or "brown" without capturing them
if (preg_match('/(?:quick|brown)\sfox/', $string, $matches)) {
  echo "Match found!\n";
  // $matches[0] contains the full match.
} else {
  echo "Match not found.\n";
}
?>
```

In this example, `(?:quick|brown)` groups "quick" or "brown", but the matched substring is not captured in a separate element in the `$matches` array.

### Lookarounds: `(?=...)`, `(?!...)`, `(?<=...)`, `(?<!...)`

Lookarounds are zero-width assertions that match a position in the string based on what precedes or follows it, without consuming those characters.

*   **`(?=...)` (Positive Lookahead):** Matches if the expression inside the lookahead *follows* the current position.
*   **`(?!...)` (Negative Lookahead):** Matches if the expression inside the lookahead *does not follow* the current position.
*   **`(?<=...)` (Positive Lookbehind):** Matches if the expression inside the lookbehind *precedes* the current position.
*   **`(?<!...)` (Negative Lookbehind):** Matches if the expression inside the lookbehind *does not precede* the current position.

```php
<?php

$string = "apple banana orange applepie";

// Find "apple" only when followed by "pie"
if (preg_match('/\bapple(?=pie\b)/', $string, $matches)) {
  echo "Apple followed by pie: " . $matches[0] . "\n";
} else {
  echo "Apple followed by pie not found.\n";
}

// Find "apple" only when NOT followed by "pie"
if (preg_match('/\bapple(?!pie\b)/', $string, $matches)) {
    echo "Apple not followed by pie found.\n";
} else {
    echo "Apple not followed by pie not found\n";
}

$string2 = "$9.99 $12.50 €15.00";

// Match prices preceded by a dollar sign
if (preg_match_all('/(?<=\$)\d+\.\d+/', $string2, $matches)) {
    print_r($matches[0]); // Output: Array ( [0] => 9.99 [1] => 12.50 )
} else {
    echo "No prices found.\n";
}

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `\bapple(?=pie\b)` matches "apple" only if it's followed by "pie" and a word boundary.
*   `\bapple(?!pie\b)` matches "apple" only if it's NOT followed by "pie" and a word boundary.
*   `(?<=\$)\d+\.\d+` matches a price that is preceded by a dollar sign.

### Backreferences: `\1`, `\2`, etc.

Backreferences allow you to refer to previously captured groups within the same regular expression.  `\1` refers to the first captured group, `\2` refers to the second, and so on.

```php
<?php

$string = "<h1>This is a heading</h1>";

// Match an HTML tag where the opening and closing tags are the same
if (preg_match('/<(h[1-6])>.*<\/\1>/', $string, $matches)) {
  echo "Valid HTML heading tag: " . $matches[0] . "\n";
} else {
  echo "Invalid HTML heading tag.\n";
}

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `<([h1-6])>` captures the opening tag name (e.g., "h1").
*   `.*` matches any characters between the opening and closing tags.
*   `<\/\1>` matches the closing tag, where `\1` refers back to the tag name captured in the first group.  This ensures the opening and closing tags match.

## Practical Examples

### Email Validation

```php
<?php

function validateEmail($email) {
  return preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/', $email);
}

$email1 = "test@example.com";
$email2 = "invalid-email";

echo "$email1 is valid: " . (validateEmail($email1) ? "Yes" : "No") . "\n";
echo "$email2 is valid: " . (validateEmail($email2) ? "Yes" : "No") . "\n";

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   This regex enforces a common email format: `username@domain.tld`.  It allows for alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percentage signs, plus signs, and hyphens in the username and domain.  It requires at least two characters for the top-level domain (tld).

### URL Validation

```php
<?php

function validateURL($url) {
  return preg_match('/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/', $url);
}

$url1 = "https://www.example.com/page";
$url2 = "ftp://example.com"; // Invalid protocol, will still validate
$url3 = "example.com";

echo "$url1 is valid: " . (validateURL($url1) ? "Yes" : "No") . "\n";
echo "$url2 is valid: " . (validateURL($url2) ? "Yes" : "No") . "\n";
echo "$url3 is valid: " . (validateURL($url3) ? "Yes" : "No") . "\n";

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   This regex checks for a valid URL format, including the optional `http://` or `https://` protocol, the domain name, and an optional path.  This can be further tightened to check allowed protocols and more specifically match paths.

### Password Strength Validation

```php
<?php

function validatePassword($password) {
  // Minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number
  return preg_match('/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)[a-zA-Z\d]{8,}$/', $password);
}

$password1 = "P@ssword123";
$password2 = "password";

echo "$password1 is valid: " . (validatePassword($password1) ? "Yes" : "No") . "\n";
echo "$password2 is valid: " . (validatePassword($password2) ? "Yes" : "No") . "\n";

?>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `(?=.*[a-z])` requires at least one lowercase letter.
*   `(?=.*[A-Z])` requires at least one uppercase letter.
*   `(?=.*\d)` requires at least one digit.
*   `[a-zA-Z\d]{8,}` requires at least 8 characters, consisting of letters and digits.

## Common Mistakes and Best Practices

*   **Over-complicating Regex:** Start with simple patterns and gradually add complexity as needed.  Avoid creating overly complex regexes that are difficult to read and maintain.
*   **Forgetting to Escape Special Characters:**  Remember to escape metacharacters like `.` `*` `+` `?` `$` `^` `[]` `()` `\` and `/` when you want to match them literally.  Use `preg_quote()` to automatically escape a string for use in a regular expression.
*   **Not Using the Correct Modifiers:** Pay attention to the modifiers. The `i` modifier can save a lot of effort on case-insensitive matching. The `m` and `s` modifiers are crucial for multiline strings. `u` modifier ensures correct UTF-8 handling.
*   **Performance Considerations:** Regular expressions can be computationally expensive.  Avoid using them unnecessarily, especially in loops.  Consider using simpler string functions like `strpos()` or `strstr()` if possible.  Optimize complex patterns by anchoring them at the beginning or end of the string when appropriate.  Avoid backtracking in complex regexes (this often manifests as performance issues).

## Conclusion

PHP regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to work with strings. By mastering the fundamentals and practicing with examples, you can leverage regex to solve a wide range of text processing challenges.  Remember to start with simple patterns, gradually increase complexity, and always test your regex thoroughly. This guide has hopefully equipped you with the knowledge and tools to effectively utilize regular expressions in your PHP projects. Good luck!
