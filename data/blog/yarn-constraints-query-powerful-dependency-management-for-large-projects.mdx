# Yarn Constraints Query: Powerful Dependency Management for Large Projects

Managing dependencies in large JavaScript projects, especially monorepos, can quickly become a nightmare. Inconsistent versions, accidental inclusion of unwanted packages, and the general lack of enforced consistency can lead to build failures, unexpected runtime errors, and a fragmented codebase. Enter **Yarn Constraints Query**, a powerful feature within Yarn Berry (v2+) that allows you to define rules and policies for your project's dependencies, ensuring consistency and maintainability. This post dives deep into Yarn Constraints Query, providing practical examples and use cases to help you master this essential dependency management technique.

## What are Yarn Constraints?

Yarn Constraints provide a declarative way to express rules about your project's dependencies. These rules are defined in a `.yarn/constraints.pro` file and are enforced by Yarn during installation. Think of it as a type system for your dependencies, preventing you from accidentally introducing inconsistencies. They're not about _resolving_ dependencies; they're about _validating_ that the resolved dependencies adhere to your defined rules.

## Why Use Yarn Constraints?

- **Enforce consistent dependency versions:** Ensure all packages use the same version of a specific library, preventing version conflicts and unexpected behavior.
- **Ban specific packages:** Prohibit the usage of certain libraries known to be problematic or conflicting.
- **Promote best practices:** Enforce coding style, security standards, and other project-specific rules.
- **Manage peer dependencies:** Ensure peer dependencies are compatible across your project.
- **Improve maintainability:** A consistent dependency tree makes debugging and upgrading easier.
- **Scale your monorepo effectively:** Essential for maintaining order and consistency in large, multi-package projects.

## Getting Started with Yarn Constraints

First, ensure you are using Yarn Berry (v2 or higher). If not, upgrade using:

```plaintext
yarn set version berry
```

Next, create a `.yarn/constraints.pro` file in your project root. This file will contain your constraints rules.

## The `constraints.pro` Syntax

The `constraints.pro` file uses a Prolog-like syntax. Don't be intimidated! The basic structure is relatively straightforward:

```prolog
# comments start with #
# Enforce all packages to use react@17.0.2
"react" == "17.0.2" if true;

# Ban the usage of lodash
forbidden "lodash" if true;

# Version of packages with name starting with "@my-company/" should be "^1.0.0"
nameStartsWith("@my-company/") if versionSatisfies(">=1.0.0 <2.0.0");
```

Let's break down the key components:

- **Dependency Selector:** This defines which dependencies the rule applies to. Examples include: `"react"`, `nameStartsWith("@my-company/")`, `nameEndsWith("-component")`, `workspace(foo)`.
- **Operator:** This defines the relationship between the dependency selector and the constraint. Common operators include: `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `versionSatisfies()` (satisfies a semver range), `forbidden` (banned).
- **Value:** This is the value the dependency must adhere to. Examples include: `"17.0.2"`, `">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"`.
- **`if true` (Condition):** The condition determines whether the constraint applies. `true` means the constraint always applies. More complex conditions can be used to apply constraints selectively.

## Common Use Cases and Examples

Let's explore some common scenarios and how to implement them using Yarn Constraints:

### 1. Enforcing a Specific Dependency Version

This is perhaps the most common use case. Let's say you want to ensure that all packages in your project use React version `17.0.2`. Add the following to your `.yarn/constraints.pro` file:

```prolog
"react" == "17.0.2" if true;
"react-dom" == "17.0.2" if true;
```

This rule states that any dependency named "react" or "react-dom" must be exactly version `17.0.2`. If a package attempts to use a different version, Yarn will throw an error during installation.

### 2. Banning a Package

Sometimes, you want to completely prohibit the usage of a specific package. This might be due to security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or simply wanting to standardize on a different library. For example, to ban the use of `lodash`:

```prolog
forbidden "lodash" if true;
```

Any attempt to add `lodash` as a dependency will now result in an error.

### 3. Using Semver Ranges

Instead of requiring an exact version, you can use semver ranges to allow for compatible updates. For example, to ensure all packages use a version of `axios` within the `^0.21.0` range:

```prolog
"axios" versionSatisfies "^0.21.0" if true;
```

This allows versions like `0.21.1`, `0.21.2`, etc., but prevents updates to `0.22.0` or `1.0.0`.

### 4. Targeting Specific Packages with `workspace`

The `workspace` selector allows you to apply constraints to packages within your monorepo. Let's say you want to enforce a specific version of `@types/react` in your `ui-components` package:

```prolog
"@types/react" == "17.0.0" if workspace(ui-components);
```

This constraint only applies to the `@types/react` dependency within the `ui-components` workspace.

### 5. Using Conditions for Complex Scenarios

You can use more complex conditions to apply constraints based on various factors. For instance, you might want to ban a package only in production builds:

```prolog
forbidden "debug" if env("NODE_ENV") == "production"; # Requires yarn install --production
```

This requires that you run `yarn install --production` for the environment variable check to be effective.

### 6. Targeting Packages by Name Patterns

You can use `nameStartsWith`, `nameEndsWith`, and `nameMatch` to target packages based on their names:

```prolog
nameStartsWith("@my-company/") versionSatisfies ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0" if true;  # Packages starting with @my-company/ must be in the 1.x range
nameEndsWith("-component") versionSatisfies ">=0.5.0 <1.0.0" if true; # Component packages should be at least 0.5.0
nameMatch(".*-utils") versionSatisfies ">=2.0.0 <3.0.0" if true;  # Utils packages should be in the 2.x range
```

### 7. Ensuring Peer Dependency Compatibility

Constraints can help ensure that peer dependencies are compatible. For instance, if your package requires `react` as a peer dependency, you can ensure it aligns with the project's overall `react` version:

```prolog
peerDependencies.react == "17.0.2" if true; #Assuming global react is locked to 17.0.2
```

## Practical Example: A Monorepo Scenario

Consider a monorepo with the following structure:

```
monorepo/
├── packages/
│   ├── ui-components/
│   │   └── package.json
│   ├── api-client/
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── utils/
│       └── package.json
├── .yarn/
│   └── constraints.pro
└── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

You might have the following constraints in `.yarn/constraints.pro`:

```prolog
# Ensure all packages use the same version of lodash (if used)
"lodash" versionSatisfies "^4.17.0" if true;

# Ban the usage of moment.js in the ui-components package
forbidden "moment" if workspace(ui-components);

# Packages starting with "@my-company/" should be in the 1.x range
nameStartsWith("@my-company/") versionSatisfies ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0" if true;

# React version consistency. Adjust to your specific version.
"react" == "17.0.2" if true;
"react-dom" == "17.0.2" if true;
```

This example enforces a consistent version of `lodash`, bans `moment.js` in the UI components, and ensures that all packages starting with `@my-company/` adhere to a specific version range, and ensures a consistent React version across the board.

## Integrating with CI/CD

To ensure your constraints are always enforced, integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline. Add a step to your pipeline that runs `yarn install`. If any constraints are violated, the installation will fail, preventing the deployment of inconsistent code. This is crucial for maintaining long-term project health.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Start small:** Don't try to enforce too many constraints at once. Start with the most critical ones and gradually add more.
- **Test your constraints:** Experiment with different dependency versions and configurations to ensure your constraints are working as expected.
- **Document your constraints:** Add comments to your `.yarn/constraints.pro` file to explain the purpose of each constraint.
- **Consider the impact on upgrades:** Be mindful of how your constraints will affect future dependency upgrades. Avoid overly restrictive constraints that might make upgrades difficult.
- **Use descriptive package names:** Descriptive package names make it easier to target packages with `nameStartsWith`, `nameEndsWith`, and `nameMatch`.
- **Regularly review your constraints:** As your project evolves, review your constraints to ensure they are still relevant and effective.

## Troubleshooting

- **Yarn is not enforcing my constraints:** Make sure you're using Yarn Berry (v2+) and that the `.yarn/constraints.pro` file is in the correct location. Also, ensure you're running `yarn install` after making changes to the constraints file.
- **Conflicting constraints:** If you have conflicting constraints, Yarn will usually provide an error message indicating the conflict. Review your constraints and adjust them accordingly.
- **Constraints are too restrictive:** If you're having trouble upgrading dependencies due to overly restrictive constraints, consider relaxing the constraints or using semver ranges instead of exact versions.

## Conclusion

Yarn Constraints Query is a powerful tool for managing dependencies in JavaScript projects, particularly in monorepos and large-scale applications. By defining clear rules and policies, you can ensure consistent dependency versions, prevent the usage of unwanted packages, and promote best practices across your codebase. Implementing Yarn Constraints can significantly improve the maintainability, stability, and overall quality of your projects.
