# Solving the Two Sum Problem: A Comprehensive Guide with JavaScript Examples

The "Two Sum" problem is a classic and fundamental question in computer science, often used in coding interviews to assess a candidate's understanding of algorithms and data structures. It's a great starting point for learning about efficiency and optimization in problem-solving. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the problem, explain different approaches to solve it, and provide detailed JavaScript code examples.

## What is the Two Sum Problem?

The Two Sum problem can be stated as follows:

**Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices_ of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.**

**You may assume that each input would have _exactly_ one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.**

**You can return the answer in any order.**

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

## Understanding the Constraints

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to understand the constraints that can influence our approach:

- **Input Size:** The size of the `nums` array can vary. Knowing the maximum size helps us anticipate potential performance bottlenecks.
- **Target Value:** The range of possible `target` values can impact data types and potential overflow issues.
- **Uniqueness of Solution:** The problem statement guarantees exactly one solution. This simplifies our logic, as we can stop searching once we find a pair.
- **Same Element Restriction:** We cannot use the same element twice to reach the target. This needs to be explicitly handled in our code.

## Approach 1: Brute Force

The simplest approach is to iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the array and check if their sum equals the target. This is known as the brute force method.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Iterate through the `nums` array using a nested loop.
2.  For each pair of numbers `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (where `i != j`), check if `nums[i] + nums[j] === target`.
3.  If the sum equals the target, return the indices `[i, j]`.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
function twoSumBruteForce(nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) { // Start j from i+1 to avoid using the same element twice
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
        return [i, j];
      }
    }
  }
  // This should never happen given the problem constraints, but good practice to include
  return null;
}

// Example Usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
const result = twoSumBruteForce(nums, target);
console.log(result); // Output: [0, 1]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>) - Due to the nested loops, the algorithm's runtime grows quadratically with the input size `n`.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm uses constant extra space.

## Approach 2: Using a Hash Map (Optimal)

A more efficient approach utilizes a hash map (also known as a dictionary or associative array). We can iterate through the array once and store each number and its index in the hash map. For each number, we check if the complement (target - number) exists in the hash map. If it does, we have found our pair.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Create an empty hash map to store numbers and their indices.
2.  Iterate through the `nums` array.
3.  For each number `nums[i]`, calculate its complement: `complement = target - nums[i]`.
4.  Check if the `complement` exists as a key in the hash map.
    - If it exists, return the indices `[hashmap[complement], i]`.
    - If it doesn't exist, add `nums[i]` and its index `i` to the hash map.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
function twoSumHashMap(nums, target) {
  const numMap = new Map(); // Using a Map for better readability and guarantees insertion order
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  // This should never happen given the problem constraints, but good practice to include
  return null;
}

// Example Usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
const result = twoSumHashMap(nums, target);
console.log(result); // Output: [0, 1]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array only once, and hash map lookups take (on average) constant time.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst-case scenario, we might store all `n` numbers in the hash map.

## Approach 3: Using Sorting and Two Pointers (Less Common, But Demonstrates Sorting)

While less efficient than the hash map approach, this method demonstrates the use of sorting and the two-pointer technique. This approach _modifies_ the original array by sorting it. If modifying the input array is not allowed, this approach is not suitable.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Create a copy of the `nums` array and sort it. Let's call this `sortedNums`. We need to maintain the original indices, so we'll store pairs of `[value, index]` in `sortedNums`.
2.  Initialize two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the `sortedNums` array and `right` at the end.
3.  While `left < right`:
    - Calculate the sum `sum = sortedNums[left][0] + sortedNums[right][0]`.
    - If `sum === target`, we've found our pair. We need to retrieve the original indices from the stored index values.
    - If `sum < target`, increment `left` to increase the sum.
    - If `sum > target`, decrement `right` to decrease the sum.
4.  Return `null` if no solution is found.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
function twoSumSorted(nums, target) {
  // Create an array of [value, index] pairs
  const indexedNums = nums.map((value, index) => [value, index]);

  // Sort the array based on the value
  indexedNums.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  let left = 0;
  let right = indexedNums.length - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    const sum = indexedNums[left][0] + indexedNums[right][0];

    if (sum === target) {
      // Extract the original indices, handling the case where the same value appears twice
      let index1 = indexedNums[left][1];
      let index2 = indexedNums[right][1];

      // Ensure we return different indices
      return [index1, index2];

    } else if (sum < target) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }

  return null; // No solution found
}


// Example Usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
const result = twoSumSorted(nums, target);
console.log(result); // Output: [0, 1]  (or [1,0] - order doesn't matter)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Dominating factor is the sorting algorithm. Typical sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort have a time complexity of O(n log n). The two-pointer iteration is O(n), but it's dominated by the sorting.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - Creating the `indexedNums` array takes O(n) space. Some sorting algorithms might use additional space.

## Choosing the Right Approach

| Approach             | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity | Notes                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brute Force          | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1)             | Simplest to understand, but inefficient for large inputs.                                                                                                             |
| Hash Map             | O(n)             | O(n)             | Most efficient approach. Well-suited for larger datasets.                                                                                                             |
| Sorting + 2 Pointers | O(n log n)       | O(n)             | Useful for practicing sorting and two-pointer techniques. Modifies the array or requires a copy. Not as efficient as the hash map approach for this specific problem. |

In most cases, the **hash map approach is the preferred solution** for the Two Sum problem due to its optimal time complexity. The brute force method is only suitable for very small input sizes. The sorting approach can be useful if you're already working with a sorted array or want to practice sorting algorithms.

## Conclusion

The Two Sum problem is a valuable exercise in algorithm design and analysis. By understanding different approaches and their time and space complexities, you can choose the most appropriate solution for a given scenario. Mastering this problem is a great step towards becoming a more proficient software engineer, especially when preparing for technical interviews. Remember to consider the constraints and trade-offs of each approach before implementing a solution. Good luck!
