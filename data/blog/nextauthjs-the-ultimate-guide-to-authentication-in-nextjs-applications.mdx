## Core Concepts

Before diving into the implementation, it's important to understand the core concepts of NextAuth.js:

- **Providers:** Authentication providers (e.g., Google, GitHub, Credentials) that handle the authentication process.
- **Session:** A user's authenticated state, typically stored in a JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **Callbacks:** Functions that allow you to customize the authentication flow, such as handling user creation or modifying the session.
- **Adapter:** Persists user accounts, sessions, and verification requests to a database of your choosing.

## Setting Up NextAuth.js

Let's start by setting up NextAuth.js in your Next.js project:

1.  **Install the Package:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install next-auth
    # or
    yarn add next-auth
    # or
    pnpm add next-auth
    ```

2.  **Create the `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file:**

    This file acts as the main entry point for NextAuth.js. It handles all authentication requests.

    ```javascript
    // pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
    import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
    import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'

    export const authOptions = {
      providers: [
        GoogleProvider({
          clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
          clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
        }),
      ],
      secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET, // Important for production!
    }

    export default NextAuth(authOptions)
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**

    You'll need to set up environment variables for your OAuth provider credentials. For Google, you'll need `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. You'll also need `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. You can generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal. Add these to your `.env.local` file (or your hosting provider's environment variables):

    ```
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_SECURE_SECRET
    ```

    **Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to your Git repository! It contains sensitive information.

4.  **Configuration:**

    The `authOptions` object configures NextAuth.js. Let's break down the options we used:

    - `providers`: An array of authentication providers. We're using the `GoogleProvider` in this example. You'll need to configure the `clientId` and `clientSecret` from your Google Cloud Console project.
    - `secret`: A secret used to encrypt session tokens. **Crucially important for production environments!**

5.  **Get the `clientId` and `clientSecret` from your OAuth provider:**

    Each OAuth provider requires you to create an application within their platform. This will generate a client ID and client secret that you'll use to configure NextAuth.js. Refer to the documentation for your chosen provider (e.g., Google Cloud Console) for instructions. Make sure to configure the correct redirect URI, typically `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` during development and your production domain's equivalent in production.

## Implementing Social Logins

NextAuth.js makes it incredibly easy to integrate social logins. Let's expand on the Google example:

```javascript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'
import GithubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'

export const authOptions = {
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
}

export default NextAuth(authOptions)
```

To add GitHub login, you simply add the `GithubProvider` to the `providers` array and configure the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables obtained from your GitHub OAuth application.

## Using the `useSession` Hook

Now that you've configured NextAuth.js, you can use the `useSession` hook in your React components to access the user's session information:

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import { useSession, signIn, signOut } from 'next-auth/react'

export default function Home() {
  const { data: session } = useSession()

  if (session) {
    return (
      <div>
        Signed in as {session.user.email} <br />
        <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign out</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
  return (
    <div>
      Not signed in <br />
      <button onClick={() => signIn('google')}>Sign in with Google</button> <br />
      <button onClick={() => signIn('github')}>Sign in with GitHub</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- `useSession()`: This hook returns an object containing the user's session data, including the `user` object with `email`, `name`, and `image` properties.
- `signIn(provider)`: This function initiates the sign-in flow with the specified provider (e.g., "google", "github").
- `signOut()`: Signs the user out of the session.

## Database Adapters

Storing user data in a database is crucial for most applications. NextAuth.js provides adapters for various databases, including:

- Prisma
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- and more!

Let's look at how to configure the Prisma adapter. First, install the necessary packages:

```plaintext
npm install @next-auth/prisma-adapter prisma @prisma/client
# or
yarn add @next-auth/prisma-adapter prisma @prisma/client
# or
pnpm add @next-auth/prisma-adapter prisma @prisma/client
```

Then, initialize Prisma:

```plaintext
npx prisma init
```

This will create a `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file. Modify the `schema.prisma` file to include the NextAuth.js models. The NextAuth.js documentation provides a complete schema definition. Here's a simplified example:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql" // Or your database of choice
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Account {
  id                 String  @id @default(cuid())
  userId             String
  type               String
  provider           String
  providerAccountId  String
  refresh_token      String? @db.Text
  access_token       String? @db.Text
  expires_at         Int?
  token_type         String?
  scope              String?
  id_token           String? @db.Text
  session_state      String?

  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([provider, providerAccountId])
}

model Session {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  sessionToken String   @unique
  userId       String
  expires      DateTime
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String?   @unique
  emailVerified DateTime?
  image         String?
  accounts      Account[]
  sessions      Session[]
}

model VerificationToken {
  identifier String
  token      String   @unique
  expires    DateTime

  @@unique([identifier, token])
}
```

Next, run migrations:

```plaintext
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

Now, configure NextAuth.js to use the Prisma adapter:

```javascript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@next-auth/prisma-adapter'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

export const authOptions = {
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
}

export default NextAuth(authOptions)
```

Make sure you have the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable configured, pointing to your PostgreSQL database. You'll need to create the database separately.

With the Prisma adapter configured, NextAuth.js will automatically create users, sessions, and accounts in your database.

## Customizing JWTs

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to store session data in NextAuth.js. You can customize the JWT by adding custom claims or modifying the signing algorithm. You can customize the `jwt` and `session` callbacks:

```javascript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@next-auth/prisma-adapter'
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

export const authOptions = {
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, account, user }) {
      // Persist the OAuth access_token to the token right after signin
      if (account) {
        token.accessToken = account.access_token
      }
      if (user) {
        token.id = user.id // Add user ID to the JWT
      }
      return token
    },
    async session({ session, token, user }) {
      // Send properties to the client, like an access_token and user id from a provider.
      session.accessToken = token.accessToken
      session.user.id = token.id
      return session
    },
  },
}

export default NextAuth(authOptions)
```

In this example:

- The `jwt` callback is used to add the OAuth access token and the user ID to the JWT. This is triggered on sign in and subsequent token updates.
- The `session` callback is used to make the access token and user ID available in the `session` object accessible via the `useSession` hook. This ensures the client-side session contains the custom data.

## Advanced Configurations

NextAuth.js offers various advanced configuration options:

- **Custom Pages:** You can create custom sign-in, sign-out, and error pages.
- **Events:** Events are triggered during different stages of the authentication process, allowing you to perform custom actions.
- **Themes:** Customize the look and feel of the default sign-in page.

## Best Practices and Security Considerations

- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (e.g., client secrets, database credentials) in environment variables.
- **Secure Your Secret:** Protect your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` at all costs. If compromised, it could be used to forge authentication tokens.
- **Validate User Input:** Always validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
- **Use HTTPS:** Ensure your application is served over HTTPS to protect user data during transmission.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Regularly Update:** Keep NextAuth.js and its dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
- **Careful with Callbacks:** Be mindful of the data you expose through callbacks and ensure it's only what's necessary.
- **Proper Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in error messages.
