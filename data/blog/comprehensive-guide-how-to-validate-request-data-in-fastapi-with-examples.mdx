# Comprehensive Guide: How to Validate Request Data in FastAPI (with Examples)

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. One of its key strengths is its built-in data validation using Pydantic. This means you can define the expected structure and types of your request data directly within your Python code, and FastAPI will automatically handle the validation process for you. This post will provide a comprehensive guide on how to validate request data in FastAPI, covering different validation scenarios and providing practical code examples.

## Why Data Validation is Crucial

Data validation is a critical aspect of API development. It ensures that the data received by your API conforms to the expected format and constraints. Proper data validation helps to:

- **Prevent Errors:** By rejecting invalid data early on, you can avoid runtime errors and unexpected behavior in your API logic.
- **Enhance Security:** Validating input data can protect against injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. Malicious users often try to exploit poorly validated input to gain unauthorized access or manipulate your system.
- **Improve Data Quality:** Data validation ensures data consistency and accuracy, leading to more reliable and trustworthy results.
- **Provide Clear Feedback:** When validation fails, FastAPI provides informative error messages to the client, allowing them to correct their request.
- **Simplify Development:** By leveraging Pydantic's powerful validation capabilities, you can reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to handle data validation manually.

## Basic Data Validation with Pydantic

FastAPI relies on Pydantic for data validation. Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library that uses Python type hints to define data structures. Let's start with a simple example:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None  # Optional field
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    item_dict = item.model_dump() # or item.dict() if running older pydantic versions
    if item.tax:
        price_with_tax = item.price + item.tax
        item_dict.update({"price_with_tax": price_with_tax})
    return item_dict
```

In this example:

- We define a `Item` class that inherits from `BaseModel`.
- We declare the fields of the `Item` model with their corresponding types: `name` (string), `description` (optional string), `price` (float), and `tax` (optional float).
- FastAPI automatically uses this `Item` model to validate the request data when a POST request is made to `/items/`.
- If the request data does not conform to the `Item` model (e.g., `price` is a string instead of a float), FastAPI will automatically return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error with detailed validation error messages.

**Trying it out:**

Send a valid request:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Foo", "price": 50.2, "tax": 3.2}' http://localhost:8000/items/
```

Send an invalid request (price as string):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Foo", "price": "50.2", "tax": 3.2}' http://localhost:8000/items/
```

You'll notice the invalid request returns a detailed error, pointing out the type mismatch for the `price` field.

## Advanced Validation Techniques

Pydantic offers various advanced validation techniques to handle more complex scenarios:

### 1. Field Constraints

You can add constraints to your fields to enforce specific rules, such as minimum and maximum values, string lengths, or regular expression patterns.

```plaintext
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    user_id: int = Field(..., gt=0) # user_id must be greater than 0
    username: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=20)  # username must be between 3 and 20 characters
    email: str = Field(..., regex="^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$") #email must be a valid email address
    age: int | None = Field(None, gt=0, lt=150) # Optional field with age between 0 and 150
```

Here, we use the `Field` function from Pydantic to add constraints to the `user_id`, `username`, `email`, and `age` fields:

- `user_id` must be an integer greater than 0. The `...` means the field is required.
- `username` must be a string with a minimum length of 3 and a maximum length of 20. The `...` means the field is required.
- `email` must be a string that matches the specified regular expression, ensuring it's a valid email address format. The `...` means the field is required.
- `age` is an optional integer, and if present, must be greater than 0 and less than 150.

### 2. Custom Validators

Pydantic allows you to define custom validators to implement more complex validation logic. You can use `@validator` or `@root_validator` decorators.

- `@validator` validates a single field.
- `@root_validator` validates the entire model.

```plaintext
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator, ValidationError

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None

    @validator('price')
    def price_must_be_positive(cls, value):
        if value <= 0:
            raise ValueError('Price must be positive')
        return value

    @validator('name')
    def name_must_not_be_empty(cls, value):
        if not value.strip():  # Check if the name is empty after removing whitespace
            raise ValueError('Name cannot be empty or just whitespace')
        return value
```

In this example:

- We define a custom validator `price_must_be_positive` for the `price` field. This validator checks if the price is greater than 0. If not, it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message.
- We define a custom validator `name_must_not_be_empty` for the `name` field. This validator checks if the name is empty after removing whitespace. If it is, it raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message.

### 3. Root Validators

Root validators allow you to perform validation logic that depends on multiple fields in the model. They are useful for ensuring consistency and relationships between different data elements.

```plaintext
from pydantic import BaseModel, root_validator

class Item(BaseModel):
    start_date: str
    end_date: str

    @root_validator(pre=False)
    def validate_date_range(cls, values):
        start_date = values.get('start_date')
        end_date = values.get('end_date')

        if start_date and end_date:
            if start_date > end_date:
                raise ValueError('Start date cannot be after end date')
        return values
```

In this example, the `validate_date_range` validator checks if the `start_date` is before the `end_date`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. The `pre=False` ensures the other field-level validators run first.

### 4. Using `Query`, `Path`, and `Body` Parameters

FastAPI also provides `Query`, `Path`, and `Body` parameters to explicitly define how data is passed in the request and apply validation.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query, Path, Body
from typing import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(
    item_id: Annotated[int, Path(title="The ID of the item to get", gt=0)],
    q: Annotated[str | None, Query(alias="item-query", title="Query string", max_length=50)] = None
):
    results = {"item_id": item_id}
    if q:
        results.update({"q": q})
    return results

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(
    name: Annotated[str, Body(embed=True)],
    description: Annotated[str | None, Body(embed=True)] = None,
    price: Annotated[float, Body(embed=True, gt=0)]
):
    item = {"name": name, "description": description, "price": price}
    return item
```

- **Path Parameters (`Path`):** `item_id` is defined as a path parameter that must be an integer greater than 0. The `title` provides documentation.
- **Query Parameters (`Query`):** `q` is defined as a query parameter (optional) with an alias `item-query` (accessible as `/items/?item-query=your_query`), a title, and a maximum length of 50.
- **Request Body (`Body`):** In the `create_item` endpoint, `name`, `description`, and `price` are all part of the request body. `price` must be a float greater than 0. `embed=True` tells FastAPI to expect the data directly in the body rather than nested inside another field.

### 5. Using Enums for Limited Values

If a field can only have a limited number of predefined values, use Python's `Enum` class.

```plaintext
import enum
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Size(str, enum.Enum):
    SMALL = "small"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    LARGE = "large"

class Pizza(BaseModel):
    size: Size
    toppings: list[str]

pizza = Pizza(size="medium", toppings=["pepperoni", "mushrooms"])
print(pizza)

try:
    invalid_pizza = Pizza(size="extra-large", toppings=["pepperoni", "mushrooms"])
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

If the value passed to the `size` field isn't one of the enum values, a `ValueError` will be raised.

## Error Handling

When validation fails, FastAPI automatically returns an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error with detailed validation error messages. You can customize this error handling by creating your own exception handler.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=422,
        content={"detail": exc.errors()},
    )

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

In this example:

- We define an exception handler for `RequestValidationError` exceptions.
- The handler returns a JSON response with a status code of 422 and a detailed error message. The `exc.errors()` method provides a list of validation errors.

## Best Practices for Data Validation

- **Define Models Carefully:** Spend time crafting your Pydantic models to accurately represent the expected data structure and constraints. Consider all possible input scenarios.
- **Use Meaningful Error Messages:** Provide clear and informative error messages to help clients understand what went wrong and how to correct their requests. This improves the API usability.
- **Keep Validators Concise:** Break down complex validation logic into smaller, more manageable validators. This enhances code readability and maintainability.
- **Test Your Validation Rules:** Thoroughly test your validation rules with various input scenarios to ensure they are working as expected. Include both valid and invalid data.
- **Document Your Models:** Use docstrings to document the purpose and structure of your Pydantic models. This makes your API easier to understand and use.
