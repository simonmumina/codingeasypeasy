# Deploying NestJS Applications to AWS: A Comprehensive Guide

NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications, is becoming increasingly popular. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a robust and versatile platform for hosting these applications. This guide will explore various methods for deploying your NestJS application to AWS, ranging from traditional EC2 instances to serverless solutions with AWS Lambda.

## Choosing the Right Deployment Strategy

Before diving into the how-to, let's consider the various deployment options available on AWS and when you might choose each one:

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Offers the most control. You provision and manage your own virtual machines. Ideal for applications requiring specific configurations or high performance. Requires more management overhead.
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service):** Runs and manages Docker containers. Great for microservices and applications that benefit from containerization. Simplifies deployment and scaling.
- **Elastic Beanstalk:** A Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. AWS handles the infrastructure, and you provide your application code. Good for quick deployments and simplified management. Less control over underlying infrastructure.
- **Lambda (Serverless):** Executes code in response to events. Ideal for APIs, background tasks, and event-driven architectures. Scales automatically and is cost-effective for intermittent workloads. Requires restructuring your NestJS app for serverless compatibility.

This guide will cover EC2, Docker-based deployment (with simplified approach), and Lambda deployment. Let's get started!

## 1. Deploying to EC2

This approach gives you the most control over the server environment.

### Prerequisites:

- An AWS account
- Basic familiarity with AWS EC2
- SSH client (e.g., PuTTY, Terminal)

### Steps:

1.  **Launch an EC2 Instance:**

    - Navigate to the EC2 Management Console in the AWS console.
    - Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image). Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu Server are good choices.
    - Select an instance type (e.g., `t2.micro` for testing, `t3.medium` or larger for production).
    - Configure security groups to allow traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) if you'll be serving web content. **Crucially, allow inbound traffic on your NestJS application's port (e.g., 3000).**
    - Download the key pair. You'll need this to SSH into the instance.

2.  **SSH into the EC2 Instance:**

    Use your SSH client and the key pair to connect to the instance. The command will be similar to:

    ```plaintext
    ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip
    ```

    Replace `"your-key-pair.pem"` and `your-instance-public-ip` with the correct values.

3.  **Install Node.js and npm:**

    Update the package list:

    ```plaintext
    sudo yum update -y  # For Amazon Linux
    sudo apt update -y   # For Ubuntu
    ```

    Install Node.js and npm (using nvm for version management is highly recommended):

    ```plaintext
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
    source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    nvm install node  # Installs the latest version
    nvm use node
    ```

    Verify installation:

    ```plaintext
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

4.  **Transfer Your NestJS Application:**

    Use `scp` to securely copy your NestJS project to the EC2 instance:

    ```plaintext
    scp -r /path/to/your/nestjs-app ec2-user@your-instance-public-ip:/home/ec2-user/
    ```

5.  **Install Dependencies and Start the Application:**

    SSH back into the EC2 instance and navigate to your application directory:

    ```plaintext
    cd /home/ec2-user/your-nestjs-app
    npm install
    npm run build  # If you have a build step
    npm start     # Or npm run start:prod if you have a production script
    ```

6.  **Use a Process Manager (PM2):**

    PM2 keeps your application running even if it crashes and automatically restarts it on server reboot.

    ```plaintext
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start dist/main.js  --name "nestjs-app"  # Adjust dist/main.js if your entry point is different
    pm2 startup systemd  # Configure PM2 to start on boot
    pm2 save  # Save the current process list
    ```

7.  **Configure a Reverse Proxy (Nginx):**

    Install Nginx:

    ```plaintext
    sudo yum install nginx -y  # Amazon Linux
    sudo apt install nginx -y   # Ubuntu
    ```

    Create an Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/conf.d/nestjs.conf`):

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your-domain.com; # Replace with your domain

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Assuming your NestJS app runs on port 3000
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain name. Ensure your NestJS app port (3000 in this example) matches the `proxy_pass` value.

    Restart Nginx:

    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

    If you're using Amazon Linux 2, you might need to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic through the firewall:

    ```plaintext
    sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
    sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
    sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
    ```

8.  **Security Considerations:**

    - **Enable HTTPS:** Use Let's Encrypt with Certbot to obtain a free SSL certificate and configure Nginx to use it.
    - **Regular Security Updates:** Keep your OS and software packages up to date.
    - **Firewall:** Ensure your security group allows only necessary traffic.
    - **IAM Roles:** Use IAM roles to grant the EC2 instance permissions to access other AWS services.

## 2. Deploying with Docker

Docker simplifies deployment by packaging your application and its dependencies into a single container.

### Prerequisites:

- Docker installed on your local machine and on the EC2 instance.
- Basic knowledge of Docker.

### Steps:

1.  **Create a `Dockerfile`:**

    Place this file in the root of your NestJS project:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install

    COPY . .

    RUN npm run build

    FROM node:20-alpine AS production

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install --omit=dev

    COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

    EXPOSE 3000

    CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
    ```

2.  **Create a `.dockerignore` file:**

    This file prevents unnecessary files from being copied into the Docker image.

    ```
    node_modules
    dist
    .git
    .env
    ```

3.  **Build the Docker Image:**

    ```plaintext
    docker build -t nestjs-app .
    ```

4.  **Run the Docker Container (Locally for testing):**

    ```plaintext
    docker run -p 3000:3000 nestjs-app
    ```

5.  **Push the Docker Image to a Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR):**

    First, create a repository in your chosen registry. For example, on Docker Hub:

    ```plaintext
    docker tag nestjs-app your-dockerhub-username/nestjs-app:latest
    docker login -u your-dockerhub-username
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/nestjs-app:latest
    ```

6.  **Deploy to EC2 (or other container platforms like ECS):**

    - SSH into your EC2 instance.
    - Install Docker on the EC2 instance (if you haven't already).
    - Pull the Docker image:

      ```plaintext
      docker pull your-dockerhub-username/nestjs-app:latest
      ```

    - Run the Docker container:

      ```plaintext
      docker run -d -p 3000:3000 your-dockerhub-username/nestjs-app:latest
      ```

      - `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (background).
      - `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on the host (EC2 instance) to port 3000 inside the container.

    - Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy (as described in the EC2 deployment section) to forward traffic to the container.

## 3. Deploying to AWS Lambda (Serverless)

Deploying NestJS to Lambda requires some architectural adjustments, as Lambda functions are designed to be stateless and event-driven. You'll typically use API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function for HTTP requests.

### Prerequisites:

- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Serverless Framework installed (`npm install -g serverless`)
- A NestJS application

### Steps:

1.  **Install `serverless-http`:**

    This package allows you to wrap your NestJS application and run it within a Lambda function.

    ```plaintext
    npm install serverless-http --save
    ```

2.  **Modify your `main.ts` or `main.js` file:**

    ```plaintext
    // main.ts
    import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
    import { AppModule } from './app.module'
    import serverless from 'serverless-http'
    import { Context } from 'aws-lambda'

    let server: serverless.Handler

    async function bootstrap(): Promise<serverless.Handler> {
      if (!server) {
        const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
        await app.init() // Ensure app is initialized before wrapping
        const expressApp = app.getHttpAdapter().getInstance()
        server = serverless(expressApp)
      }
      return server
    }

    export const handler = async (event: any, context: Context) => {
      const cachedServer = await bootstrap() // Cache the server instance for performance
      return cachedServer(event, context)
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - We import `serverless-http`.
    - We create a `bootstrap` function that initializes the NestJS application only once (if `server` is null) and wraps it with `serverless()`. Caching the server is _crucial_ for performance, as it avoids re-initializing the NestJS app on every Lambda invocation.
    - The `handler` function is the entry point for the Lambda function. It calls `bootstrap` to get the server and then invokes the server with the `event` and `context` objects.

3.  **Create a `serverless.yml` file:**

    This file configures the Serverless Framework.

    ```plaintext
    service: nestjs-serverless-app

    provider:
      name: aws
      runtime: nodejs20.x # Choose the appropriate Node.js runtime
      region: your-aws-region # Replace with your AWS region
      stage: dev
      environment:
        NODE_ENV: production # Set environment variables
      iam:
        role:
          statements:
            - Effect: Allow
              Action:
                - logs:CreateLogGroup
                - logs:CreateLogStream
                - logs:PutLogEvents
              Resource: arn:aws:logs:${aws:region}:*:*

    functions:
      api:
        handler: dist/main.handler # Points to the handler function in your compiled code
        events:
          - http: ANY /
          - http: ANY {proxy+}

    plugins:
      - serverless-plugin-typescript
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `service`: Name of your service.
    - `provider`: Configures the AWS provider.
    - `runtime`: Specifies the Node.js runtime.
    - `region`: Your AWS region.
    - `environment`: Sets environment variables.
    - `iam`: Defines IAM permissions for the Lambda function. This example grants permission to write logs to CloudWatch.
    - `functions.api`: Defines the Lambda function that will handle API requests.
      - `handler`: Points to the `handler` function in your compiled NestJS code (`dist/main.js`).
      - `events`: Configures API Gateway to route all HTTP requests to the Lambda function. The `{proxy+}` allows for handling all routes defined in your NestJS application.
    - `plugins`: Includes the `serverless-plugin-typescript` plugin for compiling TypeScript code before deployment.

4.  **Install Serverless Plugin TypeScript (if using TypeScript):**

    ```plaintext
    npm install --save-dev serverless-plugin-typescript
    ```

5.  **Deploy the Application:**

    ```plaintext
    serverless deploy
    ```

    The Serverless Framework will package your application, create the necessary AWS resources (Lambda function, API Gateway), and deploy your code. The command will output the API Gateway endpoint URL.

6.  **Configure API Gateway (Alternative to `serverless.yml`):**

    If you need more control, you can manually configure API Gateway in the AWS console:

    - Create a new API Gateway.
    - Create a new resource and method (e.g., `GET /`).
    - Set the integration type to "Lambda Function."
    - Select the Lambda function you deployed.
    - Enable "Proxy integration" to pass all request data to the Lambda function.

### Considerations for Lambda Deployment:

- **Cold Starts:** Lambda functions can experience a delay (cold start) when they are invoked for the first time or after a period of inactivity. Optimize your code and use techniques like provisioned concurrency to mitigate cold starts. The cached server instance in `main.ts` is key to mitigating the impact of cold starts after the initial invocation.
- **Statelessness:** Lambda functions are stateless. Store persistent data in external services like databases (DynamoDB, RDS) or object storage (S3).
- **Function Size:** Keep your Lambda function package small to reduce deployment time and cold start latency. Use `.dockerignore` or `.serverlessignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- **Timeout:** Configure the Lambda function's timeout appropriately. If your application needs more time to process requests, increase the timeout value. Be mindful of cost implications.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Use CloudWatch Logs to monitor your Lambda function's performance and troubleshoot issues.

## CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

To automate your deployment process, integrate your NestJS application with a CI/CD pipeline. Popular options include:

- **AWS CodePipeline:** AWS's native CI/CD service.
- **GitHub Actions:** A popular CI/CD service integrated with GitHub.
- **Jenkins:** An open-source automation server.

The CI/CD pipeline should:

1.  Checkout the code from your repository.
2.  Run tests.
3.  Build the application.
4.  Package the application (e.g., create a Docker image or a deployment package for Lambda).
5.  Deploy the application to AWS.

## Conclusion

This guide provided several approaches to deploying NestJS applications to AWS. The best method depends on your specific requirements, such as the level of control needed, the scalability requirements, and the budget constraints. Remember to prioritize security best practices and automate your deployment process with CI/CD. Choose the option that best aligns with your team's expertise and project goals. With careful planning and execution, you can successfully deploy your NestJS application to the cloud and leverage the power of AWS.
