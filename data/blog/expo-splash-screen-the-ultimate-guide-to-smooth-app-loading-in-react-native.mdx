# Expo SplashScreen: The Ultimate Guide to Smooth App Loading in React Native

First impressions matter, especially when it comes to mobile applications. A well-designed splash screen can significantly enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback during the app loading process. This article provides a comprehensive guide to using `expo-splash-screen` in your React Native projects, covering everything from basic implementation to advanced customization techniques.

## What is Expo SplashScreen?

`expo-splash-screen` is a module provided by Expo that simplifies the process of creating and managing splash screens in React Native applications. It offers a cross-platform solution, allowing you to define a single splash screen configuration that works seamlessly on both iOS and Android.

**Key Benefits of using `expo-splash-screen`:**

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works consistently across iOS and Android.
- **Easy Configuration:** Simple and declarative API for defining splash screen properties.
- **Automatic Hiding:** Provides functions to automatically hide the splash screen when your app is ready.
- **Customization:** Offers options to customize the appearance of your splash screen, including image, background color, and resizing modes.
- **Improved User Experience:** Provides visual feedback during app loading, keeping users engaged.

## Installation and Setup

Before you can start using `expo-splash-screen`, you need to install the package. Make sure you have an Expo project set up. If not, you can create one using the following command:

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app my-app
cd my-app
```

Then, install the `expo-splash-screen` package:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-splash-screen
```

## Basic Implementation

The simplest way to implement a splash screen is to configure it in your `app.json` file. This approach requires no code changes in your JavaScript/TypeScript files, making it ideal for basic splash screen setups.

**1. Configure `app.json`:**

Open your `app.json` file and add the `splash` configuration:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "cover",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": ["**/*"],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
      }
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation of `splash` properties:**

- `image`: The path to your splash screen image. Place your image in the `assets` directory (or any directory you prefer and update the path accordingly). Recommended sizes are 1242x2688 for high-resolution displays.
- `resizeMode`: How the image should be resized to fit the screen. Common options include:
  - `cover`: Scales the image to fill the entire screen, potentially cropping it.
  - `contain`: Scales the image to fit within the screen, preserving its aspect ratio and potentially leaving empty space.
  - `stretch`: Stretches the image to fill the entire screen, potentially distorting it.
- `backgroundColor`: The background color of the splash screen. Use a hex code (e.g., `#ffffff` for white).

**2. Hide the Splash Screen:**

While the `app.json` configuration handles the initial display of the splash screen, you need to manually hide it when your app is ready. Use the `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` function for this purpose.

```javascript
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function prepare() {
      try {
        // Keep the splash screen visible while we fetch resources
        await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()
        // Pre-load data, assets, etc.  This could involve fetching data from an API,
        // loading fonts, etc.
        // Replace this with your actual app initialization logic
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)) // Simulate loading
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e)
      } finally {
        // Tell the application to render
        await SplashScreen.hideAsync()
      }
    }

    prepare()
  }, [])

  return (
    // Your app content goes here
    //For example:
    //<View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    //  <Text>My App</Text>
    //</View>
    null
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`:** This function prevents the splash screen from automatically hiding until you explicitly call `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`. It's crucial to call this _before_ your app starts loading data.
- **`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`:** This function hides the splash screen. Call it when your app is fully initialized and ready to be displayed. It's best to call this within a `finally` block to ensure it's always executed, even if an error occurs during initialization.
- **`useEffect`:** The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in your functional component. In this case, it's used to prevent auto-hiding of the splash screen and then hide it when the app is ready.
- **`prepare()`:** An async function that encapsulates the logic for preventing auto hiding, performing any necessary initialization tasks (e.g., fetching data, loading assets), and finally hiding the splash screen. Wrapping the code in an async function is good practice for handling asynchronous operations.
- **Error Handling:** The `try...catch...finally` block provides error handling, ensuring that the splash screen is hidden even if an error occurs during the app loading process.

## Advanced Customization

`expo-splash-screen` offers several advanced customization options to fine-tune the appearance and behavior of your splash screen:

**1. `dark` and `light` Modes:**

You can define separate splash screen configurations for dark and light modes. This allows your splash screen to adapt to the user's system preferences.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "cover",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "cover",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
      "dark": {
        "image": "./assets/splash-dark.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#000000"
      }
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": ["**/*"],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
      }
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `dark` property within the `splash` object specifies a different image (`splash-dark.png`) and background color (`#000000`) to be used when the user's device is in dark mode.

**2. Programmatic Control:**

You can control the splash screen programmatically using the `SplashScreen` API. This gives you more flexibility in managing the splash screen's visibility.

```javascript
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function prepare() {
      try {
        await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()
        // Simulate loading data
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e)
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false)
      }
    }

    prepare()
  }, [])

  const onHideSplashScreen = async () => {
    await SplashScreen.hideAsync()
  }

  if (isLoading) {
    return null // or return a custom loading indicator
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>App Loaded!</Text>
      <Button title="Hide Splash Screen" onPress={onHideSplashScreen} />
    </View>
  )
}
```

In this example:

- The `isLoading` state variable tracks whether the app is still loading.
- The splash screen is initially prevented from hiding.
- After simulating a 3-second loading period, `setIsLoading(false)` is called.
- The `onHideSplashScreen` function explicitly hides the splash screen when the button is pressed.

**3. Using with Expo Router**

If you're using Expo Router, things become even easier! Expo Router provides a built-in way to handle splash screens and ensures your routes are properly loaded before revealing the content. The setup is similar to the above examples, but the timing and placement might be a bit different based on how you are managing your routes.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Simple:** A splash screen should be visually appealing but not overly complex. Avoid animations or excessive information that can distract the user.
- **Use High-Resolution Images:** Ensure your splash screen images are of high resolution to look sharp on all devices.
- **Optimize Image Size:** Optimize your splash screen images to reduce their file size. Large images can increase app loading time.
- **Provide Feedback:** If your app takes a significant amount of time to load, consider adding a loading indicator or progress bar to the splash screen to provide feedback to the user. While `expo-splash-screen` itself doesn't directly provide progress bar functionality, you can create a custom component and overlay it on the splash screen area using conditional rendering based on loading state.
- **Match App Theme:** Ensure that your splash screen's design aligns with your app's overall theme and branding.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your splash screen on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks good and functions correctly. Pay attention to how the `resizeMode` property affects the image's appearance on various devices.
- **Hide Quickly:** The goal is to hide the splash screen as soon as your app is ready to provide a seamless user experience. Avoid delaying the hiding of the splash screen unnecessarily.

## Troubleshooting

- **Splash Screen Not Showing:** Double-check that you've correctly configured the `splash` object in your `app.json` file and that the image path is correct. Also, ensure you have rebuilt your app after making changes to `app.json`. Run `npx expo prebuild` to update native files.
- **Splash Screen Showing Incorrectly:** Verify the `resizeMode` property to ensure the image is being displayed as intended. Experiment with different `resizeMode` options (e.g., `cover`, `contain`, `stretch`) to find the best fit for your image and screen size.
- **Splash Screen Not Hiding:** Make sure you're calling `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` when your app is ready. Also, check for any errors that might be preventing the function from being executed. Use console.log statements to debug the execution flow and ensure that all necessary asynchronous operations have completed before calling `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`.
- **Image Resolution Issues:** If your splash screen image looks blurry, ensure it's a high-resolution image and that you haven't accidentally scaled it down during the resizing process.

## Conclusion

`expo-splash-screen` simplifies the implementation and customization of splash screens in React Native applications. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this article, you can create a visually appealing and engaging splash screen that enhances the user experience and improves app retention. Remember to focus on simplicity, optimization, and thorough testing to achieve the best results. A well-designed splash screen is a small detail that can make a big difference in the overall perception of your app.
