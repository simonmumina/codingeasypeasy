# How to Send Emails with Nodemailer using Gmail in Node.js (Step-by-Step Guide)

Sending emails from your Node.js application is a common requirement for features like user registration, password resets, notifications, and more. Nodemailer is a popular Node.js module that simplifies the process of sending emails. This guide will walk you through using Nodemailer with a Gmail account to send emails effectively and securely.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:** You should have Node.js version 14 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **A Gmail account:** You'll need a Gmail account to send emails from. Note that Gmail's security policies might require you to enable "Less secure app access" or use "App passwords" (recommended) if you're not using OAuth2. We'll cover this in the security section.
- **Basic JavaScript knowledge:** Familiarity with JavaScript syntax and asynchronous programming (promises/async/await) is essential.

## Step 1: Project Setup

First, let's create a new Node.js project and install Nodemailer.

1.  **Create a project directory:**

    ```plaintext
    mkdir nodemailer-gmail-example
    cd nodemailer-gmail-example
    ```

2.  **Initialize a new Node.js project:**

    ```plaintext
    npm init -y
    ```

3.  **Install Nodemailer:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install nodemailer
    ```

## Step 2: Setting up Nodemailer

Now that we have our project set up, let's create a file (e.g., `mailer.js`) to house our Nodemailer configuration.

```plaintext
// mailer.js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')

async function sendEmail(to, subject, text, html) {
  // Create a transporter object using Gmail SMTP
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
      user: 'your_email@gmail.com', // Your Gmail address
      pass: 'your_gmail_password', // Your Gmail password or App Password (recommended)
    },
  })

  // Define the email options
  const mailOptions = {
    from: 'your_email@gmail.com', // Sender address
    to: to, // Recipient address
    subject: subject, // Subject line
    text: text, // Plain text body
    html: html, // HTML body (optional)
  }

  // Send the email
  try {
    const info = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response)
    return info
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email: ', error)
    throw error
  }
}

module.exports = { sendEmail }
```

**Explanation:**

- **`require('nodemailer')`:** Imports the Nodemailer module.
- **`createTransport()`:** Creates a transport object that will be used to send emails. We're configuring it to use Gmail's SMTP server.
  - `service: 'gmail'`: Specifies that we're using Gmail's SMTP service. Nodemailer knows the default settings for Gmail, making the configuration easier.
  - `auth`: Contains the authentication credentials. Replace `'your_email@gmail.com'` and `'your_gmail_password'` with your actual Gmail address and password (or App Password). **Important: Using your regular Gmail password is discouraged for security reasons. See the "Security Considerations" section below.**
- **`mailOptions`:** An object containing the details of the email you want to send:
  - `from`: The sender's email address.
  - `to`: The recipient's email address.
  - `subject`: The email subject.
  - `text`: The plain text version of the email body.
  - `html`: (Optional) The HTML version of the email body. If both `text` and `html` are provided, the email client will choose the best format to display.
- **`transporter.sendMail()`:** Sends the email using the configured transporter and mail options. It returns a promise that resolves with information about the sent email or rejects with an error.
- **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during the email sending process, logging the error to the console.
- **Module Exports:** The `sendEmail` function is exported, making it available for use in other parts of your application.

## Step 3: Using the `sendEmail` function

Now, let's create another file (e.g., `app.js`) to use the `sendEmail` function we created.

```plaintext
// app.js
const { sendEmail } = require('./mailer')

async function main() {
  try {
    const info = await sendEmail(
      'recipient_email@example.com', // Replace with the recipient's email address
      'Hello from Nodemailer!', // Subject
      'This is a plain text email sent using Nodemailer with Gmail.', // Text body
      '<p>This is an HTML email sent using Nodemailer with Gmail.</p>' // HTML body
    )

    console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send email:', error)
  }
}

main()
```

**Explanation:**

- **`require('./mailer')`:** Imports the `sendEmail` function from the `mailer.js` file.
- **`sendEmail()` call:** Calls the `sendEmail` function with the recipient's email address, subject, text body, and HTML body as arguments. **Remember to replace `recipient_email@example.com` with a valid email address.**
- **`info.messageId`:** If the email is sent successfully, the `info` object contains information about the sent message, including its `messageId`.
- **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block catches any errors that might occur during the email sending process and logs them to the console.

## Step 4: Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```plaintext
node app.js
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should see a "Email sent: ..." message in the console, and the recipient should receive the email.

## Security Considerations (Important!)

Using your regular Gmail password directly in your code is **highly discouraged** due to security risks. Instead, use one of the following methods:

**1. App Passwords (Recommended)**

Gmail allows you to create app-specific passwords, which are unique passwords that can only be used by a specific application. This is a much safer option than using your main Gmail password.

- **Enable 2-Step Verification:** First, you need to enable 2-Step Verification on your Gmail account. Go to your Google Account settings -> Security -> 2-Step Verification.
- **Create an App Password:** Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, you'll see an "App passwords" option. Click on it, select "Mail" as the app, and "Other (custom name)" as the device. Give it a name like "Nodemailer App" and generate the password.
- **Use the App Password:** Use the generated App Password in your `mailer.js` file instead of your regular Gmail password.

**Example:**

```plaintext
auth: {
  user: 'your_email@gmail.com',
  pass: 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD'  // Replace with your App Password
}
```

**2. OAuth2 (More Complex, but most secure)**

OAuth2 is a more secure authentication protocol that allows your application to access your Gmail account without storing your password. This requires a more complex setup involving creating a Google Cloud project, enabling the Gmail API, and obtaining OAuth2 credentials.

- **Google Cloud Project:** Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console ([https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)).
- **Enable Gmail API:** In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the API Library and enable the Gmail API.
- **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID:** Create OAuth 2.0 credentials with a "Desktop app" type.
- **Install `google-auth-library`:** Install the `google-auth-library` package: `npm install google-auth-library`

Here's a simplified example (requires more setup and handling of token refresh):

```plaintext
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')
const { google } = require('googleapis')

// These id's and secrets should come from your google cloud project.
const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com'
const CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
const REDIRECT_URI = 'https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground' // Or a URL you control
const REFRESH_TOKEN = 'YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN' // Obtained during initial OAuth flow

async function sendEmail(to, subject, text, html) {
  const oAuth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI)
  oAuth2Client.setCredentials({ refresh_token: REFRESH_TOKEN })

  try {
    const accessToken = await oAuth2Client.getAccessToken()

    const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
      service: 'gmail',
      auth: {
        type: 'OAuth2',
        user: 'your_email@gmail.com',
        clientId: CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET,
        refreshToken: REFRESH_TOKEN,
        accessToken: accessToken,
      },
    })

    const mailOptions = {
      from: 'your_email@gmail.com',
      to: to,
      subject: subject,
      text: text,
      html: html,
    }

    const info = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response)
    return info
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending email: ', error)
    throw error
  }
}

module.exports = { sendEmail }
```

**Obtaining the Refresh Token:**

1.  Go to the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground).
2.  Click the settings icon in the top right and check "Use your own OAuth credentials".
3.  Enter your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret.
4.  Select the Gmail API v1.
5.  Authorize the API.
6.  Exchange the authorization code for tokens. The refresh token will be displayed. **Treat this token like a password!**

**Important Considerations for OAuth2:**

- Storing credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management system) is crucial.
- You'll need to handle token refresh logic, as access tokens expire.
- This is a more complex setup, but it's the most secure way to integrate with Gmail.

**3. Environment Variables:**

Regardless of whether you are using App passwords or OAuth2, store your sensitive credentials (email address, password/app password, client ID, client secret, refresh token) in environment variables. This prevents them from being hardcoded in your application.

**Example (using `.env` file and `dotenv` package):**

1.  **Install `dotenv`:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install dotenv
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:**

    ```
    EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
    EMAIL_PASS=YOUR_APP_PASSWORD
    ```

3.  **Load environment variables in your `mailer.js` file:**

    ```plaintext
    require('dotenv').config()

    const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')

    async function sendEmail(to, subject, text, html) {
      const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
        service: 'gmail',
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
        },
      })

      // ... rest of the code ...
    }
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Error: Invalid login" or "Username and Password not accepted":** This usually means the Gmail credentials you provided are incorrect. Double-check your email address and password (or App Password). Also, ensure that "Less secure app access" is enabled (if you're not using App Passwords) or that you're properly using OAuth2.
- **"Error: Connection timed out":** This could be due to network issues or your firewall blocking the connection to Gmail's SMTP server.
- **Emails ending up in spam:** This is a common issue. To improve email deliverability:
  - **Use a dedicated email sending service:** Consider using a service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES for more reliable email delivery.
  - **Set up SPF and DKIM records:** These DNS records help verify that your emails are legitimate.
  - **Use a custom domain:** Sending emails from a custom domain instead of a generic Gmail address can improve deliverability.
  - **Follow email best practices:** Avoid using spam trigger words, ensure your emails are properly formatted, and provide an easy way for recipients to unsubscribe.
- **Rate Limiting:** Gmail has rate limits on sending emails. If you're sending a large number of emails, you might hit these limits. Consider using a dedicated email sending service for high-volume sending.

## Conclusion

This guide provided a step-by-step approach to sending emails from your Node.js application using Nodemailer and a Gmail account. Remember to prioritize security by using App Passwords or OAuth2 and storing your credentials securely. For production environments and high-volume email sending, consider using a dedicated email sending service for improved deliverability and reliability. By following these guidelines, you can effectively integrate email functionality into your Node.js applications.
