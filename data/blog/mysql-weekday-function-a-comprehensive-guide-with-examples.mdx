# MySQL WEEKDAY() Function: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The `WEEKDAY()` function in MySQL is a powerful tool for extracting information about the day of the week from a given date. This guide provides a deep dive into the `WEEKDAY()` function, explaining its purpose, syntax, usage, and providing practical examples to help you master this essential MySQL function.

## What is the MySQL WEEKDAY() Function?

The `WEEKDAY()` function returns the day of the week index for a given date. The index ranges from 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday). This is different from `DAYOFWEEK()` which returns 1 (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday).  Understanding the difference is crucial to ensure your queries return the correct results.

## Syntax

The syntax for the `WEEKDAY()` function is straightforward:

```sql
WEEKDAY(date)
```

Where `date` is the date or datetime value you want to analyze.  The `date` argument can be:

*   A date literal (e.g., '2024-03-01')
*   A datetime literal (e.g., '2024-03-01 10:00:00')
*   A column containing date or datetime values
*   The result of another function that returns a date or datetime

## Return Value

The `WEEKDAY()` function returns an integer representing the day of the week, as follows:

*   **0:** Monday
*   **1:** Tuesday
*   **2:** Wednesday
*   **3:** Thursday
*   **4:** Friday
*   **5:** Saturday
*   **6:** Sunday

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to illustrate how to use the `WEEKDAY()` function.

**Example 1: Getting the Weekday of a Specific Date**

```sql
SELECT WEEKDAY('2024-03-01');
-- Output: 4 (Friday)
```

This query will return `4`, indicating that March 1st, 2024, is a Friday.

**Example 2: Getting the Weekday from a Datetime Value**

```sql
SELECT WEEKDAY('2024-03-02 14:30:00');
-- Output: 5 (Saturday)
```

This query demonstrates that the `WEEKDAY()` function works equally well with datetime values.  It extracts the date portion and calculates the weekday.

**Example 3: Using WEEKDAY() with a Column in a Table**

Assume you have a table called `orders` with a column named `order_date` of type `DATE`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  order_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_date) VALUES
('2024-02-26'), -- Monday
('2024-02-27'), -- Tuesday
('2024-02-28'), -- Wednesday
('2024-02-29'); -- Thursday

SELECT order_id, order_date, WEEKDAY(order_date) AS weekday_index
FROM orders;
```

This query will return a table with the `order_id`, `order_date`, and the weekday index for each order. The output would be similar to:

| order\_id | order\_date | weekday\_index |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------------- |
| 1         | 2024-02-26  | 0              |
| 2         | 2024-02-27  | 1              |
| 3         | 2024-02-28  | 2              |
| 4         | 2024-02-29  | 3              |

**Example 4: Filtering Data Based on Weekday**

Let's say you want to retrieve all orders placed on a Wednesday (weekday index 2).

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE WEEKDAY(order_date) = 2;
```

This query will return all orders where the `order_date` falls on a Wednesday.

**Example 5: Using WEEKDAY() in a `GROUP BY` Clause**

You can use `WEEKDAY()` to group data based on the day of the week.  For instance, to count the number of orders placed on each day of the week:

```sql
SELECT WEEKDAY(order_date) AS weekday_index, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY WEEKDAY(order_date)
ORDER BY WEEKDAY(order_date);
```

This query will return a table showing the number of orders placed on each day of the week, with the weekday index as the key.  You can use a `CASE` statement to display the day name instead of the index for better readability.

```sql
SELECT
    CASE WEEKDAY(order_date)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Monday'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Tuesday'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Wednesday'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Thursday'
        WHEN 4 THEN 'Friday'
        WHEN 5 THEN 'Saturday'
        WHEN 6 THEN 'Sunday'
    END AS day_of_week,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY FIELD(day_of_week, 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday');
```

This improves readability by displaying the day names.  The `ORDER BY FIELD()` clause ensures the results are displayed in the correct order of the week.

**Example 6: Using WEEKDAY() with `CURDATE()`**

To find out the weekday for today's date:

```sql
SELECT WEEKDAY(CURDATE());
```

This query returns the weekday index for the current date.

## Important Considerations

*   **Weekday Index:** Remember that the `WEEKDAY()` function returns 0 for Monday and 6 for Sunday.  Plan your queries accordingly.
*   **Date/Datetime Formats:** Ensure that the `date` argument passed to the `WEEKDAY()` function is in a valid date or datetime format that MySQL can recognize.
*   **Time Zones:** `WEEKDAY()` function uses the MySQL server's time zone settings.  Be aware of potential time zone issues if your data spans multiple time zones.
*   **Comparison with DAYOFWEEK():**  As mentioned earlier, `WEEKDAY()` and `DAYOFWEEK()` return different ranges.  Choose the function that aligns with the indexing you require.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Aliases:** When using `WEEKDAY()` in a `SELECT` statement, use aliases to give meaningful names to the resulting columns (e.g., `WEEKDAY(order_date) AS weekday_index`). This enhances readability and maintainability.
*   **Consistency:**  Maintain consistency in your code by using `WEEKDAY()` or `DAYOFWEEK()` consistently throughout your application. Avoid mixing them unless there's a specific reason to do so.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your queries to ensure that the `WEEKDAY()` function is working as expected, especially when dealing with edge cases or complex logic.
*   **Documentation:** Document your code clearly, explaining how you're using the `WEEKDAY()` function and why. This helps other developers (and yourself in the future) understand your code.

## Conclusion

The `WEEKDAY()` function is a valuable tool in MySQL for extracting the day of the week from dates. By understanding its syntax, return values, and practical applications, you can effectively use it to analyze and manipulate date data in your MySQL databases.  Remember to consider the weekday indexing (0-6) and the difference between `WEEKDAY()` and `DAYOFWEEK()` to avoid unexpected results. With the examples and best practices provided in this guide, you are well-equipped to leverage the power of the `WEEKDAY()` function in your MySQL projects.
