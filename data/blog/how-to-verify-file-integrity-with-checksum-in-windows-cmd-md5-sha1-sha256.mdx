# How to Verify File Integrity with Checksum in Windows CMD (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)

In today's digital age, ensuring the integrity of your files is paramount. Whether you're downloading software, receiving important documents, or transferring data, you need to be confident that the file you receive is exactly what the sender intended and hasn't been corrupted or tampered with. Checksums are a powerful tool for verifying file integrity. This guide will walk you through how to use the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) and PowerShell to generate and verify checksums for your files using MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 algorithms.

## What is a Checksum?

A checksum is a small, fixed-size piece of data derived from a file. It acts like a unique fingerprint for that file. If even a single bit of the file changes, the checksum will be completely different. This allows you to compare the checksum of a file you received with the original checksum provided by the source to confirm its integrity. Common hashing algorithms used for checksums include MD5, SHA1, and SHA256. SHA256 is generally considered more secure than MD5 and SHA1.

## Why is File Integrity Important?

- **Preventing Corruption:** Files can become corrupted during download, transfer, or storage. Checksum verification can identify corrupted files so you can obtain a fresh copy.
- **Detecting Tampering:** Malicious actors can modify files to inject malware or alter data. Checksum verification can detect these unauthorized changes.
- **Ensuring Authenticity:** Verifying the checksum against the source ensures the file you have is the genuine article, not a fake or altered version.
- **Compliance and Auditing:** In some industries, verifying file integrity is a regulatory requirement for maintaining data integrity and audit trails.

## Using Windows Command Prompt (CMD) to Calculate Checksums

While CMD doesn't have a built-in checksum generator like PowerShell, we can use a workaround by leveraging the `certutil` command.

### Calculating MD5 Checksum with CMD

The `certutil` command is a versatile utility that can be used for certificate management, and it also has the ability to calculate cryptographic hashes.

1.  **Open CMD:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

2.  **Navigate to the File:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing the file you want to check. For example:

    ```plaintext
    cd C:\Downloads
    ```

3.  **Calculate the MD5 Hash:** Use the following command, replacing `filename.ext` with the actual name of your file:

    ```plaintext
    certutil -hashfile filename.ext MD5
    ```

    Example:

    ```plaintext
    certutil -hashfile mydocument.pdf MD5
    ```

    The output will show the MD5 hash of the file.

### Calculating SHA1 Checksum with CMD

The process is the same as calculating the MD5 hash, but you'll specify `SHA1` instead of `MD5`.

1.  **Open CMD:** (as described above)

2.  **Navigate to the File:** (as described above)

3.  **Calculate the SHA1 Hash:**

    ```plaintext
    certutil -hashfile filename.ext SHA1
    ```

    Example:

    ```plaintext
    certutil -hashfile install.exe SHA1
    ```

### Calculating SHA256 Checksum with CMD

Similarly, for SHA256:

1.  **Open CMD:** (as described above)

2.  **Navigate to the File:** (as described above)

3.  **Calculate the SHA256 Hash:**

    ```plaintext
    certutil -hashfile filename.ext SHA256
    ```

    Example:

    ```plaintext
    certutil -hashfile image.jpg SHA256
    ```

## Using PowerShell to Calculate Checksums

PowerShell provides a more streamlined way to calculate checksums with the `Get-FileHash` cmdlet.

### Calculating MD5 Checksum with PowerShell

1.  **Open PowerShell:** Press `Win + R`, type `powershell`, and press Enter.

2.  **Calculate the MD5 Hash:** Use the following command, replacing `"C:\path\to\your\file.ext"` with the full path to your file:

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 -Path "C:\path\to\your\file.ext"
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 -Path "C:\Downloads\mysoftware.zip"
    ```

    The output will display the algorithm used and the hash value.

### Calculating SHA1 Checksum with PowerShell

1.  **Open PowerShell:** (as described above)

2.  **Calculate the SHA1 Hash:**

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1 -Path "C:\path\to\your\file.ext"
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA1 -Path "C:\Documents\report.docx"
    ```

### Calculating SHA256 Checksum with PowerShell

1.  **Open PowerShell:** (as described above)

2.  **Calculate the SHA256 Hash:**

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path "C:\path\to\your\file.ext"
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path "C:\Videos\tutorial.mp4"
    ```

### Simplified PowerShell using just file name

If you're already in the directory where the file is located, you can just use the filename instead of the full path. First use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the file is located. Then:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path "filename.ext"
```

## Verifying File Integrity: Comparing Checksums

Once you've calculated the checksum of a file, you need to compare it to the original checksum provided by the source.

1.  **Obtain the Original Checksum:** The original checksum is usually provided by the source of the file, often on a download page or in accompanying documentation.

2.  **Compare the Checksums:** Visually compare the checksum you generated with the original checksum. If they match exactly, the file is considered intact. If they don't match, the file is either corrupted or has been tampered with.

## Example Scenario: Verifying a Software Download

Let's say you're downloading a software package called `MySoftware.exe` from a website. The website provides the following SHA256 checksum:

```
A1B2C3D4E5F678901234567890ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
```

1.  **Download the Software:** Download `MySoftware.exe` to your computer (e.g., to your `Downloads` folder).

2.  **Open PowerShell:**

3.  **Calculate the SHA256 Checksum:**

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path "C:\Downloads\MySoftware.exe"
    ```

4.  **Compare the Checksums:** Carefully compare the `Hash` value returned by PowerShell to the SHA256 checksum provided on the website. If they match perfectly, you can be reasonably confident that the `MySoftware.exe` file you downloaded is the genuine article. If they don't match, you should download the file again, preferably from a different source if available, or contact the website support.

## Security Considerations

- **Choose Strong Algorithms:** SHA256 is generally considered more secure than MD5 and SHA1, which have known vulnerabilities. Use SHA256 whenever possible.
- **Trust the Source:** The integrity of your verification depends on the trustworthiness of the source providing the original checksum. If you don't trust the source, the checksum verification is meaningless.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** While checksums protect against data corruption, they don't protect against man-in-the-middle attacks if the checksum itself is intercepted and replaced with a modified one. Always use HTTPS for secure downloads and verify checksums over secure channels.

## Conclusion

Verifying file integrity using checksums is a simple but crucial practice for ensuring the security and reliability of your data. By using the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell and the `certutil` and `Get-FileHash` commands, you can easily generate and compare checksums to detect file corruption or tampering. Make checksum verification a standard part of your workflow, especially when downloading software or handling sensitive data. Always prioritize stronger hashing algorithms like SHA256 for increased security.
