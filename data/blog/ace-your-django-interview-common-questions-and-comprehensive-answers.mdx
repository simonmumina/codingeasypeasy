## Basic Django Concepts

### What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the MTV (Model-Template-View) architectural pattern and provides a rich set of features, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), template engine, URL routing, and security features.

### What are the key features of Django?

Key features of Django include:

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** Allows you to interact with the database using Python code.
- **Template Engine:** Provides a way to dynamically generate HTML.
- **URL Routing:** Maps URLs to specific views.
- **Security Features:** Built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.
- **Admin Interface:** A powerful and customizable admin interface for managing your data.
- **Form Handling:** Provides tools for creating and processing HTML forms.
- **Internationalization & Localization:** Support for creating multilingual applications.
- **Middleware:** A flexible way to process requests and responses.

### What is the Django MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture?

MTV is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected parts:

- **Model:** Represents the data structure and interacts with the database.
- **Template:** Defines the presentation layer (how the data is displayed to the user).
- **View:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and the template, handling user requests, fetching data from the model, and rendering the template.

It's important to note the difference between Django's MTV and the more commonly known MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. In Django, the "View" handles the logic, acting more like a Controller, and the "Template" handles the presentation.

### What is a Django model?

A Django model is a Python class that represents a database table. It defines the structure of the data (fields) and provides methods for interacting with the database (e.g., creating, reading, updating, and deleting data).

### What is a Django view?

A Django view is a Python function or class that receives a web request and returns a web response. It handles the business logic of the application, interacts with the models to retrieve or modify data, and renders a template to generate the HTML response.

### What is a Django template?

A Django template is a text file (usually HTML) that contains placeholders for dynamic content. It uses Django's template language to inject data from the view into the HTML, creating the final output that is sent to the user's browser.

### What is the purpose of `manage.py`?

`manage.py` is a command-line utility that helps you manage your Django project. It provides various commands for tasks such as:

- `runserver`: Starts the development server.
- `migrate`: Applies database migrations.
- `makemigrations`: Creates new database migrations.
- `createsuperuser`: Creates a superuser account for the admin interface.
- `test`: Runs the project's tests.
- `shell`: Opens a Python shell with the Django environment loaded.

### What is `settings.py` and what kind of settings can you define there?

`settings.py` is a Python module that contains all the configuration settings for your Django project. It defines things like:

- `DEBUG`: Enables or disables debug mode.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for cryptographic signing. **Important:** Keep this secret!
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: A list of hostnames that are allowed to serve the application.
- `DATABASES`: Configuration for the database connection.
- `INSTALLED_APPS`: A list of installed Django apps.
- `MIDDLEWARE`: A list of middleware components.
- `TEMPLATES`: Configuration for the template engine.
- `STATIC_URL`: The URL prefix for static files.
- `STATIC_ROOT`: The directory where static files are collected for deployment.
- `MEDIA_URL`: The URL prefix for user-uploaded media files
- `MEDIA_ROOT`: The directory where user-uploaded media files are stored.
- `TIME_ZONE`: The timezone for your application.
- `LANGUAGE_CODE`: The language code for your application.

### How do you handle static files in Django?

Static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) are handled in Django using the `STATIC_URL` and `STATIC_ROOT` settings.

1.  **`STATIC_URL`**: Defines the URL prefix for static files. For example, if `STATIC_URL = '/static/'`, then static files will be served from URLs like `/static/css/style.css`.

2.  **`STATIC_ROOT`**: Specifies the directory where static files are collected for deployment. You use the `collectstatic` command to copy all static files from your apps and other locations to this directory. This directory is typically served by a web server like Nginx or Apache in production.

3.  **`STATICFILES_DIRS`**: A list of directories where Django will search for static files in addition to the `static` directories in each app.

**Example in `settings.py`:**

```plaintext
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'my_static_files'),
]
```

**In your templates:**

```plaintext
{% load static %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}" />
<img src="{% static 'images/logo.png' %}" alt="Logo" />
```

**Collecting static files for production:**

Run the following command in your terminal:

```plaintext
python manage.py collectstatic
```

This will copy all static files to the `STATIC_ROOT` directory.

## Models & Databases

### How do you define a model in Django? Provide an example.

You define a model in Django by creating a Python class that inherits from `django.db.models.Model`. Each attribute of the class represents a database field.

**Example:**

```plaintext
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    publication_date = models.DateField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    is_available = models.BooleanField(default=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

In this example:

- `Book` is the model class (and will be the table name in the database, typically `appname_book`).
- `title`, `author`, `publication_date`, `price`, and `is_available` are the fields of the model.
- `models.CharField`, `models.DateField`, `models.DecimalField`, and `models.BooleanField` are different types of field classes.
- `__str__` is a method that returns a human-readable representation of the object (used in the admin interface).

### What are different types of model fields in Django?

Django provides a wide range of model field types, including:

- **CharField:** For storing strings of a limited length.
- **TextField:** For storing large amounts of text.
- **IntegerField:** For storing integer numbers.
- **FloatField:** For storing floating-point numbers.
- **DecimalField:** For storing decimal numbers with fixed precision.
- **BooleanField:** For storing boolean values (True or False).
- **DateField:** For storing dates.
- **DateTimeField:** For storing dates and times.
- **TimeField:** For storing times.
- **EmailField:** For storing email addresses.
- **URLField:** For storing URLs.
- **FileField:** For storing files.
- **ImageField:** For storing images.
- **ForeignKey:** For defining one-to-many relationships.
- **ManyToManyField:** For defining many-to-many relationships.
- **OneToOneField:** For defining one-to-one relationships.

### How do you perform database migrations in Django?

Database migrations are used to synchronize your database schema with your Django models. The process involves two steps:

1.  **`makemigrations`**: This command detects changes in your models and creates new migration files. Run this command whenever you modify your models.

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

    You can specify a particular app:

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py makemigrations myapp
    ```

2.  **`migrate`**: This command applies the pending migrations to your database, updating the schema.

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

    You can specify a particular app:

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py migrate myapp
    ```

    You can also migrate to a specific migration:

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py migrate myapp 0001_initial
    ```

### How do you query the database using Django's ORM?

Django's ORM provides a convenient way to interact with the database using Python code. Here are some common query examples:

- **Retrieve all objects:**

  ```plaintext
  books = Book.objects.all()
  ```

- **Retrieve a single object by primary key:**

  ```plaintext
  book = Book.objects.get(pk=1)  # Raises Book.DoesNotExist if not found
  book = Book.objects.filter(pk=1).first() #Returns None if not found
  ```

- **Filter objects based on a condition:**

  ```plaintext
  books = Book.objects.filter(author='Jane Doe')
  books = Book.objects.filter(publication_date__year=2023)  # Field lookups (e.g., __year)
  ```

- **Exclude objects based on a condition:**

  ```plaintext
  books = Book.objects.exclude(is_available=False)
  ```

- **Order objects:**

  ```plaintext
  books = Book.objects.order_by('title')  # Ascending order
  books = Book.objects.order_by('-publication_date')  # Descending order
  ```

- **Chaining filters:**

  ```plaintext
  books = Book.objects.filter(author='Jane Doe').filter(price__gt=20)
  ```

- **Q objects for complex lookups (using OR and AND):**

  ```plaintext
  from django.db.models import Q

  books = Book.objects.filter(Q(author='Jane Doe') | Q(price__lt=15)) # Author is Jane Doe OR price is less than 15
  books = Book.objects.filter(Q(author='Jane Doe') & Q(is_available=True)) # Author is Jane Doe AND book is available
  ```

### What are Django QuerySets?

A QuerySet in Django represents a collection of objects from your database. It's lazily evaluated, meaning that the database query is not executed until you actually need the results (e.g., when you iterate over the QuerySet or call a method that requires the data).

QuerySets are chainable, allowing you to build complex queries by combining multiple filters, ordering, and other operations.

### Explain `select_related` and `prefetch_related` in Django.

`select_related` and `prefetch_related` are used to optimize database queries when dealing with related objects. They help reduce the number of database queries required to fetch related data, improving performance.

- **`select_related`**: Used for one-to-one and foreign key relationships. It performs a JOIN operation to fetch the related object in the same query as the main object. This avoids separate database queries for each related object (the "N+1" problem).

  ```plaintext
  # Suppose a Book model has a ForeignKey to an Author model
  books = Book.objects.select_related('author').all()  # Fetches books and their authors in a single query

  for book in books:
      print(book.author.name) # No extra database queries here!
  ```

- **`prefetch_related`**: Used for many-to-many and reverse foreign key relationships. It performs a separate query for each related object type and then caches the results. When you access the related objects, Django uses the cached data instead of making additional database queries.

  ```plaintext
  # Suppose a Book model has a ManyToManyField to a Genre model
  books = Book.objects.prefetch_related('genre_set').all() # Fetches books and their genres in separate queries, but caches the results

  for book in books:
      for genre in book.genre_set.all(): # No extra database queries for each book's genres!
          print(genre.name)
  ```

The key difference is that `select_related` uses a JOIN, while `prefetch_related` uses separate queries and caching. Choose the appropriate method based on the type of relationship and the complexity of the query.

### How do you use raw SQL queries in Django?

While Django's ORM is powerful, you might need to use raw SQL queries for complex or performance-critical tasks. Django provides several ways to execute raw SQL:

1.  **`RawSQL`**: Use `RawSQL` within a QuerySet filter to include raw SQL in the WHERE clause.

    ```plaintext
    from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL

    books = Book.objects.filter(RawSQL("lower(title) LIKE %s", ['%django%']))
    ```

2.  **`connection.cursor()`**: Use the `connection.cursor()` method to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This gives you the most flexibility but requires you to handle database connections and data mapping manually.

    ```plaintext
    from django.db import connection

    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM myapp_book WHERE price > %s", [20])
        results = cursor.fetchall()

    for row in results:
        print(row)
    ```

3.  **`Manager.raw()`**: Use `Manager.raw()` to execute raw SQL queries and map the results to model instances.

    ```plaintext
    books = Book.objects.raw("SELECT * FROM myapp_book WHERE author = %s", ['Jane Doe'])

    for book in books:
        print(book.title)
    ```

**Important:** When using raw SQL queries, be extremely careful to sanitize your inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks. Use parameterized queries whenever possible.

## Views & Templates

### What are the different types of views in Django?

Django supports two main types of views:

- **Function-Based Views (FBVs):** Simple Python functions that take a request object as input and return a response object.

- **Class-Based Views (CBVs):** Python classes that inherit from Django's view classes. They provide a more structured and reusable way to handle requests. CBVs are particularly useful for handling different HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in a single view.

### How do you create a function-based view?

A function-based view is a Python function that takes a request object as an argument and returns an HTTP response.

**Example:**

```plaintext
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'book_list.html', {'books': books})

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
```

In this example:

- `book_list` is a function-based view that retrieves all books from the database and renders the `book_list.html` template with the book data.
- `hello_world` returns a simple HTTP response with the text "Hello, world!".

### How do you create a class-based view?

A class-based view is a Python class that inherits from Django's generic view classes.

**Example:**

```plaintext
from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView

class BookListView(ListView):
    model = Book
    template_name = 'book_list.html'
    context_object_name = 'books'  # The variable name to use in the template

class BookDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Book
    template_name = 'book_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'book'
```

In this example:

- `BookListView` is a class-based view that inherits from `ListView`. It automatically retrieves all books from the database and renders the `book_list.html` template.
- `BookDetailView` is a class-based view that inherits from `DetailView`. It automatically retrieves a single book from the database based on the primary key in the URL and renders the `book_detail.html` template.

**Advantages of Class-Based Views:**

- **Reusability:** CBVs promote code reuse through inheritance.
- **Organization:** CBVs offer better organization, especially when handling multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Mixin Support:** CBVs can be easily extended using mixins to add common functionality.

### What are Django template tags and filters?

Django template tags and filters are used to add dynamic content and logic to your templates.

- **Template Tags:** Provide logic and control flow within your templates. They are enclosed in `{% ... %}`. Common tags include `{% if %}`, `{% for %}`, `{% block %}`, `{% extends %}`, `{% include %}`, `{% load %}`, etc.

- **Template Filters:** Modify the output of variables. They are applied using the pipe symbol `|`. Common filters include `{{ value|lower }}`, `{{ value|upper }}`, `{{ value|date:"F j, Y" }}`, `{{ value|truncatewords:30 }}`, etc.

**Example:**

```plaintext
{% if books %}
<ul>
  {% for book in books %}
  <li>
    {{ book.title|upper }} - {{ book.author }} (Published: {{ book.publication_date|date:"F j, Y"
    }})
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% else %}
<p>No books found.</p>
{% endif %}
```

You can also create custom template tags and filters to extend Django's template language.

### How do you use template inheritance in Django?

Template inheritance allows you to create a base template that defines the common structure and layout of your website and then extend it in other templates to add specific content.

1.  **Create a base template (e.g., `base.html`):**

    ```plaintext
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{% block title %}My Website{% endblock %}</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/books/">Books</a></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <main>
          {% block content %}
          <!-- Default content -->
          {% endblock %}
        </main>

        <footer>
          <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
        </footer>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

2.  **Extend the base template in other templates (e.g., `book_list.html`):**

    ```plaintext
    {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block title %}Book List{% endblock %} {% block content %}
    <h1>Book List</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for book in books %}
      <li>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endblock %}
    ```

In this example:

- `{% extends 'base.html' %}` tells the `book_list.html` template to inherit from `base.html`.
- `{% block title %}` and `{% block content %}` define blocks that can be overridden in the child template.
- The content within the `{% block content %}` tags in `book_list.html` will replace the corresponding block in `base.html`.

Template inheritance promotes code reuse and maintainability by separating the common layout from the specific content of each page.

### How do you handle forms in Django?

Django provides a powerful form handling system that simplifies the process of creating, processing, and validating HTML forms.

1.  **Define a form class:**

    ```plaintext
    from django import forms

    class BookForm(forms.Form):
        title = forms.CharField(max_length=200, label='Title')
        author = forms.CharField(max_length=100, label='Author')
        publication_date = forms.DateField(label='Publication Date')
        price = forms.DecimalField(label='Price')
    ```

2.  **Create a view to handle the form:**

    ```plaintext
    from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

    def create_book(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            form = BookForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                # Process the form data
                title = form.cleaned_data['title']
                author = form.cleaned_data['author']
                publication_date = form.cleaned_data['publication_date']
                price = form.cleaned_data['price']

                Book.objects.create(title=title, author=author, publication_date=publication_date, price=price)
                return redirect('book_list')  # Redirect to the book list view
        else:
            form = BookForm()
        return render(request, 'create_book.html', {'form': form})
    ```

3.  **Render the form in a template (e.g., `create_book.html`):**

    ```plaintext
    <form method="post">
      {% csrf_token %}
      <!-- Add CSRF token for security -->
      {{ form.as_p }}
      <!-- Render the form as paragraphs -->
      <button type="submit">Create Book</button>
    </form>
    ```

In this example:

- `BookForm` is a form class that defines the fields of the form.
- The `create_book` view handles the form submission. If the form is valid, it processes the data and creates a new `Book` object.
- The `form.as_p` template tag renders the form as a set of paragraphs.

Django's form handling system also provides built-in validation, data cleaning, and error handling.

### What are Django's built-in form fields?

Django provides a variety of built-in form fields for different types of data:

- **CharField:** For text input.
- **TextField:** For large text input (textarea).
- **IntegerField:** For integer numbers.
- **FloatField:** For floating-point numbers.
- **DecimalField:** For decimal numbers.
- **BooleanField:** For boolean values (checkbox).
- **DateField:** For dates.
- **DateTimeField:** For dates and times.
- **TimeField:** For times.
- **EmailField:** For email addresses.
- **URLField:** For URLs.
- **FileField:** For file uploads.
- **ImageField:** For image uploads.
- **ChoiceField:** For selecting from a list of choices (select dropdown).
- **MultipleChoiceField:** For selecting multiple choices from a list (select multiple).
- **ModelChoiceField:** For selecting a model instance from a queryset (select dropdown).
- **ModelMultipleChoiceField:** For selecting multiple model instances from a queryset (select multiple).

Each form field has various options for customization, such as `max_length`, `required`, `label`, `help_text`, and `widget`.

## URLs & Routing

### How do you define URLs in Django?

URLs in Django are defined in the `urls.py` files of your project and apps. You use the `path()` or `re_path()` functions to map URLs to specific views.

**Example in `urls.py` (project level):**

```plaintext
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('books/', include('books.urls')),  # Include the URLs from the books app
]
```

**Example in `urls.py` (app level, e.g., `books/urls.py`):**

```plaintext
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.book_list, name='book_list'),  # URL for the book list view
    path('<int:pk>/', views.book_detail, name='book_detail'),  # URL for the book detail view (with a primary key parameter)
]
```

In these examples:

- `path()` defines a URL pattern that matches the given string.
- The first argument to `path()` is the URL pattern.
- The second argument is the view function or class that should handle the request.
- The `name` argument assigns a name to the URL pattern, which can be used to generate URLs dynamically in templates and views.
- `include()` includes the URLs from another `urls.py` file.

### What are URL patterns and regular expressions in Django URLs?

URL patterns are used to match URLs to specific views. Django provides two functions for defining URL patterns:

- **`path()`**: Uses a simple syntax for defining URL patterns with type converters.

  ```plaintext
  path('articles/<int:year>/<slug:title>/', views.article_detail, name='article_detail')
  ```

  In this example:

  - `<int:year>` matches an integer and passes it to the view as the `year` argument.
  - `<slug:title>` matches a slug (a string of letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores) and passes it to the view as the `title` argument.

- **`re_path()`**: Uses regular expressions for more complex URL matching.

  ```plaintext
  from django.urls import re_path

  re_path(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<title>[\w-]+)/$', views.article_detail, name='article_detail')
  ```

  In this example:

  - `r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<title>[\w-]+)/$'` is a regular expression that matches URLs like `/articles/2023/my-article/`.
  - `(?P<year>[0-9]{4})` captures a 4-digit year and passes it to the view as the `year` argument.
  - `(?P<title>[\w-]+)` captures a slug and passes it to the view as the `title` argument.

Regular expressions provide more flexibility for defining complex URL patterns, but `path()` is often simpler to use for basic cases.

### How do you use named URL patterns in Django?

Named URL patterns allow you to refer to URLs by their names instead of hardcoding the URL strings. This makes your code more maintainable and easier to update if the URLs change.

1.  **Define the URL pattern with a `name` argument in `urls.py`:**

    ```plaintext

    ```
