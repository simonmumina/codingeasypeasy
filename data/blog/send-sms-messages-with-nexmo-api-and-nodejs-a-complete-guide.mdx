# Send SMS Messages with Nexmo API and Node.js: A Complete Guide

In today's world, SMS messaging remains a powerful and reliable communication channel. Whether you're building a two-factor authentication system, sending appointment reminders, or delivering marketing messages, integrating SMS functionality into your Node.js applications is crucial. This tutorial will guide you through using the Nexmo API (now known as Vonage API) to send SMS messages with Node.js. We'll cover everything from setting up your account to writing the code that sends the messages.

## What is the Vonage API (formerly Nexmo)?

The Vonage API (previously known as Nexmo) is a cloud communication platform that provides APIs for voice, messaging, and video. It allows developers to easily integrate communication features into their applications without the need for complex infrastructure. Their SMS API is particularly popular for its reliability, global reach, and ease of use.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed and set up:

- **Node.js and npm:** You'll need Node.js and its package manager, npm, installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **A Vonage API Account:** You'll need a Vonage API account. Sign up for a free account at [https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/sms/](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/sms/). You'll receive API key and secret, which are essential for authenticating your requests.
- **A Vonage Phone Number:** Within your Vonage account, you'll need to purchase a phone number. This number will be used as the sender ID for your SMS messages. This usually costs a small monthly fee.

## Setting up Your Node.js Project

1.  **Create a New Project Directory:**

    ```plaintext
    mkdir nexmo-sms-demo
    cd nexmo-sms-demo
    ```

2.  **Initialize a New Node.js Project:**

    ```plaintext
    npm init -y
    ```

3.  **Install the Vonage Node.js Library:**
    ```plaintext
    npm install @vonage/server-sdk
    ```

## Writing the Code

Now let's write the code to send SMS messages. Create a file named `send-sms.js` (or any name you prefer) and add the following code:

```plaintext
// send-sms.js
const Vonage = require('@vonage/server-sdk')

// Replace with your API key and secret from your Vonage account
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
const apiSecret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'

// Replace with your Vonage phone number and the recipient's phone number
const fromNumber = 'YOUR_VONAGE_NUMBER' //E.g. 447700900000 - Include country code
const toNumber = 'RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER' //E.g. 447700900000 - Include country code
const text = 'Hello from Nexmo (Vonage) and Node.js!'

const vonage = new Vonage({
  apiKey: apiKey,
  apiSecret: apiSecret,
})

vonage.message.sendSms(fromNumber, toNumber, text, (err, responseData) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    if (responseData.messages[0]['status'] === '0') {
      console.log('Message sent successfully.')
    } else {
      console.log(`Message failed with error: ${responseData.messages[0]['error-text']}`)
    }
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`require('@vonage/server-sdk')`:** Imports the Vonage Node.js library.
- **`apiKey` and `apiSecret`:** Replace these placeholders with your actual API key and secret from your Vonage account dashboard. **Important:** Never commit these credentials directly to your version control system. Use environment variables (explained later) instead.
- **`fromNumber`:** Replace this with the Vonage phone number you purchased. **Important:** Include the country code.
- **`toNumber`:** Replace this with the recipient's phone number. **Important:** Include the country code.
- **`text`:** The message you want to send.
- **`vonage.message.sendSms(...)`:** This function sends the SMS message. It takes the sender number, recipient number, message text, and a callback function as arguments.
- **Callback Function:** The callback function handles the response from the Vonage API. It checks for errors and logs the success or failure of the message sending.

## Running the Code

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the `send-sms.js` file with your actual API key, secret, Vonage phone number, and recipient phone number.

2.  **Run the Script:**
    ```plaintext
    node send-sms.js
    ```

If everything is set up correctly, you should receive an SMS message on the recipient phone number. The console will also print a success or error message.

## Using Environment Variables (Recommended)

Hardcoding your API key and secret directly into your code is a security risk. It's best practice to store them as environment variables.

1.  **Install `dotenv`:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install dotenv
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file:** In the root of your project, create a file named `.env` and add your API key and secret:

    ```
    VONAGE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    VONAGE_API_SECRET=YOUR_API_SECRET
    VONAGE_FROM_NUMBER=YOUR_VONAGE_NUMBER
    VONAGE_TO_NUMBER=RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER
    VONAGE_MESSAGE_TEXT='Hello from Env Vars'
    ```

    **Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your secrets to your repository.

3.  **Modify your `send-sms.js` file:**

```plaintext
// send-sms.js
require('dotenv').config() // Load environment variables from .env

const Vonage = require('@vonage/server-sdk')

const apiKey = process.env.VONAGE_API_KEY
const apiSecret = process.env.VONAGE_API_SECRET
const fromNumber = process.env.VONAGE_FROM_NUMBER
const toNumber = process.env.VONAGE_TO_NUMBER
const text = process.env.VONAGE_MESSAGE_TEXT

const vonage = new Vonage({
  apiKey: apiKey,
  apiSecret: apiSecret,
})

vonage.message.sendSms(fromNumber, toNumber, text, (err, responseData) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err)
  } else {
    if (responseData.messages[0]['status'] === '0') {
      console.log('Message sent successfully.')
    } else {
      console.log(`Message failed with error: ${responseData.messages[0]['error-text']}`)
    }
  }
})
```

Now the script reads the API key and secret from the environment variables. You can run the script again using `node send-sms.js`.

## Handling Errors

The example code includes basic error handling, but you should implement more robust error handling in your production applications. This includes:

- **Checking the `status` code in the response:** The `status` code indicates whether the message was successfully sent. Refer to the Vonage API documentation for a list of possible status codes and their meanings.
- **Implementing retry logic:** If a message fails to send due to a temporary error, you might want to retry sending the message after a short delay.
- **Logging errors:** Log errors to a file or a monitoring service for debugging and analysis.

## Advanced Features

The Vonage API offers many other features beyond basic SMS sending, including:

- **Two-way SMS:** Receive and respond to SMS messages.
- **Unicode Support:** Send messages in different languages.
- **Long SMS:** Send messages longer than 160 characters (concatenated SMS).
- **SMS Marketing:** Use the API for bulk SMS marketing campaigns.
- **Number Insight:** Validate and enrich phone numbers.

Refer to the Vonage API documentation for more information on these features: [https://developer.vonage.com/](https://developer.vonage.com/)

## Alternatives to Vonage API

While Vonage is a popular choice, other SMS API providers are available. Some popular alternatives include:

- **Twilio:** A very well known and widely used platform with a comprehensive set of communication APIs.
- **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service):** Amazon's service offers SMS capabilities as part of its broader notification service. Good if you are already heavily invested in the AWS ecosystem.
- **MessageBird:** Another popular platform offering global SMS and messaging solutions.

The choice of provider depends on your specific needs, budget, and technical requirements.
