# Yarn Set Version from Sources: A Comprehensive Guide for Developers

Yarn, a popular JavaScript package manager, offers various ways to manage dependencies and versions within your projects. While using official release versions through `yarn set version` and the `npm` registry is common, there are situations where you might need more control. This could involve using an unreleased version from the Yarn repository, testing custom changes, or contributing to Yarn's development. This guide explores how to `yarn set version` from sources, empowering you to use custom or development versions of Yarn.

## Why Set Yarn Version from Sources?

Setting the Yarn version from sources provides several advantages:

- **Access to Unreleased Features:** Get a sneak peek and experiment with upcoming features and bug fixes before they're officially released.
- **Customization and Contribution:** Test your own modifications and contributions to the Yarn project. This is crucial for developers actively involved in Yarn's development.
- **Debugging:** Debug specific issues by using a specific commit or branch, making it easier to pinpoint the source of a problem.
- **Bleeding Edge Adoption:** For advanced users comfortable with potential instability, use the latest, potentially unstable, changes directly from the Yarn repository.
- **Circumventing Registry Issues:** In rare scenarios where accessing the npm registry is problematic or impossible, building from source offers a viable alternative.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Yarn requires Node.js. Install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version or a more recent version if your project requires it. You can download it from the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)).
- **Git:** Git is essential for cloning the Yarn repository. You can download it from the official Git website ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)).
- **Yarn (existing version):** You'll need an existing Yarn installation (version 2 or higher) to bootstrap the process. If you don't have one, install it globally using npm:

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

## Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Yarn Version from Sources

Here's a detailed breakdown of how to set the Yarn version from source code:

**1. Clone the Yarn Repository:**

The first step is to clone the official Yarn repository from GitHub. This will download the entire Yarn source code to your local machine.

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry.git yarn-source
cd yarn-source
```

This command clones the repository into a directory named `yarn-source`. You can choose any name you prefer.

**2. Checkout a Specific Branch, Tag, or Commit (Optional):**

By default, you'll be on the `trunk` branch (formerly `master`). This branch contains the latest, potentially unstable, changes. If you want to use a specific version, checkout a tag corresponding to a released version or a specific commit.

- **Checkout a Tag (Release Version):**

  To checkout a specific release version, use the following command, replacing `<tag_name>` with the desired tag. For example, to checkout version 4.1.0:

  ```plaintext
  git checkout 4.1.0
  ```

- **Checkout a Specific Commit:**

  To checkout a specific commit, use the following command, replacing `<commit_hash>` with the desired commit hash:

  ```plaintext
  git checkout <commit_hash>
  ```

  You can find commit hashes on the Yarn GitHub repository ([https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)).

- **Checkout a Development Branch (e.g., `next`):**

  To checkout a development branch (like `next`), use:

  ```plaintext
  git checkout next
  ```

  Be aware that development branches are likely unstable.

**3. Build Yarn from Source:**

Once you've checked out the desired version or branch, you need to build Yarn from the source code. The Yarn repository includes a `Makefile` for this purpose.

```plaintext
yarn
yarn version set base # This is a crucial step!
yarn build:tsc
```

Let's break down these commands:

- `yarn`: This command uses your _existing_ Yarn installation to install the dependencies required to build Yarn itself. This uses the version of yarn that is installed globally, or in the current project if you have a yarn version already set locally.

- `yarn version set base`: This command is incredibly important. It tells Yarn to use the current directory (`yarn-source`) as the base directory for resolving dependencies. This ensures that the built Yarn version can find its own dependencies within the source code. Failing to do this will most likely cause errors later on.

- `yarn build:tsc`: This command compiles the TypeScript source code into JavaScript. This may take a few minutes depending on your system. The other build commands can work as well, but `yarn build:tsc` is often the simplest and fastest to get up and running.

**4. Set the Yarn Version in Your Project:**

Now that you've built Yarn from source, you can use it in your projects. Navigate to your project directory.

```plaintext
cd your-project
```

Then, use the `yarn set version` command, pointing it to the built Yarn distribution in the `yarn-source` directory. The path depends on the build command you used. For `yarn build:tsc`, the path will be `yarn-source/packages/yarnpkg-cli/bin/yarn.js`.

```plaintext
yarn set version /path/to/yarn-source/packages/yarnpkg-cli/bin/yarn.js
```

Replace `/path/to/yarn-source` with the actual path to the `yarn-source` directory on your machine.

**Example:**

If you cloned the repository to `/Users/yourusername/development/yarn-source` then the command would be:

```plaintext
yarn set version /Users/yourusername/development/yarn-source/packages/yarnpkg-cli/bin/yarn.js
```

**5. Verify the Yarn Version:**

Verify that the correct Yarn version is being used by running:

```plaintext
yarn --version
```

The output should reflect the version you checked out or built from source. If you checked out a specific tag, it will display that version. If you are using a commit or trunk, it may output a version based on the closest tag.

## Example Scenario: Testing a Bug Fix Before Release

Let's say you've identified a bug in Yarn and found a pull request on GitHub that fixes it. You want to test the fix in your project before it's officially released. Here's how you would use the steps above:

1.  **Clone the Yarn repository:**

    ```plaintext
    git clone https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry.git yarn-source
    cd yarn-source
    ```

2.  **Checkout the Pull Request's Branch (or Create a Branch from the Commit):**
    Let's assume the pull request is against a branch named `fix/my-bug`.

    ```plaintext
    git checkout fix/my-bug
    ```

    If the fix is only available as a commit, create a new branch:

    ```plaintext
    git checkout -b fix/my-bug <commit_hash>
    ```

3.  **Build Yarn from Source:**

    ```plaintext
    yarn
    yarn version set base
    yarn build:tsc
    ```

4.  **Set the Yarn Version in Your Project:**

    ```plaintext
    cd your-project
    yarn set version /path/to/yarn-source/packages/yarnpkg-cli/bin/yarn.js
    ```

5.  **Test the Fix:** Run the commands that previously exhibited the bug to ensure it has been resolved.

## Important Considerations

- **Path Specificity:** The path you provide to `yarn set version` must be an absolute path.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read and execute the `yarn.js` file.
- **Stability:** Using development branches or specific commits can lead to instability. Be prepared for potential issues and regressions.
- **Updates:** When using a development version, you'll need to rebuild and update your project's Yarn version whenever you want to incorporate new changes from the Yarn repository. This involves repeating steps 3 and 4.
- **.yarnrc.yml:** The `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project's root directory will be modified to reflect the new Yarn version. Be sure to commit this file to your repository to ensure that other developers working on the project use the same Yarn version.
- **`yarn install` after changing versions:** After running `yarn set version`, it's generally a good practice to run `yarn install` to ensure that your dependencies are compatible with the new Yarn version.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Error: Invalid Yarn version: ...`:** This usually indicates that the path you provided to `yarn set version` is incorrect or that the specified file is not a valid Yarn distribution. Double-check the path and ensure that the `yarn.js` file exists. Also ensure the build process completed successfully.
- **`Error: Cannot find module '...'`:** This often occurs if you forgot to run `yarn version set base` after cloning the Yarn repository. This command is essential for setting up the correct environment for Yarn to resolve its dependencies.
- **`Yarn commands not working as expected`:** Make sure you've run `yarn install` after switching yarn versions. Also ensure that the correct version of yarn is being used by checking `yarn --version`
- **Stuck in a broken state:** If things get really messed up, try running `yarn set version latest` to revert back to the latest stable release.

## Conclusion

Setting the Yarn version from sources provides developers with unparalleled control over their package manager. Whether you're testing new features, contributing to Yarn's development, or debugging specific issues, this technique empowers you to leverage the full potential of Yarn in your projects. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can confidently use custom or development versions of Yarn, unlocking a new level of flexibility and control over your development workflow. Remember to carefully consider the potential risks associated with using unstable versions and to update your project's Yarn version regularly to incorporate the latest changes.
