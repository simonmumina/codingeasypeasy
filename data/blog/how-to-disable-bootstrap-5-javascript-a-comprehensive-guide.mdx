# How to Disable Bootstrap 5 JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

Bootstrap 5 is a powerful CSS framework that provides a lot of pre-built components and styles, making web development faster and easier. However, sometimes you might want to use only the CSS part of Bootstrap and disable its JavaScript functionality. This can be beneficial for several reasons, including:

- **Improved Performance:** JavaScript adds to the page load time. If you're not using Bootstrap's JavaScript components (e.g., modals, carousels, dropdowns), disabling it can significantly reduce your website's initial load time and improve its overall performance.
- **Reduced Complexity:** By removing the JavaScript dependency, you simplify your project and reduce the potential for conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.
- **Greater Control:** You might prefer to implement interactive elements using other JavaScript libraries like React, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript. Disabling Bootstrap's JavaScript gives you full control over your website's interactivity.
- **CSS-Only Projects:** Sometimes you only need the grid system, typography, and styling provided by Bootstrap's CSS, making the JavaScript component unnecessary.

This guide will walk you through the different methods for disabling Bootstrap 5's JavaScript, providing clear instructions and code examples.

## Methods for Disabling Bootstrap 5 JavaScript

There are several ways to disable Bootstrap 5 JavaScript, depending on how you're including Bootstrap in your project:

### 1. Removing the JavaScript Import/Include

This is the most straightforward method. If you're linking to Bootstrap's JavaScript file directly in your HTML, simply remove the `<script>` tag.

**Example:**

**Before (JavaScript Enabled):**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Bootstrap!</h1>

    <!--  Bootstrap JavaScript Bundle with Popper (enabled) -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**After (JavaScript Disabled):**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Bootstrap!</h1>

    <!-- Bootstrap JavaScript Bundle with Popper (disabled) -->
    <!-- <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> -->
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, we've simply commented out (or removed) the line that includes the Bootstrap JavaScript bundle. This prevents the JavaScript from loading and executing.

### 2. Using a CSS Only Distribution (If Available)

Sometimes distributions offer a CSS only version. Look for downloads that specifically mention "CSS only" or exclude the JavaScript files. Using such distributions avoids downloading javascript files in the first place.

### 3. Bundling with a Module Bundler (Webpack, Parcel, Rollup, etc.)

If you're using a module bundler like Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup, you can selectively import only the CSS part of Bootstrap. This usually involves avoiding importing the JavaScript module.

**Example (Webpack):**

1.  **Install Bootstrap (if you haven't already):**

    ```plaintext
    npm install bootstrap
    ```

2.  **Import Bootstrap CSS in your main JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`):**

    ```plaintext
    // index.js
    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

    // Do NOT import the JavaScript!  This disables Bootstrap's JS functionality
    // import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js'; // Wrong - this will load the JS
    // or
    // import 'bootstrap'; // This will load both CSS and JS which is not desirable.
    ```

3.  **Configure Webpack:** Ensure your webpack configuration is correctly set up to handle CSS imports. This often involves using `css-loader` and `style-loader`.

```plaintext
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
      // Add other rules as needed (e.g., for Babel, images, etc.)
    ],
  },
}
```

In this Webpack example, we specifically import the CSS file from Bootstrap's `dist` directory. By **not** importing the JavaScript file, we effectively disable its functionality.

### 4. Using a Custom Build (Sass/SCSS)

If you're using Sass/SCSS for styling, you can import Bootstrap's Sass files and only include the components you need. This allows you to exclude JavaScript-dependent components from your build.

**Example:**

1.  **Install Bootstrap as a dependency:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install bootstrap
    ```

2.  **Create a custom SCSS file (e.g., `custom.scss`):**

    ```plaintext
    // custom.scss

    // 1. Import Bootstrap functions and variables
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/functions';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/variables';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/mixins';

    // 2. Override default variables (optional) - customize colors, fonts etc.

    // 3. Import Bootstrap components you need (excluding JS-dependent ones)
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/root';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/reboot';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/type';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/images';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/grid';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/tables';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/buttons';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/forms';
    @import 'bootstrap/scss/utilities';

    // 4.  Add your own custom styles
    ```

    **Important:** Carefully select which Bootstrap components to import. Exclude components that rely heavily on JavaScript, such as:

    - `@import "bootstrap/scss/carousel";`
    - `@import "bootstrap/scss/dropdown";`
    - `@import "bootstrap/scss/modal";`
    - `@import "bootstrap/scss/collapse";`
    - `@import "bootstrap/scss/offcanvas";`

3.  **Compile the SCSS file:** Use a Sass compiler (e.g., `node-sass`, `dart-sass`) to compile your `custom.scss` file into a CSS file.

    ```plaintext
    sass custom.scss custom.css
    ```

4.  **Include the compiled CSS file in your HTML:**

    ```plaintext
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="custom.css" />
        <!-- Link to your compiled CSS -->
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, Bootstrap!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

This method provides the most granular control, allowing you to cherry-pick the CSS styles you need while avoiding the JavaScript altogether. Remember to avoid importing components that require javascript functionality.

## Important Considerations

- **Dependencies:** Be aware that some Bootstrap components, like tooltips and popovers, _require_ Popper.js for proper positioning. If you disable Bootstrap's JavaScript, these components will not function correctly unless you provide an alternative solution for positioning.

- **Accessibility:** When disabling JavaScript, carefully consider the accessibility implications. Ensure that your website remains accessible to users who have JavaScript disabled or rely on assistive technologies. For example, provide alternative ways to access content that would normally be displayed in a modal. Using appropriate ARIA attributes can help.

- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your website after disabling Bootstrap's JavaScript to ensure that everything is working as expected and that no functionality is broken. Pay particular attention to components that might have previously relied on Bootstrap's JavaScript for interactivity.

## When Should You Disable Bootstrap JavaScript?

Consider disabling Bootstrap's JavaScript when:

- You're primarily using Bootstrap for its CSS grid system and styling.
- You're using a different JavaScript framework (like React, Vue, or Angular) to handle interactivity.
- You want to optimize your website's performance and reduce its initial load time.
- You need a high level of customization and control over your website's JavaScript behavior.
- You want to minimize dependencies and reduce the complexity of your project.

## Conclusion

Disabling Bootstrap 5 JavaScript can be a valuable optimization technique for improving website performance and gaining greater control over your project. By carefully choosing the appropriate method and considering the potential implications, you can leverage the power of Bootstrap's CSS while avoiding the overhead of its JavaScript. Remember to always test your website thoroughly after disabling JavaScript to ensure that everything is functioning as expected and that accessibility is maintained. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can confidently disable Bootstrap 5 JavaScript and tailor your project to meet your specific needs.
