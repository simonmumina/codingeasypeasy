# Keep Your Node.js App Running 24/7: A Comprehensive Guide to Permanent Deployment

Deploying a Node.js application is only half the battle. Ensuring it stays running, even after crashes, reboots, or unexpected errors, is critical for a production-ready environment. This guide explores various methods to run your Node.js application permanently, covering popular process managers and system-level services. We'll cover PM2, Forever.js, and systemd, providing code examples and best practices along the way.

## Why Run Your Node.js App Permanently?

Imagine your e-commerce site going down in the middle of Black Friday due to a simple uncaught exception. The consequences can be devastating. Running your Node.js application permanently addresses several critical issues:

- **High Availability:** Ensures your application is always accessible to users.
- **Automatic Restarts:** Automatically restarts the application if it crashes.
- **Reduced Downtime:** Minimizes downtime due to errors or server reboots.
- **Simplified Management:** Streamlines application monitoring and management.
- **Improved Reliability:** Increases the overall reliability and stability of your application.

## Method 1: Using PM2 (Production Process Manager)

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It offers features like automatic restarts, monitoring, and cluster mode for improved performance. PM2 is the most widely recommended solution for most node.js deployments.

### Installation

First, install PM2 globally using npm:

```plaintext
npm install -g pm2
```

### Running Your Application with PM2

Navigate to your application's root directory in your terminal. Then, use the following command to start your application with PM2:

```plaintext
pm2 start app.js --name "my-node-app"
```

- `app.js`: Replace this with the entry point of your Node.js application.
- `--name "my-node-app"`: Assigns a name to your application for easier management.

### Key PM2 Commands

Here are some essential PM2 commands:

- **`pm2 list`:** Lists all running PM2 processes.
- **`pm2 stop <app_name>`:** Stops a specific application. Example: `pm2 stop my-node-app`
- **`pm2 restart <app_name>`:** Restarts a specific application. Example: `pm2 restart my-node-app`
- **`pm2 delete <app_name>`:** Deletes an application from PM2's process list. Example: `pm2 delete my-node-app`
- **`pm2 logs <app_name>`:** Displays the logs for a specific application. Example: `pm2 logs my-node-app`
- **`pm2 monit`:** Provides a visual dashboard for monitoring your applications.
- **`pm2 reload <app_name>`:** Reloads your application without downtime, often used after code updates. Example: `pm2 reload my-node-app` (For zero-downtime deployments, you need to configure your app for clustering and use `pm2 reload`)

### Clustering for Improved Performance

PM2 supports clustering, which allows you to run multiple instances of your application to take advantage of multi-core processors.

```plaintext
pm2 start app.js -i max --name "my-node-app"
```

- `-i max`: Starts as many instances as there are CPU cores. You can also specify a specific number (e.g., `-i 4` to run four instances).

### Startup Script for Automatic Restart on Reboot

To ensure your application restarts automatically after a server reboot, create a startup script:

```plaintext
pm2 startup systemd
```

This command will generate a command that you need to copy and run to create the systemd startup script. The generated command looks something like this:

```plaintext
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u <your_user> --hp /home/<your_user>
```

Replace `<your_user>` with your system's username.

After running the command, save the current process list for PM2 to restore it upon reboot:

```plaintext
pm2 save
```

### Example Configuration File (process.json or ecosystem.config.js)

For more complex configurations, you can use a configuration file. Here's an example `ecosystem.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'my-node-app',
      script: './app.js',
      instances: 'max', // Or a number like 4
      autorestart: true,
      watch: false, // Set to true for development, false for production
      max_memory_restart: '2G',
      env_production: {
        NODE_ENV: 'production',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

To start your application using the configuration file:

```plaintext
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

## Method 2: Using Forever.js (Simple Process Monitor)

[Forever.js](https://github.com/foreversd/forever) is a simpler alternative to PM2. It focuses primarily on keeping your Node.js application running.

### Installation

Install Forever.js globally using npm:

```plaintext
npm install -g forever
```

### Running Your Application with Forever.js

Start your application with Forever.js:

```plaintext
forever start app.js
```

### Key Forever.js Commands

- **`forever list`:** Lists all running Forever.js processes.
- **`forever stop <script>`:** Stops a specific application. Example: `forever stop app.js`
- **`forever restart <script>`:** Restarts a specific application. Example: `forever restart app.js`
- **`forever stopall`:** Stops all Forever.js processes.
- **`forever logs`:** Shows all Forever.js logs.
- **`forever monitor <script>`:** Starts a script as a daemon and monitors it, restarting if it crashes. Example: `forever monitor app.js`

### Configuration

Forever.js supports configuration files for more advanced options. You can create a `.foreverignore` file to exclude certain files from being monitored.

### Startup Script (Using rc.local or systemd)

To ensure Forever.js restarts your application on reboot, you'll need to create a startup script. Since `rc.local` is deprecated on many systems, systemd is the recommended approach. We'll cover the systemd approach later in this guide.

## Method 3: Using Systemd (Linux System and Service Manager)

[Systemd](https://systemd.io/) is a system and service manager commonly used on Linux systems. It provides a robust and reliable way to manage processes, including Node.js applications.

### Creating a Systemd Service File

Create a service file for your application. This file defines how systemd should manage your application. Typically, these files are located in `/etc/systemd/system/`. Create a file named `my-node-app.service` (replace `my-node-app` with your preferred name) with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=My Node.js Application
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_user  # Replace with your username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/app  # Replace with your application's directory
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node app.js  # Replace with your application's entry point and the correct path to node.
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
Environment=NODE_ENV=production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Explanation:**

- **`[Unit]`:** Defines the unit (service) and its dependencies. `After=network.target` ensures the service starts after the network is up.
- **`[Service]`:** Defines how the service should be executed.
  - `User`: The user under which the application will run. **Important: Use a non-root user for security reasons.**
  - `WorkingDirectory`: The directory where your application resides.
  - `ExecStart`: The command to start your application. Make sure the path to `node` is correct. You can find it by running `which node`.
  - `Restart`: Determines when to restart the service. `on-failure` restarts the service if it exits with a non-zero exit code.
  - `RestartSec`: The time (in seconds) to wait before attempting to restart the service.
  - `Environment`: Sets environment variables for the application. Here, we set `NODE_ENV` to `production`.
- **`[Install]`:** Defines how the service should be enabled. `WantedBy=multi-user.target` ensures the service starts when the system enters the multi-user state (normal operation).

**Important:** Remember to replace `your_user`, `/path/to/your/app`, and `app.js` with the correct values for your system and application.

### Enabling and Starting the Service

After creating the service file, enable and start the service:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl enable my-node-app.service
sudo systemctl start my-node-app.service
```

### Key Systemd Commands

- **`sudo systemctl status my-node-app.service`:** Checks the status of the service.
- **`sudo systemctl stop my-node-app.service`:** Stops the service.
- **`sudo systemctl start my-node-app.service`:** Starts the service.
- **`sudo systemctl restart my-node-app.service`:** Restarts the service.
- **`sudo systemctl disable my-node-app.service`:** Disables the service (prevents it from starting on boot).
- **`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`:** Reloads the systemd daemon after making changes to service files. **Crucial after modifying your .service file!**
- **`journalctl -u my-node-app.service`:** Views the logs for the service. This is extremely useful for debugging.

### Example Systemd Service File with Nginx Reverse Proxy

If you're using Nginx as a reverse proxy, your systemd service file might look like this. Assuming Nginx is configured to proxy requests to `localhost:3000`:

```
[Unit]
Description=My Node.js Application behind Nginx
After=network.target nginx.service

[Service]
User=your_user
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/app
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node app.js
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
# Optional: Bind the app to localhost only
Environment=PORT=3000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Key Changes:**

- `After=network.target nginx.service`: Ensures the service starts after the network and Nginx are up.
- `Environment=PORT=3000`: Sets the port your Node.js application listens on.
  It's highly recommended to listen on localhost only and use nginx as a reverse proxy, so that you are not exposing your node.js application directly to the internet.

## Choosing the Right Method

- **PM2:** Recommended for most Node.js applications due to its ease of use, features like cluster mode and monitoring, and active development. Ideal for production deployments.
- **Forever.js:** A simpler alternative for basic process monitoring. Suitable for simpler applications or development environments.
- **Systemd:** Provides a robust and system-level solution for managing Node.js applications. Requires a deeper understanding of system administration but offers the most control and integration with the operating system. Excellent for more complex server environments.

## Security Considerations

- **Run as a Non-Root User:** Never run your Node.js application as the root user. Create a dedicated user for your application to minimize the impact of potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update your application's dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Use a Firewall:** Configure a firewall (e.g., `ufw` on Ubuntu) to restrict access to your server.
- **Reverse Proxy (Nginx or Apache):** Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to handle incoming requests and forward them to your Node.js application. This adds a layer of security and allows you to handle SSL/TLS termination, load balancing, and other features.
- **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor your application logs for suspicious activity or errors.

## Conclusion

Running your Node.js application permanently is essential for production environments. By using tools like PM2, Forever.js, or systemd, you can ensure high availability, minimize downtime, and simplify application management. Choose the method that best suits your needs and environment, and always prioritize security best practices. Remember to test your deployment thoroughly before deploying to production. Good luck!
