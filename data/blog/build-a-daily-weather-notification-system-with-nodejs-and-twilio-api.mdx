# Build a Daily Weather Notification System with Node.js and Twilio API

Do you want to receive daily weather updates directly on your mobile phone? This guide will walk you through creating a system that automatically fetches weather data and sends it to you as an SMS using Node.js, a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap), and the Twilio API. No more checking weather apps – the forecast will come to you!

This tutorial is perfect for developers of all skill levels, and it will provide a solid foundation for building more complex notification systems.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:** You can download them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **A Twilio account:** Sign up for a free trial at [Twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/). You'll need your Account SID and Auth Token. You'll also need to purchase a Twilio phone number. (Free trial accounts have limitations.)
- **A Weather API Key:** Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) (or a similar weather API provider). Remember to choose a free plan if you are just experimenting. Make sure to familiarize yourself with their usage guidelines.

## Setting up the Project

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```plaintext
mkdir weather-notifications
cd weather-notifications
```

Then, initialize a new Node.js project:

```plaintext
npm init -y  # Or yarn init -y
```

Now, install the necessary packages:

```plaintext
npm install twilio node-fetch dotenv  # Or yarn add twilio node-fetch dotenv
```

- **twilio:** For interacting with the Twilio API to send SMS messages.
- **node-fetch:** For making HTTP requests to the weather API. (You can also use `axios` or the built-in `http` module.)
- **dotenv:** For loading environment variables from a `.env` file (to keep your API keys and Twilio credentials secure).

## Creating the `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your API keys and Twilio credentials. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890  # Your Twilio phone number
MY_PHONE_NUMBER=+11234567890 # Your personal phone number
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
CITY_ID=5128581 #City ID for New York for OpenWeatherMap (you can find yours on the OpenWeatherMap website)
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to a public repository. Add it to your `.gitignore` file:

```
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

## Writing the Code (index.js)

Create a file named `index.js` in your project directory and add the following code:

```javascript
// index.js
require('dotenv').config()
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
const twilio = require('twilio')

const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
const twilioPhoneNumber = process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
const myPhoneNumber = process.env.MY_PHONE_NUMBER
const weatherApiKey = process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY
const cityId = process.env.CITY_ID

const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken)

async function getWeather() {
  try {
    const weatherApiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=${cityId}&appid=${weatherApiKey}&units=metric` // Using metric units for Celsius
    const response = await fetch(weatherApiUrl)

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)
    }

    const data = await response.json()
    return data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching weather:', error)
    return null
  }
}

async function sendWeatherNotification() {
  const weatherData = await getWeather()

  if (!weatherData) {
    console.log('Failed to retrieve weather data.')
    return
  }

  const temperature = weatherData.main.temp
  const description = weatherData.weather[0].description
  const cityName = weatherData.name

  const messageBody = `
  Good morning! ☀️
  Weather in ${cityName}:
  Temperature: ${temperature}°C
  Description: ${description}
  Have a great day!
  `

  try {
    const message = await client.messages.create({
      body: messageBody,
      from: twilioPhoneNumber,
      to: myPhoneNumber,
    })

    console.log(`Message sent! SID: ${message.sid}`)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending message:', error)
  }
}

sendWeatherNotification() // Call the function to send the message
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`require('dotenv').config();`**: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file.
2.  **Import necessary modules:** `node-fetch` for making API requests, and `twilio` for sending SMS messages.
3.  **Retrieve credentials from environment variables:** Access your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, Twilio phone number, your phone number, and weather API key.
4.  **Create a Twilio client:** Instantiate the Twilio client using your Account SID and Auth Token.
5.  **`getWeather()` function:**
    - Constructs the API URL to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap using your API key and the city ID. You can change the `units` parameter to `"imperial"` if you prefer Fahrenheit.
    - Uses `node-fetch` to make an HTTP request to the weather API.
    - Parses the JSON response and returns the weather data.
    - Includes error handling for API request failures.
6.  **`sendWeatherNotification()` function:**
    - Calls the `getWeather()` function to retrieve the weather data.
    - Extracts the temperature, description, and city name from the weather data.
    - Constructs the SMS message body with the weather information.
    - Uses the Twilio client to send an SMS message to your phone number.
    - Logs the message SID (unique identifier for the message) to the console.
    - Includes error handling for message sending failures.
7.  **`sendWeatherNotification()` call:** Calls the `sendWeatherNotification` function to immediately send a weather notification upon script execution. This is useful for testing.

## Running the Application

Now you can run your application by executing the following command in your terminal:

```plaintext
node index.js
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should receive an SMS message with the current weather forecast.

## Scheduling the Notification (Cron Job)

To send the notification daily, you'll need to schedule the script to run automatically. One common way to do this is using a cron job.

**Using `node-cron`:**

1.  **Install `node-cron`:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install node-cron  # Or yarn add node-cron
    ```

2.  **Modify `index.js` to include `node-cron`:**

        ```javascript
        // index.js
        require('dotenv').config();
        const fetch = require('node-fetch');
        const twilio = require('twilio');
        const cron = require('node-cron');

        const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
        const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;
        const twilioPhoneNumber = process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER;
        const myPhoneNumber = process.env.MY_PHONE_NUMBER;
        const weatherApiKey = process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY;
        const cityId = process.env.CITY_ID;

        const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken);

        async function getWeather() {
          try {
            const weatherApiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=${cityId}&appid=${weatherApiKey}&units=metric`; // Using metric units for Celsius
            const response = await fetch(weatherApiUrl);

            if (!response.ok) {
              throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
            }

            const data = await response.json();
            return data;
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching weather:', error);
            return null;
          }
        }

        async function sendWeatherNotification() {
          const weatherData = await getWeather();

          if (!weatherData) {
            console.log('Failed to retrieve weather data.');
            return;
          }

          const temperature = weatherData.main.temp;
          const description = weatherData.weather[0].description;
          const cityName = weatherData.name;

          const messageBody = `
          Good morning! ☀️
          Weather in ${cityName}:
          Temperature: ${temperature}°C
          Description: ${description}
          Have a great day!
          `;

          try {
            const message = await client.messages.create({
              body: messageBody,
              from: twilioPhoneNumber,
              to: myPhoneNumber,
            });

            console.log(`Message sent! SID: ${message.sid}`);
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error sending message:', error);
          }
        }

        // Schedule the task to run every day at 7:00 AM
        cron.schedule('0 7 * * *', () => {
          console.log('Running weather notification task...');
          sendWeatherNotification();
        });

        console.log('Weather notification scheduler started.'); // Confirmation message
        ```

        *   **`cron.schedule('0 7 * * *', ...)`:** This schedules the `sendWeatherNotification()` function to run every day at 7:00 AM.  The cron expression `0 7 * * *` means:
            *   `0`:  At minute 0 (of the hour).
            *   `7`:  At hour 7 (AM).
            *   `*`:  Every day of the month.
            *   `*`:  Every month.
            *   `*`:  Every day of the week.
        *   You can adjust the cron expression to suit your preferred notification time.  Use a cron expression generator (like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/)) to help you create the correct expression.

3.  **Run the application again:**

    ```plaintext
    node index.js
    ```

    This time, the script will start the scheduler and wait for the scheduled time to send the notification. The script will continue running in the background. You might need a process manager like `pm2` to ensure the script stays running persistently.

**Using system crontab (Linux/macOS):**

1.  Open the crontab editor:

    ```plaintext
    crontab -e
    ```

    This will open the crontab file in a text editor. If it's your first time, you might be asked to choose an editor.

2.  Add a line to schedule the script:

    ```
    0 7 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/weather-notifications/index.js
    ```

    - Replace `/path/to/your/weather-notifications/index.js` with the actual path to your `index.js` file.
    - Replace `/usr/bin/node` with the path to your Node.js executable if it's not in the default location. You can find it using the command `which node`.
    - `0 7 * * *` schedules the script to run at 7:00 AM every day (same as before).

3.  Save the file and exit the editor. The cron job will be automatically installed.

**Important Notes about Cron Jobs:**

- **Full Paths:** When using system crontab, always use absolute paths to your Node.js executable and your script file.
- **Environment Variables:** Cron jobs often run in a limited environment, so they might not have access to your `.env` file. You can either:
  - Source your `.env` file in the crontab command: `. /path/to/your/weather-notifications/.env && /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/weather-notifications/index.js` (This is generally not recommended for security reasons).
  - Set the environment variables directly in the crontab file: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...; TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...; ... /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/weather-notifications/index.js` (Again, not recommended for sensitive data).
  - The **best** approach is to set the environment variables at the system level or user level, outside of the cron job or `.env` file. This ensures they are available to cron without exposing them directly.
- **Logging:** Redirect the output of your script to a log file to help with debugging:

  ```
  0 7 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/weather-notifications/index.js >> /path/to/your/weather-notifications/weather.log 2>&1
  ```

  This will append both standard output and standard error to the `weather.log` file.

## Error Handling and Logging

Robust error handling and logging are crucial for any automated system. In the code above, we've included basic error handling using `try...catch` blocks and `console.error()`.

Consider adding more sophisticated logging using a dedicated logging library like `winston` or `pino`. This allows you to:

- Log to files with different levels of severity (e.g., info, warning, error).
- Rotate log files to prevent them from growing too large.
- Centralize your logs for easier monitoring and analysis.

## Enhancements and Further Development

Here are some ideas for enhancing your weather notification system:

- **User Configuration:** Allow users to specify their location and preferred notification time through a web interface or a command-line tool.
- **Weather Alerts:** Implement logic to send alerts only when certain weather conditions are met (e.g., high temperature, rain, snow).
- **Multiple Cities:** Support notifications for multiple cities.
- **Different Weather APIs:** Experiment with other weather APIs, such as AccuWeather, Weatherbit, or ClimaCell.
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Adjust the notification schedule based on user preferences or weather patterns.
- **Interactive Notifications:** Use Twilio's capabilities to allow users to reply to the SMS message to request more detailed weather information.

## Conclusion

This guide has demonstrated how to build a simple yet powerful daily weather notification system using Node.js, a free weather API, and the Twilio API. By automating this process, you can stay informed about the weather without having to manually check weather apps or websites. This project provides a great starting point for exploring the possibilities of automation and notification systems with Node.js and Twilio. Remember to always handle API keys and credentials securely and adhere to the usage guidelines of the weather API provider.
