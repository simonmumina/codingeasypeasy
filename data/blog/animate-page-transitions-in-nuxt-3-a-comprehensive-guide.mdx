# Animate Page Transitions in Nuxt 3: A Comprehensive Guide

Page transitions are a crucial aspect of modern web development, contributing significantly to the overall user experience. Smooth, well-designed transitions can make your website feel more polished, professional, and engaging. This guide will walk you through various techniques for animating page transitions in Nuxt 3, leveraging the power of Vue.js transitions and Nuxt's built-in features.

## Why Animate Page Transitions?

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly discuss the benefits of animated page transitions:

- **Improved User Experience:** Transitions provide visual feedback, making navigation feel more natural and intuitive.
- **Reduced Perceived Loading Time:** Animations can distract users while content is loading in the background, making the wait feel shorter.
- **Enhanced Brand Identity:** Consistent and well-executed transitions can reinforce your brand's visual style.
- **Clearer Navigation:** Transitions can guide users and highlight the relationship between pages, improving site navigation.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of Vue.js and Nuxt 3.
- A Nuxt 3 project already set up. If you don't have one, you can create a new project with:

  ```bash
  npx nuxi init my-nuxt-app
  cd my-nuxt-app
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

## Method 1: Using `<Transition>` Component in `app.vue`

This is the simplest and most common approach to animate page transitions in Nuxt 3. We'll use the `<Transition>` component within the `app.vue` file, which wraps the `<NuxtPage>` component.

1.  **Open `app.vue` (or create it if it doesn't exist).**

2.  **Wrap `<NuxtPage>` with `<Transition>`:**

    ```plaintext
    <template>
      <div>
        <Transition name="page" mode="out-in">
          <NuxtPage :key="$route.fullPath" />
        </Transition>
      </div>
    </template>

    <style scoped>
    /*  Optional:  Add some basic styling for the layout */
    div {
      min-height: 100vh;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
    }
    </style>
    ```

    - **`name="page"`:** This tells Vue.js to look for CSS classes prefixed with `page-` for the transition.
    - **`mode="out-in"`:** This ensures that the exiting page is fully animated out _before_ the new page is animated in. Other options are `in-out` which animates in and out at the same time (often less desirable for page transitions)
    - **`:key="$route.fullPath"`:** This is crucial for Vue.js to properly detect page changes and trigger the transition. Using `$route.fullPath` as the key ensures that even transitions between routes with the same component but different query parameters work correctly.

3.  **Define CSS Classes in `assets/css/global.css` (or your main CSS file):**

    Create or modify your global CSS file to include the transition classes. Here's a basic example:

    ```css
    .page-enter-active,
    .page-leave-active {
      transition: opacity 0.3s;
    }

    .page-enter-from,
    .page-leave-to {
      opacity: 0;
    }
    ```

    - **`.page-enter-active`:** Applied during the entire entering phase. This is where you define the `transition` property.
    - **`.page-leave-active`:** Applied during the entire leaving phase. This is also where you define the `transition` property.
    - **`.page-enter-from`:** Applied _before_ the entering animation starts. This defines the initial state.
    - **`.page-leave-to`:** Applied _after_ the leaving animation completes. This defines the final state.

    **Explanation:**

    - When a new page enters, Vue.js adds the classes in the following order: `.page-enter-from`, `.page-enter-active`. After a short delay, `.page-enter-from` is removed and the animation starts.
    - When a page leaves, Vue.js adds the classes in the following order: `.page-leave-active`, `.page-leave-to`. After a short delay, `.page-leave-to` is removed, completing the animation.

4.  **Import the CSS in your `nuxt.config.ts`:**

    Make sure your global CSS file is imported in your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

    ```typescript
    // https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      css: ['~/assets/css/global.css'], // Adjust the path if necessary
    })
    ```

**Customizing the Transition**

You can customize the transition by modifying the CSS classes. Here are some examples:

- **Fade and Slide:**

  ```css
  .page-enter-active,
  .page-leave-active {
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
  }

  .page-enter-from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(20px);
  }

  .page-leave-to {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-20px);
  }
  ```

- **Zoom In/Out:**

  ```css
  .page-enter-active,
  .page-leave-active {
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
  }

  .page-enter-from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }

  .page-leave-to {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
  ```

Experiment with different CSS properties like `opacity`, `transform`, `scale`, `rotate`, and `filter` to create unique and engaging transitions.

## Method 2: Using JavaScript Hooks

For more complex animations or when you need to control the animation with JavaScript, you can use the `<Transition>` component's JavaScript hooks:

- `before-enter`
- `enter`
- `after-enter`
- `enter-cancelled`
- `before-leave`
- `leave`
- `after-leave`
- `leave-cancelled`

1.  **Modify `app.vue` to include the JavaScript hooks:**

    ```plaintext
    <template>
      <div>
        <Transition
          name="page"
          mode="out-in"
          @before-enter="beforeEnter"
          @enter="enter"
          @after-enter="afterEnter"
          @leave="leave"
          @after-leave="afterLeave"
        >
          <NuxtPage :key="$route.fullPath" />
        </Transition>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    import { ref } from 'vue';

    const beforeEnter = (el) => {
      el.style.opacity = 0; // Initial state before entering
    };

    const enter = (el, done) => {
      // Animate the element
      gsap.to(el, {  // Example using GreenSock (GSAP) for animation
        opacity: 1,
        duration: 0.5,
        onComplete: done, // Call `done` when the animation is complete
      });
    };

    const afterEnter = (el) => {
      // Optional: Code to run after the enter animation is complete
    };

    const leave = (el, done) => {
      // Animate the element
      gsap.to(el, {
        opacity: 0,
        duration: 0.5,
        onComplete: done,
      });
    };

    const afterLeave = (el) => {
      // Optional: Code to run after the leave animation is complete
    };
    </script>
    ```

    - **Important:** You _must_ call the `done` callback function passed to the `enter` and `leave` hooks when your animation is complete. This tells Vue.js that the transition is finished.
    - This example uses GreenSock (GSAP) for animation. You'll need to install it: `npm install gsap`. Also make sure to import `gsap` somewhere, either in `app.vue` or using a plugin. `import gsap from 'gsap';`

2.  **Explanation:**

    - **`beforeEnter(el)`:** Called right before the element is inserted into the DOM. You can use this to set the initial state of the element.
    - **`enter(el, done)`:** Called when the element is inserted into the DOM. This is where you start the entering animation. The `done` callback must be called when the animation is complete.
    - **`afterEnter(el)`:** Called after the entering animation is complete.
    - **`leave(el, done)`:** Called right before the element is removed from the DOM. This is where you start the leaving animation. The `done` callback must be called when the animation is complete.
    - **`afterLeave(el)`:** Called after the leaving animation is complete.

**Example using CSS transitions within JavaScript Hooks:**

Although we use GSAP in the above example, we can use CSS transitions.

```plaintext
    <template>
      <div>
        <Transition
          name="page"
          mode="out-in"
          @before-enter="beforeEnter"
          @enter="enter"
          @after-enter="afterEnter"
          @leave="leave"
          @after-leave="afterLeave"
        >
          <NuxtPage :key="$route.fullPath" />
        </Transition>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    const beforeEnter = (el) => {
      el.style.opacity = 0;
    };

    const enter = (el, done) => {
      // Force a layout so that the transition can be triggered.
      el.offsetWidth;

      el.style.transition = 'opacity 0.5s';
      el.style.opacity = 1;

      el.addEventListener('transitionend', () => {
        done();
      });
    };

    const afterEnter = (el) => {
      el.style.transition = ''; // Reset transition after it completes
    };

    const leave = (el, done) => {
      el.style.transition = 'opacity 0.5s';
      el.style.opacity = 0;

      el.addEventListener('transitionend', () => {
        done();
      });
    };

    const afterLeave = (el) => {
       el.style.transition = ''; // Reset transition after it completes
    };
    </script>
```

This example sets up transitions using `transitionend` event listener to tell Vue when the transition is completed.

## Method 3: Using `<PageTransition>` Component (Advanced)

Nuxt 3 provides a `<PageTransition>` component which allows you to define page transitions within your page components themselves. This approach gives you more granular control and allows you to create page-specific transitions.

1.  **Enable `<PageTransition>` in `nuxt.config.ts`:**

    ```typescript
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      experimental: {
        viewTransition: true, // Enable view transitions (required for <PageTransition>)
      },
    })
    ```

2.  **Use `<PageTransition>` within a page component (e.g., `pages/index.vue`):**

    ```plaintext
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to the Home Page!</h1>
        <NuxtLink to="/about">Go to About Page</NuxtLink>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    definePageMeta({
      pageTransition: {
        name: 'slide-left',
        mode: 'out-in',
      },
    });
    </script>
    ```

3.  **Define CSS classes in `assets/css/global.css`:**

    ```css
    .slide-left-enter-active,
    .slide-left-leave-active {
      transition: all 0.4s ease;
      position: absolute; /* Required for proper sliding */
      width: 100%; /* Required for proper sliding */
    }

    .slide-left-enter-from {
      transform: translateX(100%);
      opacity: 0;
    }

    .slide-left-leave-to {
      transform: translateX(-100%);
      opacity: 0;
    }
    ```

    **Important Considerations for `<PageTransition>`:**

    - You **must** set `position: absolute` on the transition elements (or a containing element) and a defined width (e.g. `100%`). This is because `<PageTransition>` essentially stacks the exiting and entering pages on top of each other during the transition. Without `position: absolute`, the exiting page won't slide away.
    - Ensure `viewTransition: true` is enabled in your `nuxt.config.ts`.
    - The transition name defined in `definePageMeta` (e.g., `'slide-left'`) corresponds to the CSS class prefixes.
    - Using `definePageMeta` means you need to use the Composition API `<script setup>`.

**Creating different transitions for different pages:**

The real power of `<PageTransition>` comes from being able to define different transitions for different pages. For example, you could have a "slide-right" transition for going from the home page to the about page, and a "slide-left" transition for going back.

**Example with two different transitions:**

- `pages/index.vue`:

  ```plaintext
  <template>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Home Page!</h1>
      <NuxtLink to="/about">Go to About Page</NuxtLink>
    </div>
  </template>

  <script setup>
  definePageMeta({
    pageTransition: {
      name: 'slide-left',
      mode: 'out-in',
    },
  });
  </script>
  ```

- `pages/about.vue`:

  ```plaintext
  <template>
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <NuxtLink to="/">Go to Home Page</NuxtLink>
    </div>
  </template>

  <script setup>
  definePageMeta({
    pageTransition: {
      name: 'slide-right',
      mode: 'out-in',
    },
  });
  </script>
  ```

- `assets/css/global.css`:

  ```css
  .slide-left-enter-active,
  .slide-left-leave-active,
  .slide-right-enter-active,
  .slide-right-leave-active {
    transition: all 0.4s ease;
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
  }

  .slide-left-enter-from {
    transform: translateX(100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }

  .slide-left-leave-to {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }

  .slide-right-enter-from {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }

  .slide-right-leave-to {
    transform: translateX(100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  ```

## Method 4: Named Transitions (More Advanced Control)

Named transitions allow you to define specific transitions for different routes or scenarios. This gives you the most control over your page transitions.

1.  **In `app.vue`, use a dynamic `:name` for the `<Transition>` component:**

    ```plaintext
    <template>
      <div>
        <Transition :name="transitionName" mode="out-in">
          <NuxtPage :key="$route.fullPath" />
        </Transition>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    import { computed } from 'vue';
    import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

    const route = useRoute();

    const transitionName = computed(() => {
      // Define your transition logic based on the route
      if (route.path === '/about') {
        return 'slide-left';
      } else if (route.path === '/') {
        return 'slide-right';
      } else {
        return 'fade'; // Default transition
      }
    });
    </script>
    ```

2.  **Define CSS classes for each named transition in `assets/css/global.css`:**

    You'll need to define CSS classes for `slide-left`, `slide-right`, and `fade` as shown in the previous examples.

**Explanation:**

- We use `useRoute` to access the current route.
- The `transitionName` computed property determines the transition name based on the current route. You can customize this logic to suit your needs.
- The `<Transition>` component dynamically uses the `transitionName` to apply the appropriate CSS classes.

## Performance Considerations

While page transitions enhance user experience, it's crucial to be mindful of performance:

- **Keep transitions short and simple:** Complex animations can impact performance, especially on lower-powered devices. Aim for durations around 0.3-0.5 seconds.
- **Use hardware-accelerated CSS properties:** `transform` and `opacity` are generally more performant than other properties like `left`, `top`, `width`, or `height`.
- **Avoid animating large images:** Animating large images can be resource-intensive. Consider optimizing images or using placeholders during transitions.
- **Test on different devices:** Test your transitions on a variety of devices and browsers to ensure smooth performance.

## Conclusion

Animating page transitions in Nuxt 3 is a powerful way to enhance the user experience of your web applications. By using Vue.js transitions and Nuxt's built-in features, you can create smooth, engaging, and visually appealing transitions that will delight your users. Experiment with different techniques and CSS properties to find the perfect transitions for your website. Remember to consider performance and test on various devices to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone. Happy coding!
