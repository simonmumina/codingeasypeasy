# Monetize Your Expo Apps: A Comprehensive Guide to Expo Ads AdMob

Monetizing mobile applications is crucial for developers to sustain their work and continue creating valuable content. For React Native developers using Expo, the `expo-ads-admob` library offers a straightforward and effective way to integrate Google AdMob into their apps. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process, from initial setup to advanced techniques for maximizing your ad revenue.

## What is Expo Ads AdMob?

`expo-ads-admob` is a React Native module for Expo that allows you to display Google AdMob ads in your application. It provides components and hooks to easily implement various ad formats like banner ads, interstitial ads, rewarded ads, and app open ads. It's a wrapper around the native AdMob SDKs for both iOS and Android, simplifying integration and cross-platform compatibility.

## Why Use Expo Ads AdMob?

- **Simplified Integration:** Expo simplifies the process of adding native modules, and `expo-ads-admob` makes AdMob integration even easier. You avoid the complexities of manually linking native libraries.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Write your code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android with minimal platform-specific adjustments.
- **Wide Range of Ad Formats:** Support for various AdMob ad formats allows you to choose the best options for your app's design and user experience.
- **Expo Go Support:** You can test most of the features of `expo-ads-admob` directly in the Expo Go app during development.
- **Reliable and Well-Maintained:** The library is actively maintained and widely used within the Expo community.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **An Expo project:** If you don't have one, create a new Expo project using `expo init my-app`.
- **A Google AdMob account:** Create an account at [https://admob.google.com/](https://admob.google.com/) and set up your app to receive an AdMob app ID.
- **Ad unit IDs:** Generate ad unit IDs for the specific ad formats you plan to use (banner, interstitial, rewarded, etc.) within the AdMob console. **Important:** Use test ad unit IDs during development to avoid accidentally violating AdMob policies.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Install the package:**

    ```plaintext
    npx expo install expo-ads-admob
    ```

2.  **Configure `app.json` (or `app.config.js`):**

    Add the `adMobApplicationId` to your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file. Replace `YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID` with your actual AdMob app ID.

    ```plaintext
    {
      "expo": {
        // ... other configurations
        "android": {
          "adMobApplicationId": "YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"
        },
        "ios": {
          "adMobApplicationId": "YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, if using `app.config.js`:

    ```plaintext
    export default ({ config }) => {
      return {
        ...config,
        android: {
          ...config.android,
          adMobApplicationId: 'YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID',
        },
        ios: {
          ...config.ios,
          adMobApplicationId: 'YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID',
        },
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Rebuild your app:**

    After modifying your `app.json` or `app.config.js`, you need to rebuild your native app. Run:

    ```plaintext
    npx expo prebuild
    npx expo run:android  # or npx expo run:ios
    ```

    This creates the `android` and `ios` folders in your project and configures them with your AdMob app ID. If you've already prebuilt your app, you might need to clear the cache by running `expo prebuild --clean`.

## Implementing Banner Ads

Banner ads are rectangular ads that typically appear at the top or bottom of the screen.

1.  **Import the `BannerAd` component:**

    ```plaintext
    import { BannerAd, BannerAdSize } from 'expo-ads-admob'
    ```

2.  **Use the `BannerAd` component in your UI:**

    ```plaintext
    import React from 'react'
    import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
    import { BannerAd, BannerAdSize } from 'expo-ads-admob'

    const BannerAdExample = () => {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <BannerAd
            unitId="ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyy" // Replace with your test or production banner ad unit ID
            size={BannerAdSize.SMART_BANNER}
            requestOptions={{
              requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly: true, // Respect user privacy settings
            }}
            onDidFailToReceiveAdWithError={(error) => console.log(error)}
          />
        </View>
      )
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    })

    export default BannerAdExample
    ```

    - **`unitId`:** This is your AdMob ad unit ID for the banner ad. **IMPORTANT:** Use a test ad unit ID during development (available on the AdMob website). Replace `"ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyy"` with your actual AdMob banner ad unit ID.
    - **`size`:** Specifies the size of the banner ad. Common sizes include `BannerAdSize.BANNER`, `BannerAdSize.LARGE_BANNER`, `BannerAdSize.MEDIUM_RECTANGLE`, and `BannerAdSize.SMART_BANNER`. `SMART_BANNER` adapts to the screen size.
    - **`requestOptions`:** Allows you to configure ad requests. `requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly: true` is recommended to respect user privacy preferences and comply with GDPR and CCPA regulations.
    - **`onDidFailToReceiveAdWithError`:** A callback function that is called when the ad fails to load. This is useful for debugging.

## Implementing Interstitial Ads

Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the entire app interface. They are typically displayed at natural transition points in your app, such as when finishing a level or navigating between sections.

1.  **Import the necessary hooks:**

    ```plaintext
    import { AdEventType, useInterstitialAd } from 'expo-ads-admob'
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
    ```

2.  **Use the `useInterstitialAd` hook:**

    ```plaintext
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
    import { View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native'
    import { AdEventType, useInterstitialAd } from 'expo-ads-admob'

    const InterstitialAdExample = () => {
      const [isAdReady, setIsAdReady] = useState(false)

      const { loaded, error, load, show } = useInterstitialAd({
        adUnitId: 'ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx/zzzzzzzzzzzz', // Replace with your test or production interstitial ad unit ID
      })

      useEffect(() => {
        load() // Load the ad on component mount

        if (loaded) {
          setIsAdReady(true)
        }

        if (error) {
          console.error('Interstitial ad failed to load:', error)
          setIsAdReady(false)
        }
      }, [loaded, error, load])

      const handleShowAd = async () => {
        if (isAdReady && loaded) {
          try {
            await show()
          } catch (e) {
            console.error('Error showing interstitial ad:', e)
          }

          // Reload the ad after it's shown (or fails)
          load()
          setIsAdReady(false) //prevent double-showing
        } else {
          Alert.alert('Ad not ready yet!')
          load() //try to reload the ad
        }
      }

      return (
        <View>
          <Button title="Show Interstitial Ad" onPress={handleShowAd} />
        </View>
      )
    }

    export default InterstitialAdExample
    ```

    - **`adUnitId`:** Your AdMob ad unit ID for the interstitial ad. Remember to use a test ID during development.
    - **`loaded`:** A boolean indicating whether the ad has loaded successfully.
    - **`error`:** An error object if the ad failed to load.
    - **`load()`:** A function that loads the ad.
    - **`show()`:** A function that displays the ad.
    - It's crucial to reload the ad after it's shown to ensure a new ad is available for the next time.

## Implementing Rewarded Ads

Rewarded ads allow users to earn in-app rewards by watching a short video ad.

1.  **Import the necessary hooks:**

    ```plaintext
    import { AdEventType, useRewardedAd } from 'expo-ads-admob'
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
    ```

2.  **Use the `useRewardedAd` hook:**

    ```plaintext
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
    import { View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native'
    import { AdEventType, useRewardedAd } from 'expo-ads-admob'

    const RewardedAdExample = () => {
      const [rewarded, setRewarded] = useState(false)
      const { loaded, error, load, show } = useRewardedAd({
        adUnitId: 'ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx/aaaaaaaaaaaaa', // Replace with your test or production rewarded ad unit ID
      })

      useEffect(() => {
        load()
      }, [load])

      useEffect(() => {
        if (error) {
          console.error(error)
        }
      }, [error])

      const handleShowAd = async () => {
        if (loaded) {
          try {
            await show()

            // Optionally reload the ad immediately after showing. This might depend on your app's logic.
            load() // Reload the ad for future use.
          } catch (e) {
            console.error('Failed to show rewarded ad: ', e)
          }
        } else {
          Alert.alert('Ad is not ready yet. Please try again in a moment.')
        }
      }

      return (
        <View>
          <Button title="Watch Ad for Reward" onPress={handleShowAd} disabled={!loaded} />
          {rewarded && <Alert>You have been rewarded!</Alert>}
        </View>
      )
    }

    export default RewardedAdExample
    ```

    - **`adUnitId`:** Your AdMob ad unit ID for the rewarded ad. Use a test ID during development.
    - **`loaded`:** Indicates whether the ad has loaded successfully.
    - **`error`:** An error object if the ad failed to load.
    - **`load()`:** Loads the ad.
    - **`show()`:** Displays the ad.
    - Important: You should reward the user only _after_ the `onRewarded` event is triggered. This event is automatically handled by the `useRewardedAd` hook internally.

## Testing Your AdMob Integration

**Crucially, always use test ad unit IDs during development and testing.** Using live ad unit IDs can lead to accidental clicks and invalid activity, which can result in your AdMob account being banned.

AdMob provides test ad unit IDs that you can use for testing purposes. You can find them on the AdMob website.

## Best Practices for AdMob Implementation

- **Respect User Experience:** Avoid intrusive ad placements that disrupt the user experience. Don't place ads where users are likely to accidentally click them.
- **Ad Placement Strategy:** Carefully consider where to place your ads. Banner ads typically perform well at the top or bottom of the screen, while interstitial and rewarded ads should be displayed at natural transition points in your app.
- **Ad Frequency:** Don't overload your app with ads. Too many ads can irritate users and lead to them uninstalling your app. Balance monetization with user experience.
- **Privacy:** Always respect user privacy settings. Use the `requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly` option to ensure that you are not collecting personal data from users who have opted out of personalized ads.
- **Monitor Performance:** Regularly monitor your AdMob performance metrics, such as impression rate, click-through rate (CTR), and eCPM, to identify areas for improvement.
- **AdMob Policies:** Adhere strictly to Google AdMob's policies. Violations can result in account suspension. Refer to the official AdMob documentation for the latest policies.
- **Implement Ad Refreshing (for Banner Ads):** Configure banner ads to refresh automatically at a reasonable interval (e.g., every 30-60 seconds) to maximize impressions. However, be mindful of battery consumption.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Ads not loading:** Check your ad unit IDs, network connection, and AdMob account status. Ensure you're using test ad unit IDs during development.
- **AdMob account suspended:** Review your AdMob account for policy violations and address them promptly.
- **Blank ad spaces:** Verify that your ad unit IDs are correct and that your app is properly configured in the AdMob console. Check for any errors in your code related to ad loading.
- **Build fails on native platforms:** Ensure that `expo prebuild` has completed successfully and that your native dependencies are correctly installed. Sometimes clearing your gradle cache or CocoaPods cache can help.

## Conclusion

`expo-ads-admob` provides a powerful and convenient way to monetize your Expo and React Native apps. By following the guidelines in this comprehensive guide, you can seamlessly integrate AdMob ads, optimize your ad placements, and maximize your revenue while maintaining a positive user experience. Remember to always use test ad unit IDs during development, adhere to AdMob policies, and continuously monitor your ad performance to achieve the best results. Happy monetizing!
