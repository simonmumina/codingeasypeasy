# Sending Emails with Attachments using Nodemailer in Node.js: A Comprehensive Guide

Sending emails is a common requirement for many web applications. Whether it's sending confirmation emails, password reset links, or simply notifying users, email functionality is crucial. Adding attachments to those emails often enhances the functionality and usefulness, allowing you to share documents, images, and more. This guide will walk you through the process of sending emails with attachments using Nodemailer in Node.js, providing clear code examples and explanations along the way.

## What is Nodemailer?

Nodemailer is a popular and well-maintained Node.js module that simplifies the process of sending emails. It supports various transport methods, including SMTP, Sendmail, and even services like Gmail, Outlook, and more. It offers a clean API and handles many of the complexities involved in email communication, such as encoding, formatting, and security.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn:** NPM comes bundled with Node.js. Yarn is an alternative package manager.

## Setting up Your Project

1.  **Create a new project directory:**

    ```plaintext
    mkdir nodemailer-attachment-example
    cd nodemailer-attachment-example
    ```

2.  **Initialize your project:**

    ```plaintext
    npm init -y  # Or yarn init -y
    ```

3.  **Install Nodemailer:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install nodemailer  # Or yarn add nodemailer
    ```

## Configuring Nodemailer

The first step is to configure Nodemailer with your email provider's credentials. You'll need to create a transporter object. This transporter handles the communication with the email server.

**Important Security Note:** For production environments, **never** hardcode your email credentials directly in your code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system. For this tutorial, we'll show the direct approach for simplicity, but _remember to use environment variables in your own projects!_

```javascript
// Import the Nodemailer module
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')

// Create a transporter object using SMTP
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.example.com', // Replace with your SMTP server
  port: 587, // Replace with your SMTP port (usually 587 or 465)
  secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
  auth: {
    user: 'your_email@example.com', // Replace with your email address
    pass: 'your_email_password', // Replace with your email password
  },
})

// Verify connection configuration
transporter.verify(function (error, success) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error)
  } else {
    console.log('Server is ready to take our messages')
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `require('nodemailer')`: Imports the Nodemailer module.
- `nodemailer.createTransport(options)`: Creates a transporter object. The `options` object specifies the connection details for your email provider.
  - `host`: Your SMTP server address (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`, `smtp.office365.com`).
  - `port`: The port number for your SMTP server (usually 587 or 465).
  - `secure`: Indicates whether to use SSL/TLS. `true` for port 465, `false` for other ports like 587 (when using STARTTLS).
  - `auth`: An object containing your email address (`user`) and password (`pass`).
- `transporter.verify()`: Verifies the connection to the email server. Useful for debugging.

**Using Gmail:**

If you're using Gmail, you'll need to enable "Less secure app access" in your Google account settings (search for it in your Google account security settings), or use OAuth2 authentication which is the recommended approach for security reasons. For simplicity, we'll show the "less secure app access" approach. _Remember to enable 2-Factor Authentication and use app-specific passwords if possible, even with "less secure app access"._

```javascript
// Example for Gmail (less secure app access - NOT recommended for production)
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'your_gmail_address@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your_gmail_password',
  },
})
```

**Important Note about Gmail and OAuth2:** Using "Less Secure App Access" is discouraged by Google. A more secure and recommended method is to use OAuth2. While a full OAuth2 implementation is beyond the scope of this basic guide, here's a simplified example illustrating the concept. You'll need to create OAuth2 credentials in the Google Cloud Console and configure your application accordingly. Refer to the Nodemailer documentation for a comprehensive guide on OAuth2 integration.

```javascript
// Example of Gmail with OAuth2 (simplified - requires Google Cloud Console setup)
// Replace with your actual OAuth2 credentials
// const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
//   service: 'gmail',
//   auth: {
//     type: 'OAuth2',
//     user: 'your_gmail_address@gmail.com',
//     clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
//     clientSecret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
//     refreshToken: 'YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN'
//   }
// });
```

## Sending an Email with Attachments

Now, let's send an email with one or more attachments.

```javascript
const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@example.com', // Sender address
  to: 'recipient_email@example.com', // Recipient address
  subject: 'Email with Attachments', // Subject line
  text: 'Please find the attached files.', // Plain text body
  html: '<p>Please find the attached files.</p>', // HTML body (optional)
  attachments: [
    {
      filename: 'document.pdf',
      path: './attachments/document.pdf', // Path to the attachment file
    },
    {
      filename: 'image.png',
      path: './attachments/image.png',
      cid: 'unique@kreata.ee', // Unique CID for embedding in HTML
    },
  ],
}

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function (error, info) {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error)
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response)
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `mailOptions`: An object containing the email configuration.
  - `from`: The sender's email address.
  - `to`: The recipient's email address.
  - `subject`: The email subject.
  - `text`: The plain text version of the email body.
  - `html`: The HTML version of the email body. Using both `text` and `html` provides better compatibility across different email clients.
  - `attachments`: An array of attachment objects. Each object describes a single attachment.
    - `filename`: The name of the file as it will appear in the email.
    - `path`: The path to the attachment file on your server.
    - `cid` (Content-ID): Optional. Used to embed images or other resources directly within the HTML content of the email. This allows you to display images inline rather than as separate attachments.

**Embedding Images in HTML (using CID):**

To embed an image directly into your HTML email body, you'll use the `cid` property in the attachment object and reference it in your HTML using the `<img>` tag:

```javascript
const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@example.com',
  to: 'recipient_email@example.com',
  subject: 'Embedded Image Example',
  html: '<p>Here is an image:</p><img src="cid:unique@kreata.ee"/>', // Embedded image
  attachments: [
    {
      filename: 'image.png',
      path: './attachments/image.png',
      cid: 'unique@kreata.ee', // Same CID as referenced in the HTML
    },
  ],
}
```

## Sending Attachments from Buffer or Stream

Instead of providing a file path, you can also send attachments from a buffer or stream. This is useful when you generate the attachment content dynamically or retrieve it from a database.

**From Buffer:**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@example.com',
  to: 'recipient_email@example.com',
  subject: 'Attachment from Buffer',
  text: 'Attached file is generated from a buffer.',
  attachments: [
    {
      filename: 'buffer_file.txt',
      content: Buffer.from('This is the content from the buffer.'),
    },
  ],
}
```

**From Stream:**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@example.com',
  to: 'recipient_email@example.com',
  subject: 'Attachment from Stream',
  text: 'Attached file is read from a stream.',
  attachments: [
    {
      filename: 'stream_file.txt',
      content: fs.createReadStream('./attachments/stream_file.txt'),
    },
  ],
}
```

## Error Handling

It's essential to handle potential errors when sending emails. Wrap the `transporter.sendMail` call in a `try...catch` block or use promises to catch errors gracefully.

```javascript
transporter
  .sendMail(mailOptions)
  .then((info) => {
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error)
  })
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that combines all the concepts:

```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')
const fs = require('fs')

// Create a transporter object (replace with your email provider details)
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.example.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: 'your_email@example.com',
    pass: 'your_email_password',
  },
})

// Email options
const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@example.com',
  to: 'recipient_email@example.com',
  subject: 'Email with Attachments (Complete Example)',
  html: '<p>Please find the attachments below, including an embedded image.</p><img src="cid:unique@kreata.ee">',
  attachments: [
    {
      filename: 'document.pdf',
      path: './attachments/document.pdf',
    },
    {
      filename: 'image.png',
      path: './attachments/image.png',
      cid: 'unique@kreata.ee',
    },
    {
      filename: 'buffer_file.txt',
      content: Buffer.from('This is the content from a buffer.'),
    },
    {
      filename: 'stream_file.txt',
      content: fs.createReadStream('./attachments/stream_file.txt'),
    },
  ],
}

// Send the email
transporter
  .sendMail(mailOptions)
  .then((info) => {
    console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error)
  })
```

**Remember to replace the placeholder email addresses, passwords, and server details with your actual credentials.** Also, create the `./attachments` directory and put some dummy files in there (e.g., `document.pdf`, `image.png`, `stream_file.txt`) for the example to work.

## Best Practices

- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like email credentials in environment variables, not directly in your code.
- **Implement Error Handling:** Always handle potential errors to prevent your application from crashing.
- **Use SSL/TLS:** Encrypt your email communication to protect sensitive data.
- **Consider using a dedicated email service:** For production environments, consider using a dedicated email service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES. These services offer better deliverability, scalability, and features like email tracking and analytics.
- **Validate Email Addresses:** Before sending emails, validate the recipient's email address to reduce bounces and improve your sender reputation.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your email sending functionality.
- **Properly Encode Attachments:** Ensure attachments are properly encoded to prevent display issues on different email clients.
