# Secure BootstrapVue Tooltips and Popovers: Sanitizing User Input to Prevent XSS

BootstrapVue provides a great way to add interactive tooltips and popovers to your Vue.js applications. However, when displaying user-provided content within these components, it's crucial to sanitize the input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This post explores how to sanitize user input effectively when working with BootstrapVue tooltips and popovers, protecting your application from potential security threats.

## What is XSS and Why is Sanitization Important?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to a variety of problems, including:

- **Data theft:** Stealing user credentials, session cookies, or sensitive information.
- **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.
- **Malware installation:** Installing malware on the user's computer.

When you display user input directly in your web application without proper sanitization, you're essentially giving attackers a way to inject their own code into your page. Tooltips and popovers, because they dynamically render content, are prime targets if not handled carefully.

## The Problem: Directly Using User Input in BootstrapVue Tooltips/Popovers

Consider a scenario where you're displaying a tooltip based on user-provided data:

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button id="tooltip-target">Hover Me</b-button>
    <b-tooltip target="tooltip-target" :title="userInput"></b-tooltip>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      userInput: '<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability!");</script> Hello!',
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

In this example, the `userInput` data property contains malicious JavaScript code. When the tooltip is rendered, the script will execute, displaying an alert box. This demonstrates a clear XSS vulnerability.

## Solutions: Sanitizing User Input

The key to preventing XSS is to sanitize the user input before displaying it in your tooltips and popovers. Sanitization involves removing or escaping potentially harmful characters or code. Here are several approaches:

### 1. Using `v-html` with Extreme Caution (Generally Discouraged)

While `v-html` allows you to render HTML directly, it's crucial to use it with extreme caution. If you're absolutely certain that the user input is safe and well-controlled (e.g., coming from a trusted source and already sanitized on the server-side), you _might_ consider using it. However, **it's generally best to avoid `v-html` if you can.**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button id="tooltip-target">Hover Me</b-button>
    <b-tooltip target="tooltip-target">
      <template #title>
        <div v-html="sanitizedInput"></div>
      </template>
    </b-tooltip>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify'; // Install: npm install dompurify

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      userInput: '<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability!");</script> Hello!',
    };
  },
  computed: {
    sanitizedInput() {
      return DOMPurify.sanitize(this.userInput);
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- We're using `v-html` to render the sanitized input.
- We're using the `DOMPurify` library to sanitize the input. `DOMPurify.sanitize()` removes or escapes any potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
- We've installed `DOMPurify` using `npm install dompurify`.

**Why `v-html` is risky:**

- It can be difficult to guarantee that the user input is always safe.
- Even if you sanitize the input on the client-side, an attacker might be able to bypass your sanitization logic.

### 2. Using Text Content and String Interpolation

This is the safest and recommended approach. Instead of rendering HTML, treat the user input as plain text and use string interpolation to display it. This prevents any HTML tags or scripts from being executed.

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button id="tooltip-target">Hover Me</b-button>
    <b-tooltip target="tooltip-target" :title="sanitizedInput"></b-tooltip>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      userInput: '<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability!");</script> Hello!',
    };
  },
  computed: {
    sanitizedInput() {
      // Option 1: Escape HTML entities manually (more verbose)
      // let escapedInput = this.userInput
      //   .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
      //   .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
      //   .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
      //   .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
      //   .replace(/'/g, '&#039;');
      // return escapedInput;

      //Option 2: Use a more robust HTML escaping library (e.g., lodash)
      // if (typeof _.escape === 'function') { // Make sure lodash is available
      //   return _.escape(this.userInput);
      // } else {
      //   console.warn("Lodash is not available. Using basic escaping as a fallback.");
      //   return this.userInput
      //     .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
      //     .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
      //     .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
      //     .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
      //     .replace(/'/g, '&#039;');
      // }

      //Option 3: If you are only concerned about basic HTML tags being interpreted, strip them.
      //return this.userInput.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '');

      return this.userInput; // In this example, we are treating the input as plain text
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- We're using the `:title` prop of the `<b-tooltip>` component to pass the sanitized input.
- The tooltip will interpret the input as plain text, and any HTML tags or scripts will be displayed as literal text.
- If you need to display some limited formatting (e.g., bold, italics), you could potentially use a markdown parser library (carefully) and render the resulting HTML _after_ sanitizing it with DOMPurify. However, this adds complexity and requires careful consideration.

**Why this is the safest approach:**

- It prevents any HTML tags or scripts from being executed.
- It's simple to implement and understand.
- It doesn't rely on external libraries or complex sanitization logic (unless you add markdown parsing, which requires sanitization afterwards).

### 3. Server-Side Sanitization

Ideally, you should sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it in your database. This ensures that the data is clean from the start and reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities throughout your application. Use a server-side language and framework like Node.js with Express, Python with Django or Flask, or PHP with Laravel, all which provide built-in sanitization functions or libraries.

For example, in Node.js, you can use libraries like `sanitize-html` or `DOMPurify`. This is the best practice because it ensures that the data is clean _before_ it even reaches the client.

## Best Practices for Sanitizing User Input

Here are some best practices to follow when sanitizing user input:

- **Sanitize on the server-side:** Sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it in your database. This is the most effective way to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Sanitize on the client-side:** Sanitize user input on the client-side before displaying it in your tooltips and popovers. This provides an extra layer of protection.
- **Use a reputable sanitization library:** Use a reputable sanitization library like `DOMPurify` to sanitize your user input. These libraries are regularly updated to address new security threats.
- **Treat user input as plain text whenever possible:** Avoid rendering HTML directly from user input. If you need to display some limited formatting, use a markdown parser library (carefully) and render the resulting HTML _after_ sanitizing it.
- **Contextualize your sanitization:** The type of sanitization you need to perform depends on the context in which the user input will be displayed. For example, if you're displaying user input in a tooltip, you might need to escape HTML entities. If you're displaying user input in a form field, you might need to remove HTML tags.
- **Test your sanitization logic:** Thoroughly test your sanitization logic to ensure that it's effective at preventing XSS vulnerabilities. Use tools like OWASP ZAP to scan your application for vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Sanitizing user input is crucial for preventing XSS vulnerabilities in your BootstrapVue applications. By following the best practices outlined in this post, you can protect your application from malicious attacks and ensure the security of your users' data. Remember to prioritize server-side sanitization and treat user input as plain text whenever possible. Always test your sanitization logic thoroughly to ensure that it's effective.
