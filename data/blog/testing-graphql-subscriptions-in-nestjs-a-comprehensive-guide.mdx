# Testing GraphQL Subscriptions in NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide

GraphQL subscriptions offer a powerful way to build real-time applications with NestJS. However, ensuring their reliability through comprehensive testing can be challenging. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of how to test GraphQL subscriptions within your NestJS application, leveraging Jest and Supertest. We'll cover setting up your testing environment, writing integration tests, and verifying that your subscriptions are functioning as expected.

## Why Test GraphQL Subscriptions?

Testing subscriptions is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of your real-time features.  Without proper testing, you risk:

*   **Broken Real-time Updates:**  Data inconsistencies and missed updates can severely impact user experience.
*   **Unexpected Errors:**  Subscription logic can be complex, and errors might not be immediately apparent during development.
*   **Difficult Debugging:**  Troubleshooting real-time issues without automated tests is time-consuming and error-prone.
*   **Regression Risks:**  Changes to your codebase can inadvertently break existing subscription functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Node.js:**  Version 16 or higher.
*   **NestJS CLI:**  Installed globally (`npm install -g @nestjs/cli`).
*   **NestJS Project:**  An existing NestJS project with GraphQL and subscription support configured. If you don't have one, you can quickly create one:

    ```bash
    nest new nest-graphql-subscriptions
    cd nest-graphql-subscriptions
    npm install @nestjs/graphql @nestjs/platform-express graphql apollo-server-express graphql-subscriptions
    ```

*   **Jest and Supertest:**  These are our primary testing tools. If they're not already in your `devDependencies`, install them:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev jest supertest @types/jest @types/supertest ts-jest
    ```

## Setting up the Testing Environment

### 1. Configure Jest

Configure Jest by creating or modifying your `jest.config.js` (or `jest.config.ts`) file. This configuration will tell Jest how to handle TypeScript files and import paths.

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  moduleFileExtensions: ['js', 'json', 'ts'],
  rootDir: 'src',
  testRegex: '.*\\.spec\\.ts$',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(t|j)s$': 'ts-jest',
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: ['**/*.(t|j)s'],
  coverageDirectory: '../coverage',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/$1',
  },
};
```

### 2. Configure `tsconfig.json`

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` file includes the necessary compiler options for Jest to work correctly. Pay particular attention to `esModuleInterop` and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... other options
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "module": "commonjs", // Or another module system compatible with your setup
    "target": "es2017",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Create a Test Module

Create a separate test module to set up your NestJS application for testing.  This allows you to control dependencies and avoid polluting your main application module.  Create a file named `test.module.ts` (or similar) within your test directory.

```typescript
// src/test/test.module.ts

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { ApolloDriver, ApolloDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo';
import { ExampleResolver } from '../example/example.resolver'; // Replace with your actual resolvers
import { ExampleService } from '../example/example.service'; // Replace with your actual service

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloDriverConfig>({
      driver: ApolloDriver,
      autoSchemaFile: true, // or a specific path if you prefer
      installSubscriptionHandlers: true, // Crucial for subscriptions
      playground: false, // Disable playground in test
      introspection: false // Disable introspection in test
    }),
  ],
  providers: [ExampleResolver, ExampleService], // Add your resolvers and services
})
export class TestModule {}
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **`installSubscriptionHandlers: true`:** This is absolutely crucial. Without this, your subscriptions will not be correctly set up for testing.
*   **`playground: false` and `introspection: false`:**  These are good practices for production and testing environments. Disable the GraphQL Playground and introspection to prevent unauthorized access to your schema.  You can enable them temporarily for debugging if needed.

## Writing the Subscription Logic

Before we dive into testing, let's define a simple GraphQL subscription.  We'll use a simple `ExampleResolver` and `ExampleService` for demonstration.

```typescript
// src/example/example.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PubSub } from 'graphql-subscriptions';

@Injectable()
export class ExampleService {
  private readonly pubSub = new PubSub();

  publishMessage(message: string): void {
    this.pubSub.publish('messageCreated', { messageCreated: message });
  }

  getMessageStream() {
    return this.pubSub.asyncIterator('messageCreated');
  }
}
```

```typescript
// src/example/example.resolver.ts

import { Resolver, Query, Mutation, Subscription } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { ExampleService } from './example.service';

@Resolver()
export class ExampleResolver {
  constructor(private readonly exampleService: ExampleService) {}

  @Query(() => String)
  hello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }

  @Mutation(() => String)
  createMessage(@Args('message') message: string): string {
    this.exampleService.publishMessage(message);
    return `Message '${message}' published.`;
  }

  @Subscription(() => String)
  messageCreated() {
    return this.exampleService.getMessageStream();
  }
}
```

## Writing the Integration Test

Now, let's write the integration test to verify the functionality of our subscription.  Create a file named `example.resolver.spec.ts` (or similar) within your test directory.

```typescript
// src/example/example.resolver.spec.ts

import { Test, TestingModule } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { INestApplication } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as request from 'supertest';
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { ApolloDriver, ApolloDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo';
import { TestModule } from '../test/test.module';
import { ExampleService } from '../example/example.service';
import { PubSub } from 'graphql-subscriptions';

describe('ExampleResolver (e2e)', () => {
  let app: INestApplication;
  let exampleService: ExampleService;
  const pubSubMock = {
    publish: jest.fn(),
    asyncIterator: jest.fn().mockReturnValue([
      {messageCreated: "Test Message 1"},
      {messageCreated: "Test Message 2"}
    ]),
  };

  beforeAll(async () => {
    const moduleFixture: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
      imports: [TestModule],
    })
      .overrideProvider(ExampleService)
      .useValue({
        ...new ExampleService(), // Preserve other methods
        publishMessage: pubSubMock.publish,
        getMessageStream: () => pubSubMock.asyncIterator()
      })
      .compile();

    app = moduleFixture.createNestApplication();
    await app.init();
    exampleService = moduleFixture.get<ExampleService>(ExampleService);
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await app.close();
  });


  it('should receive messages from the subscription', async () => {
      // Create a mock for the GraphQL client to interact with the subscription
      const subscriptionQuery = `
        subscription {
          messageCreated
        }
      `;
      const createMessageMutation = `
      mutation {
        createMessage(message: "Test Message")
      }
    `;
    // Execute mutation which triggers publish
    await request(app.getHttpServer())
    .post('/graphql')
    .send({ query: createMessageMutation })
    .expect(200);
      // Make a request to the subscription endpoint
      const response = await request(app.getHttpServer())
        .post('/graphql')
        .send({ query: subscriptionQuery })
        .expect(200);
        expect(pubSubMock.publish).toHaveBeenCalled();
        expect(response.body.data.messageCreated).toBe("Test Message 1"); // Validate that the expected data is being returned
  });

});
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`beforeAll`:** This hook sets up the testing environment before running any tests.  It creates a NestJS application instance using `TestModule`, which configures the GraphQL module for testing.
2.  **`afterAll`:** This hook closes the application after all tests have finished, preventing resource leaks.
3. **Override Provider**: The `ExampleService` is overriden to mock the pubSub publish and asyncIterator methods.
4.  **`it('should receive messages from the subscription', async () => { ... })`:**  This is the core test case. It sends a GraphQL query to the subscription endpoint and asserts that the response contains the expected data.
    *   **Subscription Query:** A GraphQL subscription query is defined to listen for `messageCreated` events.
    *   **Execute Mutation**: Before calling the subscription, the `createMessage` mutation is called, which publishes a message to the PubSub.
    *   **Request to Subscription endpoint**: This part sends a request to the '/graphql' endpoint with the subscription query. Supertest helps to easily make requests to our endpoint and then assert on the response.
    *   **Expect Call to Publish**: Tests that the `publish` function was called.
    *   **Expect data**: Asserts that the subscription response contains the expected message.

## Running the Tests

Run your tests using the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e # Or your configured test script
```

Jest will execute the tests and report the results.  If all goes well, your test should pass, indicating that your GraphQL subscription is functioning correctly.

## Advanced Testing Techniques

### 1. Mocking the PubSub

In the example above, we mocked the `PubSub` to isolate the subscription logic. This is generally a good practice to avoid relying on external dependencies and to control the flow of events during testing.

### 2. Testing with Multiple Clients

For more complex scenarios, you might want to simulate multiple clients subscribing to the same endpoint. This can help identify potential concurrency issues or race conditions. You can achieve this by creating multiple instances of `request` and running them concurrently.

### 3. Handling Authentication

If your subscriptions require authentication, you'll need to include authentication headers or cookies in your test requests.  You can use the `set` method of the `request` object to add these headers.

### 4. Testing Error Scenarios

Don't forget to test error scenarios, such as invalid input, authorization failures, or network errors. This will help ensure that your subscriptions handle errors gracefully and provide informative feedback to clients.

## Conclusion

Testing GraphQL subscriptions in NestJS requires a slightly different approach compared to testing regular queries and mutations. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively test your subscription logic, ensuring the reliability and stability of your real-time features. Remember to mock dependencies, test with multiple clients (if applicable), and handle error scenarios to create a robust testing strategy. With comprehensive testing, you can confidently build and deploy real-time applications using NestJS and GraphQL subscriptions.
