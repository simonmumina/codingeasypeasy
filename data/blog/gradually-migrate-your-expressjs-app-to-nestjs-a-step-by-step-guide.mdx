# Gradually Migrate Your Express.js App to NestJS: A Step-by-Step Guide

Migrating a large and established Express.js application to NestJS can seem daunting. A complete rewrite is often impractical and risky.  This guide provides a practical, step-by-step approach to *gradually* migrate your Express.js app to NestJS, leveraging the power of TypeScript and a more structured architecture while minimizing disruption to your existing codebase.

## Why Migrate to NestJS?

Before we dive in, let's quickly recap why you might consider migrating to NestJS:

*   **Improved Architecture:** NestJS promotes a modular, testable, and maintainable architecture based on proven design patterns like dependency injection and inversion of control.
*   **TypeScript:**  Leveraging TypeScript's strong typing improves code quality, reduces errors, and enhances developer productivity.
*   **Dependency Injection:**  NestJS's built-in dependency injection container simplifies managing dependencies and promotes loose coupling.
*   **Modularity:**  NestJS's module system allows you to organize your application into logical units, making it easier to scale and maintain.
*   **Built-in Features:** NestJS offers built-in features like interceptors, guards, and pipes that simplify common development tasks.
*   **Testability:** The architecture promotes testability by design, making it easier to write unit and integration tests.

## The Hybrid Approach: Running Express and NestJS Together

The key to a successful gradual migration is to run both Express and NestJS side-by-side within the same application.  This allows you to incrementally replace Express routes with NestJS controllers, minimizing downtime and risk.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your NestJS Project

First, you'll need to install the Nest CLI and create a new NestJS project within your existing Express app's directory.

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
cd your-express-app
nest new nest-app --skip-git --directory nest
```

*   `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`: Installs the NestJS command-line interface globally.
*   `cd your-express-app`: Navigates to the root directory of your Express application.
*   `nest new nest-app --skip-git --directory nest`: Creates a new NestJS project named `nest-app` inside a directory called `nest`.  The `--skip-git` flag prevents initializing a new Git repository within the NestJS project (since your Express app already has one), and `--directory nest` ensures that the new NestJS project is created in a subdirectory named `nest`.

### Step 2: Configuring the NestJS App

Modify the `nest/src/main.ts` file to integrate with your Express app:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { ExpressAdapter } from '@nestjs/platform-express';
import * as express from 'express';
import { INestApplication } from '@nestjs/common';

async function bootstrap(expressInstance: express.Express): Promise<INestApplication> {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(
    AppModule,
    new ExpressAdapter(expressInstance),
  );

  // You can add global NestJS configuration here, e.g., CORS, middleware

  return app;
}

export default bootstrap;
```

Key points:

*   **`ExpressAdapter`:** We use `ExpressAdapter` to tell NestJS to use our existing Express instance.
*   **`bootstrap(expressInstance)`:**  The `bootstrap` function now accepts an Express instance as an argument and returns an `INestApplication`.  This is crucial for integration.
*   **Exporting `bootstrap`:** We export the `bootstrap` function to be used in the Express app.

### Step 3: Modifying Your Express App to Launch NestJS

In your main Express application file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`), import the NestJS bootstrap function and start NestJS:

```javascript
// app.js or server.js (Express)
const express = require('express');
const bootstrap = require('./nest/dist/main').default; // Assuming you've built the NestJS app
// ... other Express setup ...

const app = express();

// Start NestJS
async function startNest() {
  try {
    const nestApp = await bootstrap(app); // Pass the Express instance to NestJS
    await nestApp.init(); // Manually initialize the NestJS application
    console.log('NestJS is running!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error starting NestJS:', error);
  }
}

startNest();

// Your existing Express routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Express app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Important considerations:

*   **`require('./nest/dist/main').default;`**:  Adjust the path to your NestJS `main.js` file after building it.  The `.default` is crucial because TypeScript exports the `bootstrap` function as the default export.
*   **`bootstrap(app)`**:  Pass the Express `app` instance to the NestJS `bootstrap` function. This creates a hybrid application where NestJS runs *within* your Express app.
*   **`await nestApp.init()`**:  NestJS needs to be manually initialized using the `init()` method on the returned `nestApp` instance.
*   **Order matters:** Ensure that the NestJS bootstrap and initialization happen *before* your existing Express routes are defined.

To build your NestJS application:

```bash
cd nest
npm run build
cd ..
```

### Step 4: Replacing Express Routes with NestJS Controllers

Now, the fun begins!  Choose an Express route that you want to migrate.

**Example: Express Route**

Let's say you have this Express route in your `app.js`:

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Fetch user data from a database
  const user = { id: userId, name: 'Example User' };
  res.json(user);
});
```

**Equivalent NestJS Controller**

Create a new controller in your NestJS project (e.g., `nest/src/users/users.controller.ts`):

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Get(':id')
  getUser(@Param('id') id: string) {
    // Fetch user data from a database (you'll likely need to inject a service here)
    const user = { id, name: 'Example User (from NestJS)' };
    return user;
  }
}
```

Key points:

*   **`@Controller('users')`**: Defines the base route for this controller.
*   **`@Get(':id')`**:  Defines a GET route with a parameter `:id`.
*   **`@Param('id') id: string`**:  Extracts the value of the `:id` parameter from the request.
*   **Return Value:**  NestJS automatically serializes the return value to JSON.

You'll also need to create a `users.module.ts` within your `nest/src/users` directory to properly import the controller and then import that module into `app.module.ts`.

```typescript
// nest/src/users/users.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';

@Module({
  controllers: [UsersController],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Then, update `nest/src/app.module.ts`:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { UsersModule } from './users/users.module';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**Step 5: Gradually Removing Express Routes**

Once the NestJS controller is working correctly, remove the corresponding Express route from your `app.js` or `server.js`.

```javascript
// app.js or server.js (Express)
// app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => { // REMOVE THIS ROUTE
//   const userId = req.params.id;
//   const user = { id: userId, name: 'Example User' };
//   res.json(user);
// });
```

Now, requests to `/users/:id` will be handled by the NestJS controller.  Congratulations, you've migrated your first route!

### Step 6:  Refactor Existing Express Logic into NestJS Services

This is where you start reaping the real benefits of NestJS. As you migrate more routes, you'll want to refactor your Express application's business logic into NestJS services.

**Example: Express Logic**

Suppose you have some logic in your Express route that interacts with a database:

```javascript
app.get('/products', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const products = await db.query('SELECT * FROM products');
    res.json(products);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});
```

**NestJS Service**

Create a service in your NestJS project (e.g., `nest/src/products/products.service.ts`):

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Pool } from 'pg'; // Example: using PostgreSQL

@Injectable()
export class ProductsService {
  private readonly pool: Pool;

  constructor() {
    this.pool = new Pool({
      // Your database connection details
      user: 'your_user',
      host: 'localhost',
      database: 'your_database',
      password: 'your_password',
      port: 5432,
    });
  }

  async getProducts(): Promise<any[]> {
    try {
      const result = await this.pool.query('SELECT * FROM products');
      return result.rows;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch products');
    }
  }
}
```

Key points:

*   **`@Injectable()`**: Marks the class as a service that can be injected into other components.
*   **Dependency Injection**: Inject the database connection (in this example, a PostgreSQL connection pool).  NestJS manages the lifecycle of this dependency.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: Use `async/await` for asynchronous database operations.

**NestJS Controller (Updated)**

Update your controller to use the service:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ProductsService } from './products.service';

@Controller('products')
export class ProductsController {
  constructor(private readonly productsService: ProductsService) {}

  @Get()
  async getProducts() {
    return this.productsService.getProducts();
  }
}
```

*   **Constructor Injection**: Inject the `ProductsService` into the controller.
*   **Delegation**: The controller delegates the actual data fetching to the service.

Remember to add the `ProductsService` to the `providers` array in your `ProductsModule`.

### Step 7:  Continuous Refactoring and Migration

Continue this process of:

1.  Choosing an Express route.
2.  Creating a corresponding NestJS controller and service (if needed).
3.  Moving business logic to NestJS services.
4.  Removing the Express route.

As you migrate more routes, your application will gradually become more NestJS-centric, with improved architecture, testability, and maintainability.

## Best Practices for Gradual Migration

*   **Start Small:** Begin with simple, low-risk routes.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Write unit and integration tests for your NestJS controllers and services.
*   **Keep Express and NestJS Separate (Initially):**  Avoid sharing too much code between the two frameworks early on.  Focus on clear boundaries.
*   **Use Environment Variables:**  Manage configuration using environment variables to easily switch between development, testing, and production environments.
*   **Document Your Progress:**  Keep track of which routes have been migrated and any outstanding issues.
*   **Automate Your Build Process:**  Use tools like Webpack or Parcel to automate the build process for both your Express and NestJS applications.  Consider using a monorepo approach with tools like Lerna or Nx for larger projects.
*   **Version Control:**  Use Git to track your changes and facilitate collaboration.
*   **Consider API Gateway:** If your application has multiple microservices, consider using an API Gateway like Kong or Tyk to manage routing and authentication.

## Handling Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are critical aspects of any web application.  You'll need to migrate your existing authentication logic to NestJS.

*   **Passport.js Integration:** NestJS has excellent support for Passport.js, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. You can use Passport.js strategies to authenticate users using various methods (e.g., local authentication, OAuth, JWT).
*   **Guards:** NestJS guards are used to control access to routes based on user roles or permissions. You can create custom guards to implement your application's authorization logic.

## Conclusion

Migrating from Express to NestJS gradually is a practical and effective way to modernize your application without disrupting existing functionality. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can leverage the benefits of NestJS's architecture, TypeScript, and built-in features while minimizing risk and downtime. Remember to start small, test thoroughly, and continuously refactor your code to achieve a successful migration.  Good luck!
