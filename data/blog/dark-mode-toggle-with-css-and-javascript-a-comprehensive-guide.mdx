# Dark Mode Toggle with CSS and JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

Dark mode has become increasingly popular in recent years, offering a more comfortable viewing experience, especially in low-light environments. Implementing a dark mode toggle on your website not only enhances user experience but can also improve accessibility. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to implementing a dark mode toggle using CSS and JavaScript. We'll cover everything from the basic setup to handling user preferences and ensuring a seamless transition between themes.

## Why Implement Dark Mode?

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly consider the benefits of offering a dark mode:

- **Reduced Eye Strain:** Dark mode reduces the amount of blue light emitted from the screen, which can minimize eye strain, particularly when working in dimly lit conditions.
- **Improved Battery Life:** On devices with OLED screens, dark mode can significantly reduce battery consumption as black pixels are essentially turned off.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Many users simply prefer the aesthetics of dark mode and find it more visually appealing. Offering this option allows users to personalize their experience.
- **Accessibility:** For users with certain visual impairments or light sensitivity, dark mode can be a crucial accessibility feature.

## Setting Up the Foundation: HTML Structure

First, let's create the basic HTML structure for our website. We'll need a button to toggle between light and dark modes.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Dark Mode Toggle</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id="theme-toggle">Toggle Dark Mode</button>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <p>This is some content that will change with the theme.</p>
    </div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- We have a simple HTML structure with a `button` element with the ID `theme-toggle`. This button will be responsible for toggling the dark mode.
- A `div` with the class `content` contains the main content of the page. This is where the visual changes will occur when the theme is toggled.
- We link to a `style.css` file (which we'll create next) for our CSS and a `script.js` file (also created later) for our JavaScript logic.

## Defining the CSS Variables

Next, we'll use CSS custom properties (variables) to define the colors for both light and dark themes. This makes it easy to switch between themes by simply updating the variable values.

Create a file named `style.css` and add the following:

```plaintext
/* Default Light Theme */
:root {
  --background-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #000000;
  --button-background-color: #f0f0f0;
  --button-text-color: #000000;
}

/* Dark Theme */
body.dark-mode {
  --background-color: #121212;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --button-background-color: #333333;
  --button-text-color: #ffffff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */
}

.content {
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc; /* Light border for light mode */
}

.dark-mode .content {
  border: 1px solid #555;  /* Darker border for dark mode */
}


#theme-toggle {
  background-color: var(--button-background-color);
  color: var(--button-text-color);
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */
}

#theme-toggle:hover {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We define CSS variables using `:root` for the light theme. These variables store the background color, text color, button background color, and button text color.
- We use `body.dark-mode` to define a set of CSS variables that will override the default light theme variables when the `dark-mode` class is added to the `body` element. This is the key to switching themes.
- We apply the CSS variables using `var(--variable-name)` to the `body` and `#theme-toggle` elements.
- We add a `transition` property to `body` and `#theme-toggle` to create a smooth transition effect when switching between themes.
- We added CSS rules to apply the current theme.

## Adding the JavaScript Logic

Now, let's write the JavaScript code to toggle the `dark-mode` class on the `body` element when the button is clicked. This is where the magic happens. We'll also save the user's preference to `localStorage` so that the theme persists across sessions.

Create a file named `script.js` and add the following:

```javascript
const themeToggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle')
const body = document.body

// Function to set the theme based on localStorage
function setThemeFromLocalStorage() {
  const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme')
  if (theme === 'dark') {
    body.classList.add('dark-mode')
  } else {
    body.classList.remove('dark-mode')
  }
}

// Initial theme setup on page load
setThemeFromLocalStorage()

themeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
  body.classList.toggle('dark-mode')

  // Save the theme preference to localStorage
  if (body.classList.contains('dark-mode')) {
    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')
  } else {
    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We get references to the `theme-toggle` button and the `body` element.
- `setThemeFromLocalStorage()`: This function retrieves the user's theme preference from `localStorage`. If the theme is set to 'dark', it adds the `dark-mode` class to the `body` element; otherwise, it removes the class. This function is called on page load to apply the previously saved theme.
- We add an event listener to the `theme-toggle` button that listens for a click event.
- When the button is clicked, we toggle the `dark-mode` class on the `body` element using `body.classList.toggle('dark-mode')`.
- We save the user's theme preference to `localStorage` using `localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')` or `localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')`. This ensures that the theme persists across sessions.

## Testing the Implementation

Now, open the `index.html` file in your browser. You should see a button that says "Toggle Dark Mode". When you click the button, the theme should switch between light and dark. Refresh the page, and the theme should persist.

## Accessibility Considerations

While our implementation works, we need to consider accessibility to ensure that our dark mode toggle is usable by everyone, including users with disabilities.

- **Sufficient Contrast:** Ensure that the contrast between the text and background colors is sufficient for both light and dark themes. Use tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify contrast ratios.
- **Keyboard Accessibility:** Make sure the toggle button is focusable and operable using the keyboard. Our current implementation is already keyboard accessible as it's a standard `<button>` element. However, if you use custom elements, you'll need to handle keyboard navigation yourself using `tabindex` and JavaScript.
- **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes to provide additional information about the toggle button to assistive technologies. For example:

  ```html
  <button id="theme-toggle" aria-pressed="false">Toggle Dark Mode</button>
  ```

  And update the JavaScript to toggle the `aria-pressed` attribute:

  ```javascript
  themeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    body.classList.toggle('dark-mode')

    // Update aria-pressed attribute
    const isDarkMode = body.classList.contains('dark-mode')
    themeToggle.setAttribute('aria-pressed', isDarkMode)

    // Save the theme preference to localStorage
    if (isDarkMode) {
      localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')
    } else {
      localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')
    }
  })
  ```

- **User Preferences:** Respect the user's system-level theme preference (e.g., dark mode setting in the operating system). We can use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query in CSS to detect the user's preference.

## Respecting System Preferences with `prefers-color-scheme`

The `prefers-color-scheme` media query allows you to detect if the user has requested the system to use a light or dark color theme. Let's incorporate this into our CSS:

```plaintext
/* Default Light Theme */
:root {
  --background-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #000000;
  --button-background-color: #f0f0f0;
  --button-text-color: #000000;
}

/* Dark Theme - Applied by default if system prefers dark mode */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    :root {
      --background-color: #121212;
      --text-color: #ffffff;
      --button-background-color: #333333;
      --button-text-color: #ffffff;
    }
}

/* Dark Theme - Applied when the dark-mode class is present */
body.dark-mode {
  --background-color: #121212;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --button-background-color: #333333;
  --button-text-color: #ffffff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */
}

.content {
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc; /* Light border for light mode */
}

.dark-mode .content {
  border: 1px solid #555;  /* Darker border for dark mode */
}


#theme-toggle {
  background-color: var(--button-background-color);
  color: var(--button-text-color);
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */
}

#theme-toggle:hover {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```

Now, if the user's system is set to dark mode, the website will automatically load in dark mode without them having to click the toggle. However, the toggle will still allow them to override the system preference.

To ensure our javascript plays nicely with `prefers-color-scheme` we will modify our `setThemeFromLocalStorage` function to take into account if there is no localStorage value yet.

```javascript
const themeToggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle')
const body = document.body

// Function to set the theme based on localStorage
function setThemeFromLocalStorage() {
  const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme')

  // Check if there's a stored theme
  if (theme) {
    if (theme === 'dark') {
      body.classList.add('dark-mode')
    } else {
      body.classList.remove('dark-mode')
    }
  } else {
    // If no stored theme, respect prefers-color-scheme
    if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
      body.classList.add('dark-mode')
      localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark') // Store preference
    } else {
      body.classList.remove('dark-mode')
      localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light') // Store preference
    }
  }
}

// Initial theme setup on page load
setThemeFromLocalStorage()

themeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
  body.classList.toggle('dark-mode')

  // Update aria-pressed attribute
  const isDarkMode = body.classList.contains('dark-mode')
  themeToggle.setAttribute('aria-pressed', isDarkMode)

  // Save the theme preference to localStorage
  if (body.classList.contains('dark-mode')) {
    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')
  } else {
    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')
  }
})
```

## More Advanced Techniques and Considerations

- **CSS Filters:** You can use CSS filters like `invert` and `hue-rotate` to create a dark mode effect. However, this approach can sometimes lead to unexpected results and is not always the best option.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** If you are using a framework like Next.js or Gatsby, you'll need to consider how to handle dark mode during server-side rendering. You can use libraries like `next-themes` or `gatsby-plugin-dark-mode` to simplify this process.
- **Component Libraries:** Many UI component libraries (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design) have built-in support for dark mode. Leveraging these libraries can save you time and effort.
- **Theme Switching without Page Reloads:** The code provided uses CSS variables to efficiently swap between themes without requiring page reloads. This is generally preferred for a smoother user experience.

## Conclusion

Implementing a dark mode toggle on your website is a valuable way to improve user experience and accessibility. By using CSS variables, JavaScript, and `localStorage`, you can create a seamless and persistent dark mode experience for your users. Remember to consider accessibility throughout the process to ensure that your website is usable by everyone. This comprehensive guide provides a solid foundation for building a robust and user-friendly dark mode toggle. Remember to continuously test and refine your implementation to ensure optimal performance and accessibility.
