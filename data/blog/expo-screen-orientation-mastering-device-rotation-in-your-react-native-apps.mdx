# Expo Screen Orientation: Mastering Device Rotation in Your React Native Apps

Creating mobile applications that adapt seamlessly to different screen orientations is crucial for providing a polished and user-friendly experience. Whether you want to lock your app to portrait mode, enable landscape mode for specific screens, or dynamically adjust the UI based on the current orientation, the `expo-screen-orientation` library offers a powerful and convenient solution for your React Native Expo projects.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively manage screen orientation in your Expo apps. We'll cover installation, basic usage, advanced techniques, and best practices for ensuring your app looks great in any orientation.

## What is `expo-screen-orientation`?

`expo-screen-orientation` is an Expo module that provides APIs for controlling and querying the device's screen orientation. It allows you to:

- **Lock the screen orientation:** Force the app to stay in a specific orientation (portrait, landscape, etc.).
- **Unlock the screen orientation:** Allow the device's default orientation behavior.
- **Get the current orientation:** Determine the current orientation of the device.
- **Listen for orientation changes:** React to changes in screen orientation in real-time.

## Why Use `expo-screen-orientation`?

Managing screen orientation manually can be complex and platform-specific. `expo-screen-orientation` simplifies the process by providing a unified API that works across both iOS and Android, saving you time and effort. It also integrates seamlessly with the Expo ecosystem, making it easy to use in your existing Expo projects.

## Installation

First, install the `expo-screen-orientation` package using `expo install`:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-screen-orientation
```

This command will automatically install the package and configure it for your Expo project.

## Basic Usage: Locking Screen Orientation

One of the most common use cases for `expo-screen-orientation` is to lock the app to a specific orientation. This can be useful for apps that are designed to be used in a particular orientation, such as games or media players.

Here's an example of how to lock the screen orientation to portrait mode:

```plaintext
import * as ScreenOrientation from 'expo-screen-orientation'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

async function changeScreenOrientation() {
  await ScreenOrientation.lockAsync(ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock.PORTRAIT_UP)
}

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    changeScreenOrientation()
  }, [])

  return (
    // Your app's UI here
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>This app is locked in portrait mode.</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `ScreenOrientation` module.
- We define an asynchronous function `changeScreenOrientation` to lock the screen orientation. Using `async/await` is essential as the locking operation is asynchronous.
- `ScreenOrientation.lockAsync()` is used to lock the screen orientation.
- `ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock.PORTRAIT_UP` specifies that we want to lock the screen in the portrait-up orientation. Other options include:
  - `PORTRAIT_DOWN`
  - `LANDSCAPE_LEFT`
  - `LANDSCAPE_RIGHT`
  - `PORTRAIT` (either `PORTRAIT_UP` or `PORTRAIT_DOWN`)
  - `LANDSCAPE` (either `LANDSCAPE_LEFT` or `LANDSCAPE_RIGHT`)
  - `ALL` (all orientations allowed)
  - `ALL_BUT_UPSIDE_DOWN` (all orientations except upside down portrait)
- We use the `useEffect` hook to call `changeScreenOrientation` when the component mounts. This ensures that the screen orientation is locked as soon as the app starts.

## Unlocking Screen Orientation

To allow the device to rotate freely based on the user's device orientation, you can unlock the screen orientation:

```plaintext
import * as ScreenOrientation from 'expo-screen-orientation'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

async function allowRotation() {
  await ScreenOrientation.unlockAsync()
}

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    allowRotation()
  }, [])

  return (
    // Your app's UI here
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>This app allows screen rotation.</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We use `ScreenOrientation.unlockAsync()` to unlock the screen orientation. This restores the device's default orientation behavior.

## Detecting Screen Orientation Changes

Sometimes, you need to know when the screen orientation changes so you can update your app's UI accordingly. The `expo-screen-orientation` library provides a way to listen for orientation changes using the `ScreenOrientation.addOrientationChangeListener` function.

```plaintext
import * as ScreenOrientation from 'expo-screen-orientation'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [orientation, setOrientation] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getOrientation() {
      const { orientation } = await ScreenOrientation.getOrientationAsync()
      setOrientation(orientation)
    }

    getOrientation()

    const subscription = ScreenOrientation.addOrientationChangeListener((result) => {
      setOrientation(result.orientationInfo.orientation)
    })

    return () => {
      ScreenOrientation.removeOrientationChangeListener(subscription)
    }
  }, [])

  const orientationString =
    orientation === ScreenOrientation.Orientation.PORTRAIT
      ? 'Portrait'
      : orientation === ScreenOrientation.Orientation.LANDSCAPE_LEFT
        ? 'Landscape Left'
        : orientation === ScreenOrientation.Orientation.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT
          ? 'Landscape Right'
          : orientation === ScreenOrientation.Orientation.PORTRAIT_UPSIDE_DOWN
            ? 'Portrait Upside Down'
            : 'Unknown'

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Current Orientation: {orientationString}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- We initialize a state variable `orientation` to store the current orientation.
- In the `useEffect` hook:
  - We call `ScreenOrientation.getOrientationAsync()` to get the initial orientation and set the `orientation` state.
  - We use `ScreenOrientation.addOrientationChangeListener()` to listen for orientation changes. This function returns a subscription object.
  - The callback function provided to `addOrientationChangeListener` receives an object containing information about the new orientation. We extract the `orientation` value and update the `orientation` state.
  - We return a cleanup function that removes the orientation change listener when the component unmounts using `ScreenOrientation.removeOrientationChangeListener()`. This is essential to prevent memory leaks.
- We display the current orientation in the UI.

## Advanced Techniques: Conditional Orientation Locking

You might want to allow rotation in some parts of your app while locking it in others. For example, you might want to lock a video player to landscape mode but allow the rest of the app to rotate freely.

Here's an example of how to conditionally lock the screen orientation based on the currently displayed screen:

```plaintext
import * as ScreenOrientation from 'expo-screen-orientation'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [isLandscape, setIsLandscape] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function updateOrientation() {
      if (isLandscape) {
        await ScreenOrientation.lockAsync(ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock.LANDSCAPE)
      } else {
        await ScreenOrientation.unlockAsync()
      }
    }

    updateOrientation()
  }, [isLandscape])

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Button
        title={isLandscape ? 'Disable Landscape' : 'Enable Landscape'}
        onPress={() => setIsLandscape(!isLandscape)}
      />
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We introduce a state variable `isLandscape` to track whether the app should be locked in landscape mode.
- In the `useEffect` hook, we check the value of `isLandscape` and lock or unlock the screen orientation accordingly.
- We use a button to toggle the value of `isLandscape`. When the button is pressed, the `isLandscape` state is updated, which triggers the `useEffect` hook and locks or unlocks the screen orientation.

## Best Practices

- **Use `async/await`:** All of the `ScreenOrientation` APIs that lock or unlock the screen are asynchronous. Always use `async/await` when calling these functions to ensure that the operations complete successfully.
- **Clean up listeners:** Always remove orientation change listeners when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.
- **Consider the user experience:** Think about how screen orientation affects the user experience of your app. Locking the screen orientation can be useful in some cases, but it can also be frustrating for users if they are not able to use your app in their preferred orientation.
- **Test thoroughly:** Test your app in both portrait and landscape mode on different devices to ensure that it looks and works correctly in all orientations.
- **Use Typescript**: Leveraging Typescript with `expo-screen-orientation` provides type safety and enhances code maintainability. For example:

  ```plaintext
  import * as ScreenOrientation from 'expo-screen-orientation';
  import { useEffect } from 'react';

  async function lockToPortrait(): Promise<void> {
      try {
          await ScreenOrientation.lockAsync(ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock.PORTRAIT_UP);
      } catch (error) {
          console.error("Failed to lock screen orientation:", error);
      }
  }

  const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
      useEffect(() => {
          lockToPortrait();
          return () => {
              // Optional: Unlock on unmount if necessary
              ScreenOrientation.unlockAsync().catch(err => console.error("Failed to unlock", err));
          };
      }, []);

      return (
          <View>
              <Text>Component locked to Portrait</Text>
          </View>
      );
  };
  ```

## Conclusion

The `expo-screen-orientation` library is a powerful tool for managing screen orientation in your React Native Expo applications. By using the techniques described in this guide, you can create apps that are both responsive and user-friendly, regardless of the device's orientation. Remember to consider the user experience and test thoroughly to ensure your app looks great in any orientation.
