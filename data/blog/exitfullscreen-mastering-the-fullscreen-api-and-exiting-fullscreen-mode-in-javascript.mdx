# exitFullscreen(): Mastering the Fullscreen API and Exiting Fullscreen Mode in JavaScript

The Fullscreen API is a powerful tool that allows web developers to programmatically take a website or specific elements within a webpage into fullscreen mode. This can significantly enhance the user experience, especially for media-rich content like videos, games, or interactive dashboards.  However, equally important as entering fullscreen is knowing how to gracefully *exit* it.  This blog post delves deep into the `exitFullscreen()` method, equipping you with the knowledge to seamlessly manage fullscreen behavior on your websites.

## What is the Fullscreen API?

Before we dive into `exitFullscreen()`, let's briefly recap the Fullscreen API.  It's a web API that provides developers with the ability to request that the browser display a specific element in fullscreen mode, occupying the entire screen. This is particularly useful for:

*   **Video playback:** Offering a dedicated, immersive viewing experience.
*   **Gaming:** Maximizing screen real estate for enhanced gameplay.
*   **Presentations:** Eliminating distractions and focusing on the content.
*   **Data Visualization:** Providing a clear and uncluttered view of complex data.

## Understanding `exitFullscreen()`

The `exitFullscreen()` method, also known as `document.exitFullscreen()`, `document.webkitExitFullscreen()`, `document.mozCancelFullScreen()`, `document.msExitFullscreen()`, is the core function for exiting fullscreen mode.  It's a property of the `document` object and instructs the browser to return from fullscreen mode to the normal windowed mode.  The exact method name you use depends on the browser, due to historical vendor prefixes.

**Key Points:**

*   `exitFullscreen()` does *not* take any arguments.
*   It's a *document* method, meaning it operates on the entire document, not a specific element.
*   The browser handles the transition back to normal mode, providing a smooth user experience.
*   It returns a `Promise` which resolves when the exit is successful or rejects if it fails (in modern browsers).

## Cross-Browser Compatibility: The Vendor Prefix Challenge

Historically, different browsers implemented the Fullscreen API with different vendor prefixes.  This meant you needed to check which browser the user was using and use the corresponding prefixed method. While modern browsers largely support the unprefixed `document.exitFullscreen()`, it's still good practice to include checks for prefixed versions to ensure maximum compatibility with older browsers.

Here's how to handle cross-browser compatibility:

```javascript
function exitFullscreen() {
  if (document.exitFullscreen) {
    document.exitFullscreen();
  } else if (document.webkitExitFullscreen) { /* Safari */
    document.webkitExitFullscreen();
  } else if (document.mozCancelFullScreen) { /* Firefox */
    document.mozCancelFullScreen();
  } else if (document.msExitFullscreen) { /* IE11 */
    document.msExitFullscreen();
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

This function checks for the existence of each prefixed version of `exitFullscreen()` and executes the appropriate one.  This covers the major browsers, including:

*   **Chrome, Safari, Edge:** `document.exitFullscreen()` and `document.webkitExitFullscreen()` (Safari is the primary reason for including the `webkit` prefix).
*   **Firefox:** `document.mozCancelFullScreen()`
*   **Internet Explorer 11:** `document.msExitFullscreen()`

## Implementing `exitFullscreen()`: A Practical Example

Let's illustrate how to use `exitFullscreen()` within a real-world scenario.  Consider a simple video player with a fullscreen toggle button.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Fullscreen API Example</title>
  <style>
    #videoContainer {
      width: 640px;
      height: 360px;
      background-color: #eee;
      position: relative;
    }

    #videoPlayer {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
    }

    #fullscreenButton {
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 10px;
      right: 10px;
      padding: 5px 10px;
      background-color: #3498db;
      color: white;
      border: none;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <div id="videoContainer">
    <video id="videoPlayer" src="your-video.mp4" controls></video>
    <button id="fullscreenButton">Fullscreen</button>
  </div>

  <script>
    const videoContainer = document.getElementById('videoContainer');
    const videoPlayer = document.getElementById('videoPlayer');
    const fullscreenButton = document.getElementById('fullscreenButton');

    function toggleFullscreen() {
      if (isFullscreen()) {
        exitFullscreen();
        fullscreenButton.textContent = 'Fullscreen';
      } else {
        requestFullscreen(videoContainer);
        fullscreenButton.textContent = 'Exit Fullscreen';
      }
    }

    function requestFullscreen(element) {
      if (element.requestFullscreen) {
        element.requestFullscreen();
      } else if (element.webkitRequestFullscreen) { /* Safari */
        element.webkitRequestFullscreen();
      } else if (element.mozRequestFullScreen) { /* Firefox */
        element.mozRequestFullScreen();
      } else if (element.msRequestFullscreen) { /* IE11 */
        element.msRequestFullscreen();
      }
    }

    function exitFullscreen() {
      if (document.exitFullscreen) {
        document.exitFullscreen();
      } else if (document.webkitExitFullscreen) { /* Safari */
        document.webkitExitFullscreen();
      } else if (document.mozCancelFullScreen) { /* Firefox */
        document.mozCancelFullScreen();
      } else if (document.msExitFullscreen) { /* IE11 */
        document.msExitFullscreen();
      }
    }

    function isFullscreen() {
      return !!(document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement || document.mozFullScreenElement || document.msFullscreenElement);
    }

    fullscreenButton.addEventListener('click', toggleFullscreen);

    // Listen for fullscreen change events to update the button text
    document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', updateButtonText);
    document.addEventListener('webkitfullscreenchange', updateButtonText);
    document.addEventListener('mozfullscreenchange', updateButtonText);
    document.addEventListener('msfullscreenchange', updateButtonText);

    function updateButtonText() {
        if (isFullscreen()) {
            fullscreenButton.textContent = 'Exit Fullscreen';
        } else {
            fullscreenButton.textContent = 'Fullscreen';
        }
    }

  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **HTML Structure:** We have a video container (`videoContainer`) holding the video player (`videoPlayer`) and a fullscreen button (`fullscreenButton`).

2.  **JavaScript Logic:**
    *   `toggleFullscreen()`: This function determines whether the page is currently in fullscreen mode using the `isFullscreen()` function and calls either `requestFullscreen()` or `exitFullscreen()` accordingly.  It also updates the button's text.
    *   `requestFullscreen(element)`:  This function handles the logic for *entering* fullscreen mode, similar to `exitFullscreen()`, accounting for vendor prefixes.
    *   `exitFullscreen()`:  The function we've been discussing, responsible for exiting fullscreen mode, handles browser compatibility with vendor prefixes.
    *   `isFullscreen()`: This helper function checks the various browser-specific properties to determine if the document is currently in fullscreen mode.
    *   `updateButtonText()`: This function is called when the fullscreen state changes to keep the button text in sync.
    *   **Event Listeners:**  The `fullscreenButton` has a click listener to toggle fullscreen, and event listeners are added to the `document` to detect when the fullscreen state changes due to user actions (e.g., pressing the Esc key). These event listeners are crucial for updating the button text.

## Detecting Fullscreen State:  `document.fullscreenElement`

The `document.fullscreenElement` property provides a reliable way to determine if any element on the page is currently in fullscreen mode. It returns the element that is in fullscreen mode, or `null` if no element is in fullscreen.  This is another important tool for maintaining accurate UI state.  Note the need for vendor prefixes here as well, as shown in the `isFullscreen()` function above.

## Handling Fullscreen Events

It's often necessary to respond to changes in the fullscreen state.  The Fullscreen API provides events that are fired when the page enters or exits fullscreen mode:

*   `fullscreenchange`: Fired when the document enters or exits fullscreen mode. (Standard)
*   `webkitfullscreenchange`: Fired when the document enters or exits fullscreen mode. (Webkit Browsers)
*   `mozfullscreenchange`: Fired when the document enters or exits fullscreen mode. (Firefox)
*   `msfullscreenchange`: Fired when the document enters or exits fullscreen mode. (IE)

These events allow you to:

*   Update the UI (e.g., change button labels, adjust layout).
*   Pause or resume video playback.
*   Adjust game rendering settings.

In the example above, we listen for these events to update the button text (`updateButtonText` function).  This ensures that the button text accurately reflects the current fullscreen state, even if the user exits fullscreen using the Esc key or the browser's native fullscreen controls.

## Security Considerations

The Fullscreen API has security implications. Browsers typically require user interaction (e.g., a button click) before allowing a website to enter fullscreen mode. This prevents malicious websites from taking over the user's screen without their consent. Attempting to enter fullscreen without user interaction will generally be blocked by the browser.  No special permissions are required to *exit* fullscreen, which reinforces user control.

## Promises and Asynchronous Behavior

Modern browsers use Promises with `requestFullscreen()` and `exitFullscreen()`. This allows you to handle the success or failure of the fullscreen transition using `then()` and `catch()` blocks.

```javascript
function toggleFullscreen() {
    if (isFullscreen()) {
        exitFullscreen()
            .then(() => {
                console.log("Exited fullscreen successfully");
                fullscreenButton.textContent = 'Fullscreen';
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                console.error("Failed to exit fullscreen:", error);
            });
    } else {
        requestFullscreen(videoContainer)
            .then(() => {
                console.log("Entered fullscreen successfully");
                fullscreenButton.textContent = 'Exit Fullscreen';
            })
            .catch((error) => {
                console.error("Failed to enter fullscreen:", error);
            });
    }
}

function exitFullscreen() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const exitFullscreenFunc =
            document.exitFullscreen ||
            document.webkitExitFullscreen ||
            document.mozCancelFullScreen ||
            document.msExitFullscreen;

        if (exitFullscreenFunc) {
            exitFullscreenFunc.call(document)
                .then(resolve)
                .catch(reject);
        } else {
            reject(new Error("Fullscreen API not supported."));
        }
    });
}

function requestFullscreen(element) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const requestFullscreenFunc =
            element.requestFullscreen ||
            element.webkitRequestFullscreen ||
            element.mozRequestFullScreen ||
            element.msRequestFullscreen;

        if (requestFullscreenFunc) {
            requestFullscreenFunc.call(element)
                .then(resolve)
                .catch(reject);
        } else {
            reject(new Error("Fullscreen API not supported."));
        }
    });
}

```

This demonstrates how to wrap the prefixed functions within Promises for cleaner asynchronous handling. The `exitFullscreen()` and `requestFullscreen()` functions now return Promises that resolve or reject based on the success of the fullscreen transition. The `toggleFullscreen()` function then handles these promises with `.then()` and `.catch()` to log messages and update the button text. This approach offers more robust error handling and aligns with modern JavaScript practices.

## Best Practices for `exitFullscreen()`

*   **Provide a clear exit mechanism:**  Offer a prominent button or control for users to easily exit fullscreen mode. Relying solely on the Esc key can be frustrating for users.
*   **Handle events gracefully:**  Listen for `fullscreenchange` events to update your UI and adjust your application's behavior accordingly.
*   **Consider accessibility:** Ensure that your fullscreen experience is accessible to users with disabilities. Use appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
*   **Test thoroughly:**  Test your fullscreen implementation across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience.
*   **Use Promises:** Leverage promises for a more robust error handling and asynchronous management.
