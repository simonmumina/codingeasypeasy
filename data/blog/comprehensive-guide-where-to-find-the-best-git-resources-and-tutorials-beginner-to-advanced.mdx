### Example: Basic Git Commands

Here's a quick example of some basic Git commands:

```plaintext
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add files to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create a new branch
git branch my-feature

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout my-feature

# Make changes to your files

# Add and commit the changes on the new branch
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented feature X"

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the changes from the feature branch
git merge my-feature

# Push the changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub)
git push origin main
```

## Git Resources for Intermediate Developers

Once you have a good grasp of the basics, these resources can help you deepen your knowledge and master more advanced Git techniques:

### 1. Pro Git Book

- **Link:** [https://git-scm.com/book](https://git-scm.com/book)

Pro Git is a comprehensive guide to Git that covers advanced topics like rebasing, branching strategies, and Git internals. It's a great resource for developers who want to understand Git at a deeper level. This book is the same as the Git Handbook above but contains more advanced content.

**Key Features:**

- In-depth coverage of Git concepts and commands.
- Detailed explanations of Git internals.
- Suitable for developers with some Git experience.

### 2. Advanced Git Tutorials on Atlassian

- **Link:** Again, the main Atlassian Git Tutorial page: [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)

Atlassian's tutorials also offer advanced content focusing on topics such as interactive staging, git hooks, and advanced branching strategies. Look for the sections designated as "Advanced."

**Key Features:**

- Practical use cases for advanced Git commands.
- Clear explanations of complex concepts.
- Integration with Bitbucket workflows.

### 3. Git Workflows

- **Search Terms:** "Gitflow Workflow", "GitHub Flow", "GitLab Flow"

Understanding different Git workflows is crucial for effective collaboration. Research popular workflows like Gitflow, GitHub Flow, and GitLab Flow to determine which one best suits your team's needs.

**Key Features:**

- Structured approach to collaboration and version control.
- Defines how branches should be used and merged.
- Helps manage releases and hotfixes.

### 4. Git Rebase Tutorial

- **Link:** [Numerous tutorials are available, search "Git Rebase Tutorial" on your preferred search engine]

Rebasing is a powerful Git technique that allows you to rewrite the commit history. While powerful, it requires careful usage. Understanding when and how to use rebase effectively is a valuable skill.

**Example:**

```plaintext
# Assuming you're on a feature branch 'my-feature'
git checkout my-feature

# Fetch the latest changes from the main branch
git fetch origin main

# Rebase your feature branch on top of the main branch
git rebase origin/main
```

This will replay the commits on your `my-feature` branch on top of the latest `main` branch. You might encounter conflicts during the rebase, which you'll need to resolve.

### 5. Git Interactive Staging (git add -p)

- **Search Terms:** "Git Interactive Staging" or "git add -p"

Interactive staging allows you to selectively stage parts of a file. This is extremely useful for cleaning up your commits and making them more focused.

**Example:**

```plaintext
# Use interactive staging
git add -p <filename>
```

This command will walk you through each change in the file and ask you whether you want to stage it or not.

## Git Resources for Advanced Users

For experienced Git users who want to push their skills to the limit, these resources offer in-depth knowledge and advanced techniques:

### 1. Git Internals

- **Search Terms:** "Git Internals", "Git Object Model"

Understanding how Git stores data internally can help you troubleshoot issues and optimize your Git workflow. Explore the Git object model, including blobs, trees, and commits.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Blobs:** Store the content of files.
- **Trees:** Represent directories and file hierarchy.
- **Commits:** Point to a tree and store metadata like author and commit message.

### 2. Custom Git Hooks

- **Search Terms:** "Git Hooks"

Git hooks allow you to execute custom scripts at various points in the Git workflow, such as before a commit or after a push. You can use hooks to automate tasks, enforce coding standards, and prevent errors.

**Example:** A pre-commit hook to check for syntax errors:

```plaintext
#!/bin/sh

# Check for syntax errors in JavaScript files
for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRTUXB | grep '\.js$')
do
  echo "Checking syntax of $file..."
  if ! javascript-linter "$file" ; then
    echo "Syntax errors found.  Aborting commit."
    exit 1
  fi
done

exit 0
```

This script would be saved in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and made executable (`chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`). Remember hooks are local to the repository and are not shared automatically.

### 3. Git Submodules and Subtrees

- **Search Terms:** "Git Submodules", "Git Subtrees"

Submodules and subtrees allow you to include other Git repositories as part of your main repository. They are useful for managing dependencies and reusing code across projects.

**Key Differences:**

- **Submodules:** Point to a specific commit in the external repository. Requires manual updates.
- **Subtrees:** Merge the external repository into your project's history. More flexible but can be more complex.

### 4. Brave New Geek Blog
