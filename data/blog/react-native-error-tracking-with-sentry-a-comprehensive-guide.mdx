# React Native Error Tracking with Sentry: A Comprehensive Guide

Ensuring your React Native application is stable and provides a seamless user experience is crucial. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by implementing robust error tracking. This guide will walk you through using Sentry, a powerful error tracking platform, to monitor and fix errors in your React Native apps. We'll cover everything from initial setup to advanced configuration, helping you proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact your users.

## Why Use Sentry for React Native Error Tracking?

Sentry offers several benefits for React Native development:

- **Real-time Error Monitoring:** Get instant alerts when errors occur in production.
- **Detailed Error Context:** Sentry captures valuable information about errors, including stack traces, user data, device information, and more, making debugging significantly easier.
- **Performance Monitoring (Optional):** Beyond error tracking, Sentry can also monitor your application's performance, helping you identify slow transactions and optimize performance.
- **User Feedback:** Integrate user feedback mechanisms to gather more context about encountered errors.
- **Integrations:** Sentry integrates seamlessly with various development tools, including GitHub, Jira, and Slack, streamlining your workflow.

## Setting Up Sentry in Your React Native Project

Let's get started with the setup. This guide assumes you already have a Sentry account. If not, sign up for a free account at [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

### 1. Install the Sentry React Native SDK

First, install the necessary Sentry packages in your React Native project using npm or Yarn:

```plaintext
npm install @sentry/react-native @sentry/react-native-compat

# or

yarn add @sentry/react-native @sentry/react-native-compat
```

`@sentry/react-native` is the core Sentry SDK for React Native, and `@sentry/react-native-compat` is needed for compatibility with older React Native versions that might not fully support the native Sentry integration. If you're on a newer React Native version you might not need `@sentry/react-native-compat` depending on your specific configuration. Check Sentry's official documentation for the latest recommendations.

### 2. Configure Sentry in Your Application

Next, initialize Sentry in your application's entry point (usually `index.js` or `App.js`).

```javascript
// index.js or App.js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'
import App from './App'
import { name as appName } from './app.json'

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN', // Replace with your Sentry DSN
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactNavigationV5Instrumentation, // or V6 depending on your version
    }),
  ],
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2, // Capture 20% of transactions (adjust as needed)
})

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App)
```

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_SENTRY_DSN` with your actual Sentry DSN (Data Source Name). You can find this in your Sentry project settings under "Client Keys (DSN)".

**Explanation:**

- `Sentry.init()` initializes the Sentry SDK.
- `dsn`: Your Sentry DSN. This is the unique identifier for your Sentry project, allowing the SDK to send error data to your Sentry account.
- `integrations`: This array allows you to configure various integrations with Sentry. In this example, we are using `ReactNativeTracing` which enables distributed tracing to capture performance data and provide insights into user interactions and transactions.
  - `routingInstrumentation`: This configures automatic instrumentation of navigation events within your app. This is crucial for performance monitoring within react navigation.
- `tracesSampleRate`: A value between 0 and 1 that determines the percentage of transactions that will be sampled and sent to Sentry for performance monitoring. Setting this to 1.0 captures all transactions, but can generate a significant amount of data. We recommend starting with a lower value like 0.2 and adjusting as needed.

### 3. Navigation Instrumentation (React Navigation)

If you are using React Navigation, you'll want to install the React Navigation integration within Sentry. The example above uses `Sentry.reactNavigationV5Instrumentation`. If you are using React Navigation v6 or above, change that to `Sentry.reactNavigationV6Instrumentation`. You may also need to install the dependency:

```plaintext
npm install @sentry/react-navigation

# or

yarn add @sentry/react-navigation
```

Then, ensure that your navigator is wrapped with the `useRoute` hook:

```jsx
import { useRoute } from '@react-navigation/native'
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack'
import React from 'react'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

function HomeScreen() {
  return <Text>Home Screen</Text>
}

function DetailsScreen() {
  const route = useRoute()
  return <Text>Details Screen - {route.name}</Text>
}

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator()

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}

export default App
```

This ensures that Sentry can track navigation events and provide accurate performance insights within your app's navigation flow.

### 4. Wrap Your Root Component

To ensure that all errors within your application are caught by Sentry, wrap your root component (the one passed to `AppRegistry.registerComponent`) with the `Sentry.wrap()` function.

```javascript
// index.js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'
import App from './App'
import { name as appName } from './app.json'

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactNavigationV5Instrumentation,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2,
})

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => Sentry.wrap(App))
```

This wraps your main application component with a higher-order component provided by Sentry, allowing it to catch and report any unhandled exceptions that occur within the component tree.

## Capturing Errors and Exceptions

Now that Sentry is set up, let's explore how to capture different types of errors.

### 1. Handling Unhandled Exceptions

Sentry automatically captures unhandled exceptions, meaning errors that are not caught by `try...catch` blocks. This is a fundamental feature that ensures that critical errors are reported even if you haven't explicitly handled them.

### 2. Using `try...catch` Blocks

For errors that you anticipate and want to handle gracefully, use `try...catch` blocks. You can then use `Sentry.captureException()` or `Sentry.captureMessage()` to report these errors to Sentry along with additional context.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = Math.random() > 0.5
      if (success) {
        resolve('Data fetched successfully!')
      } else {
        reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data.'))
      }
    }, 1000)
  })
}

async function MyComponent() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData()
    console.log(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error)
    Sentry.captureException(error) // Report the error to Sentry
  }
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- The `try...catch` block allows you to handle potential errors during the `fetchData` function call.
- If an error occurs, `Sentry.captureException(error)` sends the error object to Sentry. This includes the stack trace and other relevant information.

### 3. Capturing Messages

You can also use `Sentry.captureMessage()` to send custom messages to Sentry. This can be useful for logging specific events or states in your application.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

function handleClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked!')
  Sentry.captureMessage('User clicked the button.')
}

// Inside your component's render method
;<Button title="Click Me" onPress={handleClick} />
```

**Explanation:**

- `Sentry.captureMessage('User clicked the button.')` sends a custom message to Sentry whenever the button is clicked.

### 4. Setting User Context

Providing user context to Sentry is crucial for understanding the impact of errors on specific users. You can set user information such as ID, email, and username.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

function login(userId, email) {
  // ... your login logic ...

  Sentry.setUser({
    id: userId,
    email: email,
    username: 'User' + userId,
  })
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `Sentry.setUser()` sets the user context. The `id` is the unique identifier for the user, and `email` and `username` provide additional information.

### 5. Adding Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are records of events that occurred before an error. They provide valuable context for understanding the user's actions leading up to the error.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

function handleApiCall(url) {
  Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
    category: 'api',
    message: `Making API call to ${url}`,
    level: Sentry.Severity.Info,
  })

  // ... your API call logic ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `Sentry.addBreadcrumb()` adds a breadcrumb.
- `category`: The category of the event (e.g., 'api', 'navigation').
- `message`: A descriptive message about the event.
- `level`: The severity level of the event (e.g., `Sentry.Severity.Info`, `Sentry.Severity.Warning`).

### 6. Using try catch on `useEffect` hooks

It's common to use `useEffect` hooks to perform side effects. You should use `try catch` blocks on them to capture errors.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      // Your side effect code that might throw an error
      throw new Error('Error in useEffect')
    } catch (error) {
      Sentry.captureException(error)
    }
  }, [])

  return <div>My Component</div>
}

export default MyComponent
```

## Best Practices for React Native Error Tracking with Sentry

Here are some best practices to follow for effective error tracking in your React Native applications:

- **Use a Unique DSN for Each Environment:** Use separate DSNs for your development, staging, and production environments to avoid mixing error data. This will help to isolate issues.
- **Configure Release Tracking:** Set the `release` option in `Sentry.init()` to track which version of your application is running. This allows you to identify which version introduced specific errors. Consider integrating with your CI/CD pipeline to automatically update the release version.
- **Use Source Maps:** Upload source maps to Sentry to deobfuscate stack traces in production builds. This makes it much easier to identify the exact location of errors in your source code. Sentry provides tools and integrations to automate this process.
- **Filter Sensitive Data:** Be careful not to send sensitive data to Sentry. You can use the `beforeSend` option in `Sentry.init()` to filter out sensitive information before it is sent.
- **Monitor Performance:** In addition to error tracking, use Sentry's performance monitoring features to identify slow transactions and optimize your application's performance.
- **Set up Alerts:** Configure Sentry alerts to be notified when critical errors occur. You can set up alerts via email, Slack, or other channels.
- **Regularly Review Errors:** Make it a habit to regularly review the errors reported in Sentry and prioritize fixing the most critical ones.
- **Test Your Sentry Integration:** Before deploying to production, test your Sentry integration by intentionally triggering errors and verifying that they are reported correctly.

## Advanced Configuration

Sentry offers several advanced configuration options to customize your error tracking setup.

### 1. The `beforeSend` Hook

The `beforeSend` hook allows you to modify or discard events before they are sent to Sentry. This is useful for filtering sensitive data or excluding certain types of errors.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactNavigationV5Instrumentation,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2,
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Filter out errors from specific URLs
    if (event.request && event.request.url && event.request.url.includes('example.com')) {
      return null // Discard the event
    }

    return event // Send the event
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- The `beforeSend` function receives the event object as an argument.
- You can modify the event object or return `null` to discard the event.

### 2. The `sampleRate` Option

The `sampleRate` option controls the percentage of transactions that are sampled and sent to Sentry for performance monitoring. This is useful for reducing the amount of data sent to Sentry in high-traffic environments. The `tracesSampleRate` option is used specifically for performance monitoring traces.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactNavigationV5Instrumentation,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1, // Capture 10% of transactions
})
```

### 3. Using Different Environments

It's crucial to differentiate errors from development, staging, and production environments. You can do this by setting the `environment` option in `Sentry.init()`.

```javascript
const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
  environment: environment,
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactNavigationV5Instrumentation,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2,
})
```

### 4. Configure with Expo

If you're using Expo, Sentry provides an easy-to-use configuration. Follow the steps outlined in the [Sentry Expo documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/expo/). This typically involves installing the `sentry-expo` package and using the Expo CLI to configure Sentry.

## Troubleshooting

- **Errors Not Showing Up:** Double-check your DSN. Ensure it's correct and properly configured in your `Sentry.init()` call. Also, verify that your internet connection is stable, as Sentry needs to be able to send data to the Sentry servers. Check your browser's developer console for any errors related to Sentry.
- **Source Maps Not Working:** Ensure you've correctly uploaded your source maps to Sentry. Check the Sentry documentation for your build process and deployment platform to see how to automate this process.
- **Performance Issues:** If you notice performance issues after integrating Sentry, adjust the `tracesSampleRate` to a lower value. Profile your application to identify any performance bottlenecks caused by the Sentry SDK.

## Conclusion

Sentry is an invaluable tool for error tracking in React Native applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively monitor and fix errors, improve your app's stability, and enhance the user experience. Remember to regularly review errors, configure alerts, and test your Sentry integration to ensure it's working correctly. By implementing these best practices, you can proactively address issues and deliver a high-quality React Native application. Good luck!
