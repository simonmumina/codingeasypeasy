# How to Change CMD Font Size on Windows: A Comprehensive Guide

The Command Prompt (CMD) is a powerful tool in Windows for executing commands, running scripts, and troubleshooting system issues. However, the default font size can sometimes be too small, making it difficult to read the output, especially when working with long lines of text or complex scripts. This guide will walk you through various methods to change the font size in CMD, improving your command-line experience.

## Why Change the CMD Font Size?

*   **Improved Readability:** Larger fonts make text easier to read, reducing eye strain, especially during extended coding sessions.
*   **Accessibility:** Users with visual impairments can benefit greatly from a larger, more accessible font size.
*   **Customization:** Personalizing the CMD window allows you to tailor your environment to your preferences, leading to a more comfortable and efficient workflow.
*   **Presentation:**  When presenting or sharing your screen, a larger font size ensures that viewers can easily see the commands and output.

## Method 1: Using the Properties Window (Right-click Title Bar) - The Easiest Approach

This is the most common and straightforward method for changing the CMD font size.

1.  **Open Command Prompt:** You can find it by searching for "cmd" in the Start Menu or by pressing `Win + R` and typing `cmd` followed by Enter.

2.  **Access Properties:** Right-click on the **title bar** of the Command Prompt window. A context menu will appear. Select "Properties".

3.  **Navigate to the "Font" Tab:** In the "Command Prompt Properties" window, click on the "Font" tab.

4.  **Select Font Size:**  Under the "Size" section, you'll see a list of available font sizes.  Choose the font size that suits your needs. The window displays a preview of how the selected size will look.

5.  **Select Font (Optional):** While you're on the "Font" tab, you can also change the font type itself. Consolas is a commonly used and recommended font for coding environments due to its clarity and readability.  "Raster Fonts" are older, fixed-width fonts that may not scale as well.  TrueType fonts generally provide better rendering and scaling.

6.  **Click "OK":** Once you've selected your desired font size and font type, click "OK" to apply the changes.

7.  **Apply Changes:** A dialog box will appear asking if you want to apply the changes to the current window only or save them as the default settings for future Command Prompt windows.

    *   **"Apply properties to current window only"**: This changes the font size only for the current CMD window instance. When you open a new CMD window, it will revert to the default settings.
    *   **"Modify shortcut that started this window"**:  This applies the changes to the shortcut used to launch the command prompt, making the changes persistent for future sessions launched from that shortcut.  This is usually the preferred option if you want the change to be permanent.

    Choose the option that best fits your needs.  It's generally recommended to select the "Modify shortcut" option for a permanent change.

## Method 2: Using the Defaults Window (Right-click Title Bar)

The "Defaults" window provides a similar interface to the "Properties" window, but the changes made here affect *all* new Command Prompt windows.

1.  **Open Command Prompt:** As before, search for "cmd" or use `Win + R`.

2.  **Access Defaults:** Right-click on the title bar and select "Defaults."

3.  **Navigate to the "Font" Tab:** Click on the "Font" tab.

4.  **Select Font Size and Font:** Choose your desired font size and font type.

5.  **Click "OK":**  Click "OK" to save the changes.

This method is beneficial when you want to ensure all future CMD windows use the same font settings.

## Method 3: Modifying the Registry (Advanced)

**Warning: Incorrectly modifying the registry can cause serious system problems. Back up your registry before proceeding.**

This method allows for more granular control over the CMD font settings, but it's also more complex and potentially risky.

1.  **Open Registry Editor:** Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter.

2.  **Navigate to the Console Key:** In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following key:

    `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console`

3.  **Modify Font Size:**

    *   **Find or Create Value:** Look for a value named `FontSize`. If it doesn't exist, right-click in the right pane, select "New" -> "DWORD (32-bit) Value", and name it `FontSize`.
    *   **Modify Value:** Double-click on the `FontSize` value. In the "Edit DWORD (32-bit) Value" window:
        *   Select the "Decimal" radio button.
        *   Enter the desired font size (e.g., 20 for a size 20 font).
        *   Click "OK".

    **Alternatively, you can also adjust the font face and other settings using other registry keys within the `Console` key, such as `FaceName` for the font name.**

4.  **Close Registry Editor:** Close the Registry Editor.

5.  **Restart CMD:** Restart the Command Prompt for the changes to take effect.  You may need to restart your computer for the changes to fully apply.

**Example Registry Script (.reg file):**

You can create a `.reg` file to automate this process.  Copy the following code into a text file, save it with a `.reg` extension (e.g., `cmd_font_size.reg`), and then double-click the file to import it into the registry.

```reg
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console]
"FontSize"=dword:00000014  ; 20 in decimal
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`: Specifies the registry editor version.
*   `[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console]`: Specifies the registry key to modify.
*   `"FontSize"=dword:00000014`: Sets the `FontSize` value to 20 (hexadecimal 0x14 is equivalent to decimal 20).

Remember to adjust the value (0x00000014) to your desired font size in hexadecimal format.  You can use a calculator in programmer mode to convert decimal to hexadecimal.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Changes Not Applying:** Ensure you selected the correct option when closing the Properties window ("Modify shortcut that started this window" for permanent changes). If using the Registry Editor, double-check the values you entered and restart CMD or your computer.  Also, make sure you are modifying the registry for the *current user* (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER`).
*   **Font Looks Blurry:**  Try different fonts. Some fonts render better in CMD than others. Consolas, Lucida Console, and Courier New are generally good choices.  Also, experiment with ClearType settings in Windows.
*   **Font Size Resets After Reboot:**  This usually means that the changes were not saved correctly to the shortcut or the registry.  Revisit the instructions for your chosen method and ensure you followed all steps.
*   **CMD Window Size is Too Small/Large:** You can adjust the window size on the "Layout" tab in the Properties window.

## Other Customization Options

The Command Prompt Properties and Defaults windows offer numerous other customization options, including:

*   **Screen Buffer Size:**  Controls the amount of text that can be stored in the command history (Layout tab).
*   **Window Size:** Sets the width and height of the CMD window (Layout tab).
*   **Window Position:**  Specifies the initial position of the CMD window (Layout tab).
*   **Colors:** Customize the text and background colors (Colors tab).
*   **Cursor Size:**  Adjust the size of the cursor (Options tab).
*   **Command History:** Configure the size of the command history buffer (Options tab).

Experiment with these settings to create a Command Prompt environment that is tailored to your specific needs and preferences.  Consider using tools like [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/) for an even more modern and customizable command-line experience.  Windows Terminal supports tabs, multiple shells (PowerShell, CMD, WSL), custom themes, and much more.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily change the font size in your Windows Command Prompt, making it more readable and comfortable to use. Whether you prefer the simplicity of the Properties window or the advanced control of the Registry Editor, you can find a method that suits your needs. Remember to back up your registry before making any changes, and enjoy your customized command-line experience!
