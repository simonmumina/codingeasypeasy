# How to Run a Django Development Server on a Different Port: A Comprehensive Guide

When developing web applications with Django, the built-in development server is an invaluable tool. By default, it runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. However, there are situations where you might need to run your Django development server on a different port. Perhaps port 8000 is already in use, or you need to run multiple Django projects concurrently. This guide will walk you through various methods to achieve this, offering detailed explanations and practical code examples.

## Why Change the Default Port?

Before diving into the "how," let's briefly consider the "why." Here are a few common scenarios where changing the default port is necessary:

- **Port Conflicts:** Another application might already be using port 8000.
- **Multiple Projects:** You may be working on multiple Django projects simultaneously and need each project to run on a different port to avoid conflicts.
- **Security Considerations (less common for development):** While not a primary security measure, in some development environments, using a non-standard port can provide a slight (though minimal) level of obscurity.
- **Testing Different Port Configurations:** You might need to test how your application behaves on a specific port for deployment-related reasons.

## Method 1: Using the Command Line

The simplest and most common way to change the port of your Django development server is by specifying the port number as an argument when running the `runserver` command.

```plaintext
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

In this example, we're telling Django to start the development server on port 8080. You can replace `8080` with any available port number (e.g., 8001, 9000, etc.). Django will automatically bind to the IP address `127.0.0.1` (localhost) by default.

To specify a different IP address as well, you can use:

```plaintext
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Using `0.0.0.0` makes the server accessible from other machines on the same network. **Important:** Be cautious when using `0.0.0.0` in development, especially if you're working on sensitive projects. Ensure your network is secure and understand the implications of making your development server accessible to others.

**Explanation:**

- `python manage.py`: This invokes the Django management script.
- `runserver`: This is the management command to start the development server.
- `8080`: This is the port number you want to use.
- `0.0.0.0:8080`: This specifies the IP address (0.0.0.0, meaning all available interfaces) and the port number.

## Method 2: Using Environment Variables

Another approach is to set the port number using an environment variable. While not directly supported by `manage.py runserver`, we can leverage a small code snippet to achieve this:

1.  **Install `python-dotenv` (if you don't have it already):**

    ```plaintext
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file in your project root:**

    Add the following line to your `.env` file:

    ```
    DJANGO_PORT=8001
    ```

    Replace `8001` with your desired port.

3.  **Modify your `manage.py` file:**

    Add the following lines at the beginning of your `manage.py` file _before_ the `os.environ.setdefault` line:

    ```plaintext
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv() # Load environment variables from .env
    ```

4.  **Run the server:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    Django will now read the `DJANGO_PORT` environment variable and use that port. If the variable isn't set, it will fall back to the default port 8000.

**Explanation:**

- `python-dotenv` allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping your configuration separate from your code.
- We load the environment variables at the beginning of `manage.py`.
- The `runserver` command now reads the `DJANGO_PORT` environment variable.

**A more robust solution involves using `os.getenv` in the `runserver` call which requires slightly more coding but avoids modifying `manage.py`:**

1. Create a file `run.py` at your project root containing this:

```plaintext
import os
import subprocess
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # load environment variables from .env if it exists

port = os.getenv("DJANGO_PORT", "8000")
ip_address = os.getenv("DJANGO_IP", "127.0.0.1")

command = ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", f"{ip_address}:{port}"]
subprocess.run(command)
```

2. Run the development server:

```plaintext
python run.py
```

**Explanation:**

- The `run.py` script loads environment variables from the `.env` file (if it exists).
- It uses `os.getenv` to get the values for `DJANGO_PORT` and `DJANGO_IP`, providing default values if they are not set.
- It constructs the `runserver` command with the specified IP address and port.
- It executes the command using `subprocess.run`. This avoids directly calling `manage.py`, allowing for more flexible configuration.
- This approach avoids modifications to `manage.py`

## Method 3: Using a Custom Management Command (More Advanced)

For more complex scenarios or when you want greater control, you can create a custom management command to handle the port configuration.

1.  **Create a `management/commands` directory inside your app directory.** Make sure you have an `__init__.py` file in both `management` and `commands` directories to make them Python packages.

2.  **Create a file named `runserver_custom.py` (or any descriptive name) inside the `management/commands` directory.**

3.  **Add the following code to `runserver_custom.py`:**

    ```plaintext
    from django.core.management.commands.runserver import Command as RunserverCommand
    from django.conf import settings
    import os


    class Command(RunserverCommand):
        help = "Starts the Django development server on a custom port (configured in settings)."

        def get_command(self):
            if hasattr(settings, "DEV_SERVER_PORT"):
                return [self.script_name, "runserver", str(settings.DEV_SERVER_PORT)]
            else:
                return [self.script_name, "runserver"]
    ```

4.  **Modify `settings.py`:**

```plaintext
# settings.py
DEV_SERVER_PORT = os.getenv("DJANGO_PORT", 8081) # or 8001 etc.
```

5.  **Run the server:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py runserver_custom
    ```

**Explanation:**

- We're creating a custom management command that inherits from Django's built-in `runserver` command.
- The `handle` method is overridden to read the desired port from `settings.DEV_SERVER_PORT`.
- The `settings.py` file now contains the `DEV_SERVER_PORT` setting. This allows you to configure the port in your Django settings. This settings value is overwritten by the env variable.
- Using a custom command gives you more control over how the server is started and allows you to integrate other custom configurations.

## Method 4: Using the WSGI Server Directly (For Advanced Cases)

While primarily used for production deployments, you _can_ use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI directly in development for testing purposes. This gives you the most control over server configuration but is generally overkill for basic development.

Here's a basic example using Gunicorn:

1.  **Install Gunicorn:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install gunicorn
    ```

2.  **Run Gunicorn:**

    ```plaintext
    gunicorn your_project.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8002
    ```

    Replace `your_project` with the name of your Django project.

**Explanation:**

- `gunicorn`: The Gunicorn WSGI server.
- `your_project.wsgi:application`: Specifies the WSGI application object.
- `--bind 0.0.0.0:8002`: Binds the server to all interfaces on port 8002.

**Important Considerations for WSGI Servers:**

- **Static Files:** When using a WSGI server directly, you'll need to configure it to serve static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) properly. Django's development server handles this automatically, but WSGI servers typically require a separate static file server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or a configuration to serve static files directly (which is _not_ recommended for production).
- **Debugging:** Debugging can be more challenging when using a WSGI server directly.
- **Complexity:** This method adds complexity to your development environment and is typically only used for testing production-like deployments.

## Choosing the Right Method

- **Command Line:** The easiest and most common method for simple port changes.
- **Environment Variables:** Useful for configuring the port dynamically or when working with containerized environments.
- **Custom Management Command:** Provides more control and allows you to integrate custom configurations.
- **WSGI Server Directly:** Used for testing production-like deployments and requires more advanced configuration.

## Common Problems and Solutions

- **"Address already in use" Error:** This error indicates that the port you're trying to use is already being used by another application. Make sure no other processes are listening on that port. You can use tools like `netstat` (Linux/macOS) or `Resource Monitor` (Windows) to identify which process is using the port.

- **Firewall Issues:** If you're trying to access the development server from another machine, make sure your firewall isn't blocking the port.

- **Incorrect IP Address:** If you're binding to `0.0.0.0`, ensure that your network is properly configured and that other machines can reach your development server.

## Conclusion

Changing the port of your Django development server is a straightforward task that can be accomplished using various methods. Choosing the appropriate method depends on your specific needs and the complexity of your development environment. By understanding the techniques outlined in this guide, you can easily configure your Django development server to run on any available port, avoiding conflicts and ensuring a smooth development experience. Remember to always consider security implications, especially when binding to `0.0.0.0`. Happy coding!
