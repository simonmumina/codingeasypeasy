# Create a Proxy Server on Heroku with Node.js: A Comprehensive Guide

Creating a proxy server can be incredibly useful for various purposes, including bypassing geographical restrictions, anonymizing your web traffic, or acting as a gateway to internal resources. Heroku provides an excellent platform for deploying such servers, and Node.js is a powerful and lightweight language for building them. This guide will walk you through the process of building and deploying a Node.js proxy server on Heroku, step-by-step.

## What is a Proxy Server?

Before we dive into the implementation, let's quickly define what a proxy server is. In essence, a proxy server acts as an intermediary between your client (e.g., your web browser) and the destination server (e.g., Google.com). Instead of directly connecting to the destination server, your client connects to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the destination server and relays the response back to your client.

**Types of Proxies:**

- **Forward Proxy:** A forward proxy sits in front of a client (like your browser) and protects its identity when making requests to the internet.
- **Reverse Proxy:** A reverse proxy sits in front of one or more web servers and handles client requests, forwarding them to the appropriate server. This is useful for load balancing, security, and caching. This is the type we'll primarily be building in this guide.

## Why Use Heroku?

Heroku is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that makes deploying and managing web applications incredibly easy. Here are a few reasons why Heroku is a great choice for hosting your proxy server:

- **Ease of Deployment:** Deploying a Node.js application to Heroku is a straightforward process.
- **Scalability:** Heroku can automatically scale your application to handle increasing traffic.
- **Free Tier (with limitations):** Heroku offers a free tier, which is suitable for testing and small-scale deployments.
- **Managed Infrastructure:** Heroku handles the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on your application code.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm:** Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.
- **Heroku CLI:** Install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) from [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
- **A Heroku Account:** Sign up for a free Heroku account at [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Step 1: Setting up Your Project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```plaintext
mkdir heroku-proxy
cd heroku-proxy
```

Initialize a new Node.js project:

```plaintext
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file with default settings.

## Step 2: Installing Dependencies

We'll use the following npm packages:

- **`express`:** A popular Node.js web application framework.
- **`http-proxy`:** A powerful library for creating HTTP proxies.
- **`dotenv`:** (Optional) For managing environment variables.

Install these packages:

```plaintext
npm install express http-proxy dotenv
```

## Step 3: Creating the Proxy Server Code

Create a file named `index.js` (or any other name you prefer) and add the following code:

```plaintext
const express = require('express')
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware')
const dotenv = require('dotenv')

dotenv.config() // Load environment variables from .env file (if it exists)

const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

// Target URL:  This is where your proxy will forward requests to.  Change this to your desired target.
const targetURL = process.env.TARGET_URL || 'https://www.google.com'

// Proxy middleware configuration
const proxyOptions = {
  target: targetURL,
  changeOrigin: true, // Required for virtual hosted sites
  logLevel: 'debug', // Optional:  For debugging the proxy
  onProxyRes: (proxyRes, req, res) => {
    // You can modify the response headers here, if needed.
    // For example, remove security headers that might expose your target server.
    delete proxyRes.headers['x-powered-by']
  },
  onError: (err, req, res) => {
    console.error('Proxy Error:', err)
    res.status(500).send('Proxy Error')
  },
}

// Create the proxy middleware
const proxy = createProxyMiddleware('/', proxyOptions)

// Use the proxy middleware for all requests
app.use('/', proxy)

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Proxy server listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`require`:** Imports the necessary modules.
- **`dotenv.config()`:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file (if one exists). This is useful for storing sensitive information like API keys or the target URL.
- **`process.env.PORT`:** Gets the port number from the `PORT` environment variable. Heroku sets this automatically. If it's not set, it defaults to port 3000.
- **`process.env.TARGET_URL`:** Gets the target URL from the `TARGET_URL` environment variable. This allows you to configure the proxy target without modifying the code. If it's not set, it defaults to Google.
- **`createProxyMiddleware`:** Creates the proxy middleware. The first argument is the path to match (in this case, `/` means all paths). The second argument is an object containing the proxy options.
- **`target`:** The URL of the target server to proxy to.
- **`changeOrigin`:** Sets the `Host` header of the request to the target URL. This is often required for virtual hosted sites to work correctly.
- **`logLevel`:** Sets the logging level for the proxy. `debug` is useful for troubleshooting.
- **`onProxyRes`:** A callback function that is called when the proxy receives a response from the target server. You can use this to modify the response headers before sending them to the client. In this example, we're removing the `x-powered-by` header.
- **`onError`:** A callback function that is called when an error occurs during the proxying process. This allows you to handle errors gracefully and return a user-friendly error message.
- **`app.use('/', proxy)`:** Registers the proxy middleware to handle all requests to the root path (`/`).
- **`app.listen`:** Starts the server and listens for incoming requests.

## Step 4: Creating a `Procfile`

Heroku needs a `Procfile` to know how to run your application. Create a file named `Procfile` (without any file extension) in the root of your project directory and add the following line:

```
web: node index.js
```

This tells Heroku to run the `index.js` file using Node.js when the application starts.

## Step 5: Configuring Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to configure the target URL using an environment variable, create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the following line:

```
TARGET_URL=https://api.example.com  # Replace with your desired target URL
```

**Important:** Do not commit your `.env` file to your Git repository, especially if it contains sensitive information like API keys. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

Create a `.gitignore` file (if you don't already have one) and add the following line:

```
.env
node_modules
```

## Step 6: Deploying to Heroku

1.  **Log in to Heroku:**

    ```plaintext
    heroku login
    ```

2.  **Create a Heroku application:**

    ```plaintext
    heroku create
    ```

    This will create a new Heroku application and print its name to the console (e.g., `frozen-brook-12345`).

3.  **Initialize a Git repository:**

    ```plaintext
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Push your code to Heroku:**

    ```plaintext
    heroku git:remote -a <your-heroku-app-name>  # Replace <your-heroku-app-name> with the name of your Heroku app
    git push heroku main
    ```

    This will deploy your application to Heroku.

5.  **Set the `TARGET_URL` environment variable (if you're using it):**

    ```plaintext
    heroku config:set TARGET_URL=https://api.example.com  # Replace with your desired target URL
    ```

6.  **Scale the dyno:** (If not already done by default)

    ```plaintext
    heroku ps:scale web=1
    ```

7.  **Open your Heroku application in your browser:**

    ```plaintext
    heroku open
    ```

    This will open your application in your browser. You should see the content from the target URL.

## Step 7: Testing Your Proxy Server

Open your web browser and navigate to your Heroku application's URL. You should see the content from the target URL.

You can also test your proxy server using `curl`:

```plaintext
curl <your-heroku-app-url>
```

This will print the HTML source code of the target URL.

## Customizing Your Proxy Server

Here are some ways you can customize your proxy server:

- **Adding Authentication:** You can add authentication to your proxy server to restrict access to authorized users. This can be done using basic authentication, API keys, or OAuth.
- **Caching:** You can implement caching to improve performance by storing frequently accessed resources on the proxy server.
- **Request Modification:** You can modify the request before sending it to the target server. For example, you can add headers, change the URL, or modify the request body.
- **Response Modification:** You can modify the response before sending it to the client. For example, you can add headers, remove headers, or modify the response body.
- **Load Balancing:** You can configure your proxy server to load balance requests across multiple target servers. This can improve performance and availability.

## Example: Adding Basic Authentication

To add basic authentication, you can use the `basic-auth` middleware. First, install it:

```plaintext
npm install basic-auth
```

Then, modify your `index.js` file:

```plaintext
const express = require('express')
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware')
const basicAuth = require('basic-auth')
const dotenv = require('dotenv')

dotenv.config()

const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
const targetURL = process.env.TARGET_URL || 'https://www.google.com'

// Authentication middleware
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  const user = basicAuth(req)

  if (!user || user.name !== process.env.PROXY_USER || user.pass !== process.env.PROXY_PASSWORD) {
    res.setHeader('WWW-Authenticate', 'Basic realm="Proxy Authentication"')
    return res.status(401).send('Authentication required.')
  }

  next()
}

// Proxy middleware configuration
const proxyOptions = {
  target: targetURL,
  changeOrigin: true,
  logLevel: 'debug',
  onProxyRes: (proxyRes, req, res) => {
    delete proxyRes.headers['x-powered-by']
  },
  onError: (err, req, res) => {
    console.error('Proxy Error:', err)
    res.status(500).send('Proxy Error')
  },
}

const proxy = createProxyMiddleware('/', proxyOptions)

// Use authentication middleware before the proxy middleware
app.use(auth)
app.use('/', proxy)

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Proxy server listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

Set the `PROXY_USER` and `PROXY_PASSWORD` environment variables on Heroku:

```plaintext
heroku config:set PROXY_USER=myuser PROXY_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

Now, when you try to access your proxy server, you will be prompted for a username and password.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Application Error` on Heroku:** Check your Heroku logs using `heroku logs --tail`. This will often reveal the underlying error.
- **Proxy Not Working:** Double-check that the `TARGET_URL` is correct and that the target server is accessible. Make sure `changeOrigin` is set to `true` if the target server requires it. Examine the `logLevel: 'debug'` output for clues.
- **Authentication Issues:** Verify that the username and password are correct and that the environment variables are set correctly.

## Conclusion

This guide has shown you how to create and deploy a simple proxy server on Heroku using Node.js. You can now customize this server to meet your specific needs, such as adding authentication, caching, or request/response modification. Remember to handle environment variables securely and regularly review your logs for any errors or security concerns. Happy proxying!
