# Git Hooks: Automate Your Workflow and Boost Code Quality (With Examples)

Git hooks are powerful tools that can significantly enhance your development workflow and improve the quality of your code. They allow you to run custom scripts automatically at various points in the Git lifecycle, such as before a commit, after a merge, or before pushing to a remote repository. This article provides a comprehensive guide to Git hooks, covering their functionality, common use cases, and practical examples to help you integrate them into your projects.

## What are Git Hooks?

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are located in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository. Each hook is a simple executable script, and Git executes them when the corresponding event occurs. You can write hooks in any scripting language you prefer, such as Bash, Python, Ruby, or even Node.js.

Think of them like event listeners in JavaScript, but for your Git repository. When a specific Git action happens (like committing), the corresponding hook script is triggered, allowing you to perform actions like running tests, linting code, or enforcing coding standards.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Executable Scripts:** Git hooks are executable scripts (e.g., Bash, Python, Ruby). Make sure the script has execute permissions (`chmod +x <hook_name>`).
- **Stored Locally:** Git hooks reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository. This directory is _not_ tracked by Git, meaning the hooks are not automatically shared with other collaborators. We'll discuss ways to share and manage hooks later in this article.
- **Customizable:** You define the logic of each hook script to perform the actions you need.
- **Triggered by Git Events:** Each hook is triggered by a specific Git event (e.g., `pre-commit`, `post-commit`, `pre-push`).

## Where are Git Hooks Located?

As mentioned earlier, Git hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository. This directory contains sample hook scripts with the `.sample` extension. To enable a hook, you need to remove the `.sample` extension and make the script executable.

For example, you'll find `pre-commit.sample` in the `.git/hooks` directory. To enable the `pre-commit` hook, you would rename it to `pre-commit` and make it executable:

```plaintext
cd .git/hooks
mv pre-commit.sample pre-commit
chmod +x pre-commit
```

Now, every time you attempt to commit changes, Git will execute the `pre-commit` script.

## Common Git Hooks and Use Cases

Git provides a variety of hooks that can be used to automate different tasks. Here's a breakdown of some of the most commonly used hooks and their typical use cases:

- **`pre-commit`:** This hook runs before a commit is created. It's ideal for tasks such as:

  - **Linting and Formatting Code:** Enforce consistent code style and identify potential errors using tools like ESLint, Prettier, or RuboCop.
  - **Running Unit Tests:** Ensure that all unit tests pass before allowing a commit to proceed.
  - **Checking for Code Quality Issues:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, or performance bottlenecks.
  - **Preventing Commits with Debugging Statements:** Avoid accidentally committing code with `console.log` or other debugging statements.
  - **Validating Commit Messages:** Enforce a specific format for commit messages to improve readability and maintainability.

- **`prepare-commit-msg`:** This hook runs after the commit message editor is started but before the user has entered a message. It's useful for:

  - **Generating Commit Message Templates:** Automatically populate the commit message editor with a template to guide users in writing informative commit messages.
  - **Adding Issue Tracker IDs:** Automatically include issue tracker IDs (e.g., Jira ticket numbers) in commit messages.

- **`commit-msg`:** This hook runs after the user has entered a commit message but before the commit is created. It's used for:

  - **Validating Commit Message Content:** Ensure that the commit message adheres to specific rules, such as a maximum length or a specific format.

- **`post-commit`:** This hook runs after a commit is created. It's suitable for:

  - **Triggering Notifications:** Send notifications to team members or update issue trackers.
  - **Running Integration Tests:** Kick off integration tests after a commit has been made.

- **`pre-push`:** This hook runs before you push your changes to a remote repository. It's an excellent place to:

  - **Run Integration Tests:** Ensure that all integration tests pass before allowing the push to proceed.
  - **Check Code Coverage:** Verify that the code coverage meets a minimum threshold.
  - **Prevent Pushing Broken Code:** Prevent pushing code that fails tests or violates coding standards.

- **`post-receive`:** This hook runs on the remote repository after a push has been successfully received. It's often used for:
  - **Deploying Code:** Automatically deploy the changes to a production or staging environment.
  - **Sending Notifications:** Notify team members about the successful deployment.

## Practical Examples of Git Hooks

Let's explore some practical examples of Git hooks to illustrate how they can be used to automate your workflow.

**Example 1: `pre-commit` hook to lint and format code with Prettier**

This example demonstrates how to use a `pre-commit` hook to automatically lint and format your code using Prettier before each commit. This ensures that your code adheres to a consistent style and reduces the likelihood of code style related issues during code review.

First, install Prettier as a dev dependency in your project:

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev prettier
```

Then, create a `.prettierrc.js` file in the root of your project to configure Prettier according to your preferences. Here's a simple example:

```plaintext
// .prettierrc.js
module.exports = {
  semi: true,
  trailingComma: 'all',
  singleQuote: true,
  printWidth: 120,
  tabWidth: 2,
}
```

Next, create the `pre-commit` hook script in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Prettier is installed
if ! command -v prettier &> /dev/null
then
  echo "Prettier is not installed. Please install it with 'npm install --save-dev prettier'."
  exit 1
fi

# Stage any changes made by Prettier
git add $(prettier --write ./*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,md})

# Check if there were any formatting changes
if git diff --cached --quiet
then
  echo "No formatting changes detected."
else
  echo "Formatting changes detected. Please review and commit."
  exit 1
fi
```

Make the script executable:

```plaintext
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The script starts with a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) to specify the interpreter.
2.  It checks if Prettier is installed. If not, it displays an error message and exits.
3.  It runs Prettier on all JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript, TSX, JSON, and Markdown files in the project directory, automatically writing any formatting changes.
4.  It stages the changes made by Prettier using `git add`.
5.  It uses `git diff --cached --quiet` to check if there were any formatting changes. If there were no changes, it means the code was already formatted correctly.
6.  If there were formatting changes, it displays a message and exits with a non-zero exit code, preventing the commit.

**Example 2: `pre-push` hook to run unit tests**

This example demonstrates how to use a `pre-push` hook to run unit tests before pushing your changes to a remote repository. This helps prevent pushing broken code that could break the build on the remote server.

Assuming you are using Jest for unit testing, create the `pre-push` hook script in `.git/hooks/pre-push`:

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Jest is installed
if ! command -v jest &> /dev/null
then
  echo "Jest is not installed. Please install it with 'npm install --save-dev jest'."
  exit 1
fi

# Run unit tests with Jest
echo "Running unit tests..."
npm test  # Or yarn test, depending on your package manager

# Check if the tests passed
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Unit tests failed. Please fix the errors and try again."
  exit 1
else
  echo "All unit tests passed!"
fi
```

Make the script executable:

```plaintext
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The script checks if Jest is installed. If not, it displays an error message and exits.
2.  It runs the unit tests using `npm test` (or `yarn test`).
3.  It checks the exit code of the test command. If the exit code is not 0, it means the tests failed.
4.  If the tests failed, it displays an error message and exits with a non-zero exit code, preventing the push.
5.  If the tests passed, it displays a success message.

**Example 3: `commit-msg` hook to validate commit messages**

This example demonstrates how to use a `commit-msg` hook to validate that commit messages adhere to a specific format. This can help improve the consistency and readability of your commit history. We'll enforce a simple rule: commit messages must start with an uppercase letter.

Create the `commit-msg` hook script in `.git/hooks/commit-msg`:

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

# Get the commit message file path
COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1

# Read the commit message
COMMIT_MSG=$(cat "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE")

# Check if the commit message is empty
if [ -z "$COMMIT_MSG" ]; then
  echo "Commit message cannot be empty."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the first character is uppercase
FIRST_CHAR=$(echo "$COMMIT_MSG" | head -c 1)
if [[ ! "$FIRST_CHAR" =~ [A-Z] ]]; then
  echo "Commit message must start with an uppercase letter."
  exit 1
fi

# All checks passed
exit 0
```

Make the script executable:

```plaintext
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The script retrieves the path to the commit message file from the first argument (`$1`).
2.  It reads the content of the commit message file into the `COMMIT_MSG` variable.
3.  It checks if the commit message is empty. If it is, it displays an error message and exits.
4.  It extracts the first character of the commit message.
5.  It checks if the first character is an uppercase letter using a regular expression. If it's not, it displays an error message and exits.

## Sharing and Managing Git Hooks

As mentioned earlier, Git hooks are stored locally in the `.git/hooks` directory, which is not tracked by Git. This means that hooks are not automatically shared with other collaborators. This can be problematic if you want to enforce consistent coding standards and workflows across your team.

Here are a few common approaches to sharing and managing Git hooks:

- **Symbolic Links:** Create symbolic links from the `.git/hooks` directory to scripts located in a shared directory within your repository (e.g., `scripts/git-hooks`). This allows you to store the hook scripts in a tracked directory and share them with other collaborators. However, users still need to manually create the symbolic links after cloning the repository.

  ```plaintext
  mkdir scripts/git-hooks
  mv .git/hooks/pre-commit scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit
  ln -s ../../scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
  ```

- **Husky:** Husky is a popular tool that simplifies the process of managing Git hooks. It allows you to define hooks in your `package.json` file, and it automatically installs and configures them when collaborators install dependencies. Husky handles the creation of symbolic links for you.

  ```plaintext
  npm install --save-dev husky
  ```

  Add the following to your `package.json` file:

  ```plaintext
  {
    "husky": {
      "hooks": {
        "pre-commit": "npm run lint && npm run test"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  This will run the `lint` and `test` scripts defined in your `package.json` before each commit.

- **pre-commit:** `pre-commit` is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. It allows you to define a set of hooks in a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, and it automatically installs and runs them before each commit.

  ```plaintext
  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit install
  ```

  Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root of your repository:

  ```plaintext
  # .pre-commit-config.yaml
  repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v4.5.0
      hooks:
        - id: trailing-whitespace
        - id: end-of-file-fixer
        - id: check-yaml
        - id: check-added-large-files
    - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
      rev: 24.2.0
      hooks:
        - id: black
  ```

- **Git Management Tools (e.g., GitLab, GitHub):** Some Git management tools, like GitLab and GitHub, offer features for enforcing commit hooks server-side. This ensures that hooks are enforced regardless of whether developers have configured them locally.

Choosing the best approach depends on your project's needs and team's preferences. Husky and `pre-commit` are generally preferred for their ease of use and automation capabilities.

## Best Practices for Git Hooks

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when working with Git hooks:

- **Keep Hooks Simple and Focused:** Avoid creating overly complex hooks that perform too many tasks. Break down complex logic into smaller, more manageable hooks.
- **Ensure Hooks are Fast:** Hooks should execute quickly to avoid slowing down the development workflow. Optimize your hook scripts for performance.
- **Provide Clear Error Messages:** If a hook fails, provide clear and informative error messages to help users understand the problem and how to fix it.
- **Use a Scripting Language You're Comfortable With:** Choose a scripting language that you are familiar with and that is well-suited for the task at hand.
- **Test Your Hooks Thoroughly:** Test your hooks in a staging environment before deploying them to production.
- **Consider Using a Git Hook Management Tool:** Tools like Husky and `pre-commit` can simplify the process of managing and sharing Git hooks.
- **Document Your Hooks:** Clearly document the purpose and functionality of each hook.
- **Handle Edge Cases Gracefully:** Anticipate potential edge cases and handle them gracefully in your hook scripts. For example, handle cases where required tools are not installed or where files are missing.
- **Avoid Modifying the Staging Area Unnecessarily:** While some hooks (like the Prettier example) might modify the staging area, try to avoid making unnecessary changes. Changes to the staging area can sometimes lead to unexpected conflicts.

## Conclusion

Git hooks are a powerful tool for automating your workflow, improving code quality, and streamlining your development process. By leveraging Git hooks, you can enforce coding standards, run tests automatically, and prevent pushing broken code to your remote repository. By implementing the examples and following the best practices outlined in this article, you can effectively integrate Git hooks into your projects and enhance your development workflow. Remember to choose a method for sharing hooks that suits your team's needs and preferences to ensure consistent enforcement of your desired workflow across all contributors.
