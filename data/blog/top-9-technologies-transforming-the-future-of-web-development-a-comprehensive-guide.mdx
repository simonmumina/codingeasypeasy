// service-worker.js
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('my-app-cache').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll(['/', '/index.html', '/style.css', '/script.js'])
    })
  )
})

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request)
    })
  )
})
```

**Why are they important?** PWAs bridge the gap between web and native apps, providing a superior user experience and increased reach.

## 5. Static Site Generators (Next.js, Gatsby, Hugo)

Static site generators (SSGs) generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files at build time, resulting in fast-loading and highly performant websites. They are ideal for content-heavy websites, blogs, and documentation sites.

- **Benefits:** Improved performance, enhanced security, easier deployment, and SEO-friendliness.

- **Popular Options:** Next.js (React), Gatsby (React), Hugo (Go), Jekyll (Ruby).
