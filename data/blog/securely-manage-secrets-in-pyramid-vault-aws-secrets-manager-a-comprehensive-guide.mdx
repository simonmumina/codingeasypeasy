# Securely Manage Secrets in Pyramid (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager): A Comprehensive Guide

In today's security-conscious environment, hardcoding sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, and other secrets directly into your application code or configuration files is a major no-no. This practice creates vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited by malicious actors.  This guide will explore how to securely manage secrets in your Pyramid web applications using two popular solutions: HashiCorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager.  We'll cover the benefits of each approach, and provide practical code examples to help you integrate them into your projects.

## Why Use a Secrets Management Solution?

Before diving into the specifics, let's highlight the core benefits of using a dedicated secrets management solution:

*   **Centralized Secrets Management:** Store all your secrets in a central, secure location, making it easier to manage and control access.
*   **Access Control:** Implement granular access control policies to restrict which applications and users can access specific secrets.
*   **Encryption:** Encrypt secrets both in transit and at rest, protecting them from unauthorized access even if the underlying storage is compromised.
*   **Auditing:** Track all access to secrets, providing valuable insights for security monitoring and compliance purposes.
*   **Secrets Rotation:** Automate the rotation of secrets on a regular basis, minimizing the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Version Control:** Maintain a history of secrets, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
*   **Eliminates Hardcoding:** Removes sensitive data directly from your code and configuration files.

## Choosing the Right Solution: Vault vs. AWS Secrets Manager

Both Vault and AWS Secrets Manager are excellent choices for managing secrets, but they cater to different needs and environments:

*   **HashiCorp Vault:** A general-purpose secrets management solution that can be deployed in various environments, including on-premises, cloud, and hybrid setups. It supports multiple secrets engines, authentication methods, and access control policies, making it a highly flexible and customizable option. Vault is ideal for organizations that need a platform-agnostic solution and require fine-grained control over their secrets.

*   **AWS Secrets Manager:** A secrets management service specifically designed for AWS environments. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as EC2, Lambda, and RDS. AWS Secrets Manager is a great option for organizations that are already heavily invested in the AWS ecosystem and want a simple, managed solution. It handles secret rotation for supported AWS services automatically.

Consider these factors when making your decision:

| Feature          | HashiCorp Vault                                      | AWS Secrets Manager                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment      | Any environment (on-premises, cloud, hybrid)       | AWS Cloud                                             |
| Integration      | Wide range of integrations through APIs and plugins  | Tightly integrated with AWS services                 |
| Flexibility      | Highly flexible and customizable                   | More focused on AWS services, less general purpose |
| Complexity       | Can be more complex to set up and manage            | Simpler to set up, especially for AWS environments  |
| Pricing          | Open Source (community edition) or Enterprise Edition | Pay-per-secret and per-API-call                     |
| Secrets Rotation | Requires custom scripting or third-party solutions  | Automated for supported AWS services                |

## Integrating HashiCorp Vault with Pyramid

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to integrate HashiCorp Vault with your Pyramid application:

### 1. Prerequisites

*   A running Vault instance (either local development or a production environment)
*   A Pyramid project (you can create one using `pcreate -s starter myproject`)
*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   The `hvac` library (Python client for Vault)

Install the `hvac` library:

```bash
pip install hvac
```

### 2. Configure Vault

Before your Pyramid application can access Vault, you'll need to configure it.  For local development, you'll typically start Vault in "dev" mode:

```bash
vault server -dev
```

**Important:** Dev mode is *not* suitable for production environments. In production, you should configure Vault with a persistent storage backend and a proper authentication method (e.g., AppRole, JWT).

You will get an unseal key and root token.  Export the Vault address and token:

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN='<your root token>'
```

Next, enable a secrets engine (e.g., `kv-v2` for key-value storage):

```bash
vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2
```

Finally, write a secret to Vault:

```bash
vault kv put secret/my-app/database password="mysecretpassword" username="myuser"
```

Replace `secret/my-app/database` with a path that makes sense for your application.

### 3. Create a Pyramid Configuration Setting

Create a function to read your secret from vault and populate your settings:

```python
import hvac
import os

def get_vault_secrets(vault_address, vault_token, secret_path):
    """
    Retrieves secrets from HashiCorp Vault.

    Args:
        vault_address (str): The address of the Vault server.
        vault_token (str): The Vault token to use for authentication.
        secret_path (str): The path to the secret in Vault (e.g., "secret/my-app/database").

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the retrieved secrets.
        Returns None if there's an error reaching Vault.
    """
    try:
        client = hvac.Client(url=vault_address, token=vault_token)

        if not client.sys.is_initialized():
            raise Exception("Vault is not initialized")

        if not client.sys.is_authenticated():
            raise Exception("Vault authentication failed.")


        read_response = client.secrets.kv.v2.read_secret(
            path=secret_path,
            mount_point='secret'
        )


        return read_response['data']['data']
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving secrets from Vault: {e}")
        return None


def includeme(config):
    """
    Pyramid includeme function.
    """
    settings = config.get_settings()

    # Get Vault configuration from environment variables or settings
    vault_address = os.environ.get('VAULT_ADDR', settings.get('vault.address'))
    vault_token = os.environ.get('VAULT_TOKEN', settings.get('vault.token'))
    secret_path = settings.get('vault.secret_path')

    if not all([vault_address, vault_token, secret_path]):
        raise ValueError("Vault address, token, and secret path must be configured.")

    # Retrieve secrets from Vault
    vault_secrets = get_vault_secrets(vault_address, vault_token, secret_path)

    if vault_secrets:
        # Update Pyramid settings with the secrets
        settings.update(vault_secrets)
        print("Successfully loaded secrets from Vault")
    else:
        print("Failed to load secrets from Vault.  Check your Vault configuration.")

    config.add_settings({'db.url': f"postgresql://{settings['username']}:{settings['password']}@localhost:5432/mydb"}) #Example updating settings

# Create a new file, e.g., vault_config.py within your Pyramid project.
```

### 4.  Register the Configuration in `__init__.py`

In your Pyramid project's `__init__.py` file, include the Vault configuration:

```python
from pyramid.config import Configurator
import os


def main(global_config, **settings):
    """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
    """
    with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
        config.include('pyramid_chameleon')
        config.include('.routes')
        # Include your new vault config.
        config.include('.vault_config')
        config.scan()
    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

### 5. Configure settings

Edit the `development.ini` or `production.ini` file to pass in the necessary configuration values.

```ini
[app:main]
vault.address = http://127.0.0.1:8200 # Or the correct Vault address
vault.token = <your root token>  # Use a proper authentication method in production
vault.secret_path = secret/my-app/database
```

### 6. Access the Secrets in your application

Now you can access the secrets retrieved from Vault through the Pyramid request object:

```python
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.request import Request

@view_config(route_name='home', renderer='templates/mytemplate.pt')
def my_view(request: Request):
    db_password = request.registry.settings.get('password')
    db_username = request.registry.settings.get('username')

    return {'db_username': db_username, 'db_password':db_password, 'project': 'myproject'}
```

This code snippet retrieves the `password` and `username` values from the Pyramid settings, which were previously populated with the secrets from Vault.

## Integrating AWS Secrets Manager with Pyramid

Here's how to integrate AWS Secrets Manager with your Pyramid application:

### 1. Prerequisites

*   An AWS account with access to Secrets Manager.
*   The AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
*   A Pyramid project
*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   The `boto3` library (AWS SDK for Python)

Install the `boto3` library:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

### 2. Create a Secret in AWS Secrets Manager

Create a new secret in AWS Secrets Manager, storing your sensitive data as a JSON object. For example:

```json
{
  "database_username": "myuser",
  "database_password": "mysecretpassword"
}
```

Give your secret a descriptive name (e.g., `my-app-database-credentials`).

### 3. Configure IAM Permissions

Create an IAM role or user with the necessary permissions to access the secret you created. The IAM policy should include the following permission:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account_id>:secret:<secret_name>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `<region>`, `<account_id>`, and `<secret_name>` with your actual values.  If your application is running on EC2 or Lambda, attach this IAM role to the instance or function.

### 4. Create a Pyramid Configuration Setting

Create a function to read your secret from aws secrets manager and populate your settings:

```python
import boto3
import json
import os

def get_aws_secrets(secret_name, region_name):
    """
    Retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.

    Args:
        secret_name (str): The name of the secret in Secrets Manager.
        region_name (str): The AWS region where the secret is stored.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the retrieved secrets.
        Returns None if there's an error.
    """
    try:
        session = boto3.session.Session()
        client = session.client(
            service_name='secretsmanager',
            region_name=region_name
        )

        get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)

        if 'SecretString' in get_secret_value_response:
            secret = get_secret_value_response['SecretString']
            return json.loads(secret) # parse json
        else:
            # For a binary secret. In your case it is a string so this part isn't applicable but leaving as example
            decoded_binary_secret = base64.b64decode(get_secret_value_response['SecretBinary'])
            return json.loads(decoded_binary_secret)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager: {e}")
        return None

def includeme(config):
    """
    Pyramid includeme function.
    """
    settings = config.get_settings()

    # Get AWS Secrets Manager configuration from settings
    secret_name = settings.get('aws.secrets_manager.secret_name')
    region_name = settings.get('aws.secrets_manager.region_name')

    if not all([secret_name, region_name]):
        raise ValueError("AWS Secrets Manager secret name and region must be configured.")

    # Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
    aws_secrets = get_aws_secrets(secret_name, region_name)

    if aws_secrets:
        # Update Pyramid settings with the secrets
        settings.update(aws_secrets)
        print("Successfully loaded secrets from AWS Secrets Manager")
    else:
        print("Failed to load secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. Check your AWS configuration.")

    config.add_settings({'db.url': f"postgresql://{settings['database_username']}:{settings['database_password']}@localhost:5432/mydb"}) #Example updating settings

# Create a new file, e.g., aws_secrets_config.py within your Pyramid project.
```

### 5.  Register the Configuration in `__init__.py`

In your Pyramid project's `__init__.py` file, include the Vault configuration:

```python
from pyramid.config import Configurator
import os


def main(global_config, **settings):
    """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
    """
    with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
        config.include('pyramid_chameleon')
        config.include('.routes')
        # Include your new AWS Secrets Manager config.
        config.include('.aws_secrets_config')
        config.scan()
    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

### 6. Configure settings

Edit the `development.ini` or `production.ini` file to pass in the necessary configuration values.

```ini
[app:main]
aws.secrets_manager.secret_name = my-app-database-credentials
aws.secrets_manager.region_name = us-east-1
```

### 7. Access the Secrets in your application

Now you can access the secrets retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager through the Pyramid request object:

```python
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.request import Request

@view_config(route_name='home', renderer='templates/mytemplate.pt')
def my_view(request: Request):
    db_password = request.registry.settings.get('database_password')
    db_username = request.registry.settings.get('database_username')

    return {'db_username': db_username, 'db_password':db_password, 'project': 'myproject'}
```

This code snippet retrieves the `database_password` and `database_username` values from the Pyramid settings, which were previously populated with the secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.

## Best Practices for Secrets Management

*   **Least Privilege:** Grant applications and users only the minimum permissions required to access the secrets they need.
*   **Regular Rotation:** Automate the rotation of secrets on a regular basis to minimize the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging to track all access to secrets and monitor for suspicious activity.
*   **Secure Storage:** Ensure that your secrets management solution is properly secured and protected from unauthorized access.
*   **Don't Store Secrets in Code:** Never hardcode secrets directly into your application code or configuration files.
*   **Use Environment Variables (Carefully):**  While environment variables are better than hardcoding, consider them a stepping stone to a proper secret management system. Avoid storing highly sensitive secrets (e.g., database passwords) directly in environment variables if possible.  Use them for configuring the connection to Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
*   **Consider `passlib` or `bcrypt` for password hashing:** Use established hashing libraries if you are storing or managing passwords.
*   **Handle Exceptions:**  Properly handle exceptions when retrieving secrets, and have a fallback mechanism (e.g., a default configuration) in case the secrets management service is unavailable.

## Conclusion

Securely managing secrets is crucial for protecting your Pyramid applications from security breaches. By integrating with HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, you can centralize your secrets, enforce access control policies, and automate secrets rotation, significantly improving your application's security posture.  Choose the solution that best fits your environment and needs, and remember to follow best practices to ensure the ongoing security of your secrets.
