# Flask Application Deployment with Argo Rollouts: Canary Deployments, Metrics Analysis, and Observability

In the dynamic landscape of modern software development, continuous delivery and rapid iteration are paramount. Traditional deployment strategies, while functional, can be risky, potentially leading to service disruptions and negative user experiences. This is where advanced deployment strategies like Canary deployments come into play. Argo Rollouts, a Kubernetes controller, provides a sophisticated and robust framework for implementing these strategies. This blog post will guide you through deploying a Flask application to Kubernetes using Argo Rollouts, incorporating Canary deployments, metrics analysis with Prometheus, and essential observability practices.

## Why Argo Rollouts?

Argo Rollouts offers several key advantages over standard Kubernetes deployments:

- **Advanced Deployment Strategies:** Beyond RollingUpdate deployments, Argo Rollouts supports Canary, Blue/Green, and A/B testing strategies.
- **Progressive Delivery:** Rollouts allow you to gradually expose new versions of your application to a subset of users, mitigating risk.
- **Metrics-Driven Rollouts:** Rollouts can be automatically promoted or aborted based on the analysis of real-time metrics (e.g., error rates, latency).
- **Integration with Monitoring Tools:** Seamless integration with popular monitoring tools like Prometheus, Datadog, and New Relic.
- **Automated Rollback:** Rollouts automatically rollback to the previous stable version if analysis metrics indicate problems.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following set up:

- **Kubernetes Cluster:** A running Kubernetes cluster (Minikube, Kind, or a cloud provider like GKE, AKS, or EKS).
- **kubectl:** The Kubernetes command-line tool.
- **Argo Rollouts:** Installed in your Kubernetes cluster. Refer to the [Argo Rollouts Installation Guide](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/) for detailed instructions. You'll typically use `kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml`.
- **Prometheus:** Installed and configured in your Kubernetes cluster to collect metrics. Helm is a common way to install Prometheus.
- **A Basic Flask Application:** We'll use a simple Flask application as an example.

## Step 1: Creating a Simple Flask Application

Let's start by creating a basic Flask application. This application will expose a simple endpoint that returns a greeting. Create a file named `app.py`:

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    version = os.environ.get("VERSION", "v1")
    return jsonify({"message": f"Hello, World!  Version: {version}"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

This Flask application reads the `VERSION` environment variable to indicate the deployed version. This is crucial for canary deployments. Save this as `app.py`.

Next, create a `Dockerfile` to containerize our application:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY app.py .

ENV VERSION v1

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file specifying the dependencies:

```
Flask
```

Build and push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, Amazon ECR). Replace `<your-docker-username>` with your Docker Hub username (or equivalent):

```plaintext
docker build -t <your-docker-username>/flask-app:v1 .
docker push <your-docker-username>/flask-app:v1
```

## Step 2: Kubernetes Deployment and Service

Now, let's create the Kubernetes Deployment and Service for our Flask application. Create a file named `deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-app-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-app
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: flask-app
          image: <your-docker-username>/flask-app:v1 # Replace with your image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
          env:
            - name: VERSION
              value: v1
```

And create a `service.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flask-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: flask-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 5000
  type: LoadBalancer # Use ClusterIP if you don't need external access
```

Replace `<your-docker-username>/flask-app:v1` with the image you pushed in the previous step. Apply these manifests:

```plaintext
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

## Step 3: Defining the Argo Rollout

This is where the magic happens. We'll define an Argo Rollout to manage our deployments with a Canary strategy. Create a file named `rollout.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: flask-app-rollout
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: flask-app
          image: <your-docker-username>/flask-app:v1 # Replace with your image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
          env:
            - name: VERSION
              value: v1
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 10
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 30
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 70
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 100
      analysis:
        templates:
          - templateName: success-rate
        args:
          - name: service-name
            value: flask-app-service

  revisionHistoryLimit: 2
```

Let's break down this `rollout.yaml`:

- `apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1`: Specifies the Argo Rollouts API version.
- `kind: Rollout`: Defines a Rollout resource.
- `spec.replicas`: Specifies the desired number of replicas.
- `spec.selector`: Matches the labels of the pods managed by the Rollout.
- `spec.template`: Defines the pod template.
- `spec.strategy.canary`: Configures the Canary deployment strategy.
  - `steps`: Defines the progression of the Canary deployment.
    - `setWeight`: Sets the percentage of traffic routed to the new version.
    - `pause`: Pauses the Rollout for a specified duration, allowing you to monitor the Canary deployment.
  - `analysis`: Runs an analysis after the rollout is complete, to test the deployment.

This Rollout configuration performs a Canary deployment by gradually increasing the traffic to the new version in steps of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and then finally 100% with 1-minute pauses between each step. During these pauses, we want to analyse metrics. This is where `analysis` comes in.

## Step 4: Metrics Analysis with Prometheus

To enable metrics-driven rollouts, we need to define an `AnalysisTemplate` that uses Prometheus to query relevant metrics. Create a file named `analysis-template.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AnalysisTemplate
metadata:
  name: success-rate
spec:
  metrics:
    - name: success-rate
      interval: 30s
      successCondition: result[0].value >= 0.99
      failureLimit: 3
      provider:
        prometheus:
          address: http://prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090 # Adjust if your Prometheus is elsewhere
          query: |
            sum(rate(nginx_ingress_controller_requests{ingress="flask-app-service"}[1m]))
            /
            sum(rate(nginx_ingress_controller_requests{ingress="flask-app-service"}[1m]))
```

**Important Notes:**

- This `success-rate` analysis assumes you are using an Nginx Ingress Controller. You'll need to adjust the query to match the metrics exposed by your Ingress controller. If you are using different metrics, you will have to adjust the query.
- `successCondition`: This defines the criteria for a successful analysis. In this case, we require a success rate of at least 99%. Adjust this based on your application's requirements.
- `failureLimit`: The number of consecutive failed analysis runs before the rollout is automatically aborted.
- `address`: Ensure the Prometheus address is correct for your cluster. It's typically something like `http://prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090` if Prometheus is installed in the `monitoring` namespace.

Apply the AnalysisTemplate:

```plaintext
kubectl apply -f analysis-template.yaml
```

## Step 5: Deploying the Rollout and Monitoring

Now, let's deploy the Rollout:

```plaintext
kubectl apply -f rollout.yaml
```

You can monitor the Rollout's progress using the Argo Rollouts CLI or the Kubernetes dashboard:

```plaintext
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout flask-app-rollout
```

or

```plaintext
kubectl get rollout flask-app-rollout -w
```

This will show you the current state of the Rollout, including the traffic distribution and the results of the analysis.

## Step 6: Deploying a New Version

To deploy a new version of the application, update the `image` and `VERSION` environment variable in the `rollout.yaml` file. For example, let's update to version `v2`:

First, build and push a new version of your Docker image:

```plaintext
# Update app.py to reflect the new version
# For example, change:
# return jsonify({"message": f"Hello, World!  Version: {version}"})
# to:
# return jsonify({"message": f"Hello, World!  Version: {version} - This is V2!"})

docker build -t <your-docker-username>/flask-app:v2 .
docker push <your-docker-username>/flask-app:v2
```

Then, modify the `rollout.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: flask-app-rollout
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: flask-app
          image: <your-docker-username>/flask-app:v2 # Updated image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
          env:
            - name: VERSION
              value: v2 # Updated version
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 10
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 30
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 70
        - pause: { duration: 1m }
        - setWeight: 100
      analysis:
        templates:
          - templateName: success-rate
        args:
          - name: service-name
            value: flask-app-service

  revisionHistoryLimit: 2
```

Apply the updated Rollout:

```plaintext
kubectl apply -f rollout.yaml
```

Argo Rollouts will automatically start the Canary deployment process, gradually shifting traffic to the `v2` version while monitoring the metrics.

## Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect Prometheus Address:** Verify that the Prometheus address in the `analysis-template.yaml` file is correct.
- **Invalid Prometheus Query:** Ensure that the Prometheus query is valid and returns the expected metric. Use the Prometheus UI to test your queries.
- **Insufficient Permissions:** Ensure that Argo Rollouts has the necessary permissions to access Prometheus.
- **Rollout Stuck:** If the Rollout is stuck, check the logs of the Argo Rollouts controller for any errors. Use `kubectl logs -n argo-rollouts deployment/argo-rollouts`.
- **Metrics Not Being Collected:** Double-check that your Ingress controller is correctly configured to expose metrics to Prometheus.
- **ImagePullBackOff Errors:** Ensure the Kubernetes service account used by your pods has the necessary permissions to pull images from your container registry.

## Key Considerations for Production

- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for your application and the Argo Rollouts controller.
- **Traffic Management:** Consider using a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd for more advanced traffic management capabilities, such as request routing and fault injection.
- **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect your application and infrastructure.
- **Scalability:** Design your application and infrastructure to scale to meet the demands of your users.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your application and deployment pipeline before deploying to production. This should include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- **GitOps:** Implement a GitOps workflow to manage your deployments and configuration declaratively using Git.

## Conclusion

Argo Rollouts provides a powerful and flexible solution for implementing advanced deployment strategies for your Flask applications in Kubernetes. By incorporating Canary deployments, metrics analysis, and robust observability, you can significantly reduce the risk of deployments and ensure a smooth and reliable user experience. This example provides a foundational understanding; adapting the metrics and analysis to your specific application and infrastructure is crucial for successful implementation. Remember to monitor your deployments closely and iterate on your configuration to optimize performance and stability.
