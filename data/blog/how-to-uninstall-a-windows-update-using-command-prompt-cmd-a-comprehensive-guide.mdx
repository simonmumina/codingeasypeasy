# How to Uninstall a Windows Update Using Command Prompt (CMD): A Comprehensive Guide

Windows updates are crucial for maintaining a secure and stable operating system. However, sometimes an update can cause unexpected issues, such as software incompatibility, performance degradation, or even system instability. In such cases, uninstalling the problematic update can be a quick solution. This guide provides a step-by-step explanation of how to uninstall a Windows update using the Command Prompt (CMD).

## Why Use CMD to Uninstall Windows Updates?

While the Settings app offers a user-friendly interface for uninstalling updates, using CMD provides a few advantages:

*   **Efficiency:**  CMD can be faster for experienced users who know the KB number of the update they want to remove.
*   **Scripting & Automation:** CMD allows you to create scripts to automate the uninstallation process, which can be useful for managing multiple computers or performing repetitive tasks.
*   **Direct Control:** Using CMD gives you more direct control over the uninstallation process.
*   **Troubleshooting:**  In some rare cases, the graphical interface might fail to uninstall an update, and CMD can offer an alternative method.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **Administrator privileges:** You need administrator rights to run CMD and uninstall Windows updates.
*   **KB number of the update:**  You need to know the Knowledge Base (KB) number of the specific update you want to uninstall.  (e.g., KB5031354)

## Finding the KB Number of the Update

There are several ways to find the KB number of the problematic update:

**1. Using the Settings App:**

   *   Open **Settings** (Windows key + I).
   *   Click on **Windows Update**.
   *   Click on **Update history**.
   *   Scroll down to the "Uninstall updates" section.  This will take you to the old Control Panel view.
   *   The KB number will be listed next to the update name.

**2. Using the Control Panel (Older Windows Versions):**

   *   Open the **Control Panel**.
   *   Go to **Programs** > **Programs and Features**.
   *   In the left pane, click on **View installed updates**.
   *   The KB number will be listed next to the update name.

**3. Using PowerShell:**

   You can use PowerShell to list installed updates and their KB numbers:

   ```powershell
   Get-HotFix | Format-Table -AutoSize
   ```

   This command will display a table with information about all installed hotfixes, including their KB numbers.

## Uninstalling the Update Using CMD

Once you have the KB number, you can use the following command in CMD to uninstall the update:

```batch
wusa /uninstall /kb:KB1234567 /quiet
```

**Explanation of the command:**

*   `wusa`: This is the Windows Update Standalone Installer, a command-line tool used to install and uninstall updates.
*   `/uninstall`: This switch specifies that you want to uninstall an update.
*   `/kb:KB1234567`: Replace `KB1234567` with the actual KB number of the update you want to uninstall.  For example: `/kb:KB5031354`
*   `/quiet`: This switch runs the uninstallation process in silent mode, without displaying any prompts or messages to the user.  This is optional, but useful for automation.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**  Type "cmd" in the Windows search bar. Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator".  You *must* run CMD as an administrator, otherwise, the uninstall command will fail.
2.  **Type the command:**  Enter the command above, replacing `KB1234567` with the actual KB number of the update you want to uninstall.
3.  **Press Enter:** Execute the command.

   **Example:**

   To uninstall update KB5031354, you would use the following command:

   ```batch
   wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5031354 /quiet
   ```

4.  **Wait for the process to complete:** The uninstallation process may take some time, depending on the size and complexity of the update. If you didn't use the `/quiet` switch, you will see a progress bar.
5.  **Restart your computer:** After the uninstallation is complete, you will usually be prompted to restart your computer. Restarting is essential for the changes to take effect.  **Important:** Save your work before restarting!

## Removing the `/quiet` switch for User Interaction

If you want to see prompts and messages during the uninstallation process, simply remove the `/quiet` switch:

```batch
wusa /uninstall /kb:KB1234567
```

This will display a dialog box asking you to confirm the uninstallation.

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Uninstalling a problematic security update silently.**

Let's say update KB5030211 is causing issues with your network adapter. You want to uninstall it without any user interaction:

```batch
wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5030211 /quiet
```

**Scenario 2: Uninstalling an update and viewing prompts.**

You suspect update KB5031225 is causing software incompatibility. You want to uninstall it and see any prompts or messages:

```batch
wusa /uninstall /kb:KB5031225
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the uninstallation process, consider the following:

*   **Error code 0x80073701 (CBS_E_NOT_APPLICABLE):**  This error usually means the update is not installed on your system. Double-check the KB number.
*   **"Access is denied" error:**  Make sure you are running CMD as an administrator.
*   **The update cannot be uninstalled:** Some updates, especially cumulative updates and servicing stack updates (SSU), may be difficult or impossible to uninstall.
*   **System file corruption:** In rare cases, system file corruption can prevent updates from being uninstalled. Run the System File Checker (SFC) to scan for and repair corrupted system files:

    ```batch
    sfc /scannow
    ```

    After running SFC, restart your computer and try uninstalling the update again.
*   **DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management):** If SFC doesn't fix the issue, you can try using DISM to repair the Windows image:

    ```batch
    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
    ```

    This command requires an internet connection. After running DISM, restart your computer and try uninstalling the update again.
*   **Restart your computer before trying again:** Sometimes, simply restarting your computer can resolve temporary issues that prevent updates from being uninstalled.

## Preventing the Update from Reinstalling

After uninstalling the problematic update, Windows Update might automatically try to reinstall it.  To prevent this, you can use the "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter from Microsoft.  This tool allows you to block specific updates from being installed. You can download it from the Microsoft website by searching for "Show or hide updates troubleshooter".

## Conclusion

Uninstalling Windows updates via the Command Prompt offers a powerful and efficient way to resolve issues caused by faulty updates. By understanding the `wusa` command and following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively manage updates on your Windows system. Remember to always exercise caution when uninstalling updates, and create a system restore point before making any significant changes.
