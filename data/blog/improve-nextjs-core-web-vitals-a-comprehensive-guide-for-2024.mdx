# Improve Next.js Core Web Vitals: A Comprehensive Guide for 2024

Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that Google uses to evaluate the user experience of a webpage. Optimizing these metrics is crucial for achieving better search engine rankings and providing a seamless experience for your users. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to improve Core Web Vitals in your Next.js application. We'll cover key areas like code splitting, image optimization, font optimization, and much more, with practical code examples.

## What are Core Web Vitals?

Core Web Vitals consist of three primary metrics:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Measures the time it takes for the largest content element (usually an image or video) to become visible on the screen. Aim for an LCP of **2.5 seconds or less**.
- **First Input Delay (FID):** Measures the time it takes for the browser to respond to the first interaction the user makes with the page (e.g., clicking a button). Aim for an FID of **100 milliseconds or less**. Since Next.js is SSR, FID can be difficult to measure accurately in a lab environment, so Total Blocking Time (TBT) is used as a proxy in lab tests.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Measures the amount of unexpected layout shifts that occur during the loading of the page. Aim for a CLS of **0.1 or less**.

## Why are Core Web Vitals Important for Next.js?

- **SEO:** Google uses Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor. Improving your scores can directly impact your search engine visibility.
- **User Experience:** Faster loading times and a more stable layout lead to a better user experience, which translates to increased engagement, lower bounce rates, and higher conversion rates.
- **Mobile-First Indexing:** Google primarily uses the mobile version of a website for indexing and ranking. Optimizing for mobile performance is crucial, and Core Web Vitals play a significant role.

## Strategies to Improve Core Web Vitals in Next.js

### 1. Optimizing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

LCP is often the first metric to tackle. Here are several strategies:

- **Optimize Images:** Large, unoptimized images are a common cause of slow LCP.

  - **Use Next.js Image Component (`next/image`):** This component automatically optimizes images by resizing, compressing, and serving them in modern formats like WebP. It also provides built-in lazy loading.

    ```jsx
    import Image from 'next/image'

    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <Image
          src="/hero-image.jpg" // Replace with your image path
          alt="A beautiful hero image"
          width={1200} // Set the actual width of the image
          height={600} // Set the actual height of the image
          priority //  Indicates high priority (e.g., visible on the initial viewport)
        />
      )
    }

    export default MyComponent
    ```

    **Key Points:**

    - `priority`: Use this prop for images visible in the initial viewport to ensure they load eagerly.
    - `width` and `height`: Crucial for preventing layout shift by reserving space for the image.
    - `layout="fill"`: This prop is important to properly use the `objectFit` property.

  - **Image Optimization Tools:** Use tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG to further compress images before using them in your Next.js project.
  - **Choose the Right Image Format:** WebP generally offers superior compression and quality compared to JPEG or PNG.
  - **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load images that are not immediately visible in the viewport. The `next/image` component handles this automatically (except for images marked with `priority`).

- **Optimize Critical CSS:** Render only the CSS required for the initial viewport.

  - **CSS Modules/Styled Components:** Use CSS Modules or Styled Components to scope your CSS and avoid unnecessary styles.
  - **Purge Unused CSS:** Tools like PurgeCSS can remove unused CSS from your stylesheets.

  ```bash
  npm install -D purgecss
  ```

  Configure PurgeCSS in your `postcss.config.js`:

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    plugins: [
      'postcss-preset-env',
      ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
        ? [
            '@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss',
            {
              content: ['./pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
              defaultExtractor: (content) => content.match(/[\w-/:]+(?<!:)/g) || [],
            },
          ]
        : []),
    ],
  }
  ```

- **Optimize Server Response Times:** A slow server response time can significantly impact LCP.

  - **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Varnish) to serve static content more quickly.
  - **Optimize Database Queries:** Ensure your database queries are efficient and optimized.
  - **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Use a CDN to distribute your content geographically, reducing latency for users around the world.

- **Preload Important Resources:** Use `<link rel="preload">` to tell the browser to download critical resources early in the page load process. This is particularly helpful for fonts and key images.

  ```plaintext
  <head>
    <link
      rel="preload"
      href="/fonts/my-font.woff2"
      as="font"
      type="font/woff2"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
    <link rel="preload" href="/hero-image.jpg" as="image" type="image/jpeg" />
  </head>
  ```

- **Defer Non-Critical JavaScript:** Avoid blocking the main thread with long-running JavaScript tasks.

  - **Code Splitting (see section below):** Break down your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand.
  - **`next/dynamic`:** Use `next/dynamic` to load components lazily.
  - **Web Workers:** Offload CPU-intensive tasks to web workers to prevent blocking the main thread.

### 2. Improving First Input Delay (FID)

Reducing FID involves optimizing the main thread to ensure responsiveness to user interactions. Here are the key strategies:

- **Reduce JavaScript Execution Time:** Large JavaScript bundles are a common cause of high FID.

  - **Code Splitting:** Divide your code into smaller chunks and load them only when needed.
  - **Tree Shaking:** Eliminate unused code from your JavaScript bundles. Webpack (which Next.js uses) performs tree shaking automatically.
  - **Remove Unnecessary Dependencies:** Analyze your dependencies and remove any that are not essential. Tools like Bundle Analyzer can help.

    ```bash
    npm install -D webpack-bundle-analyzer
    ```

    Then, add the analyzer to your `next.config.js`:

    ```javascript
    const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
      enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
    })

    module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({})
    ```

    Run the analyzer by setting the `ANALYZE` environment variable:

    ```bash
    ANALYZE=true npm run build
    ```

- **Minimize Main Thread Work:** Keep the main thread free to handle user interactions.

  - **Defer Non-Critical Tasks:** Schedule non-critical tasks to run after the initial page load. Use `setTimeout` or `requestIdleCallback`.
  - **Web Workers:** Move computationally intensive tasks to web workers to avoid blocking the main thread. For example, image processing or complex calculations.

    ```javascript
    // In your component:
    useEffect(() => {
      const worker = new Worker('/my-worker.js') // Path to your worker file

      worker.postMessage({ data: 'some data' })

      worker.onmessage = (event) => {
        console.log('Received from worker:', event.data)
        // Update state with the result from the worker
      }

      return () => {
        worker.terminate() // Clean up when the component unmounts
      }
    }, [])

    // my-worker.js:
    self.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
      const data = event.data.data
      // Perform a complex calculation
      const result = performComplexCalculation(data)

      self.postMessage({ result })
    })
    ```

- **Optimize Third-Party JavaScript:** Third-party scripts (e.g., analytics, ads) can significantly impact FID.

  - **Load Third-Party Scripts Lazily:** Use `next/script` to load scripts asynchronously or defer their execution.

    ```jsx
    import Script from 'next/script'

    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <>
          <Script
            src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"
            strategy="beforeInteractive" // Load before hydration
          />
          <Script id="google-analytics" strategy="afterInteractive">
            {`
              window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
              function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
              gtag('js', new Date());
    
              gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
            `}
          </Script>
        </>
      )
    }

    export default MyComponent
    ```

    **`strategy` options:**

    - `beforeInteractive`: Load the script before the page becomes interactive. Suitable for scripts that need to run early, like analytics tracking.
    - `afterInteractive`: Load the script after the page becomes interactive. Suitable for scripts that are less critical and can be loaded later.
    - `lazyOnload`: Load the script when the browser is idle.

  - **Consider Alternatives:** Evaluate whether you truly need all your third-party scripts. Are there lighter alternatives available?
  - **Sandbox Third-Party Scripts:** If possible, run third-party scripts in a sandboxed environment to prevent them from interfering with the main thread.

- **Code splitting with `next/dynamic`:** Dynamically import modules (e.g. components or libraries) only when needed. This reduces the initial JavaScript payload.

  ```javascript
  import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

  const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'), {
    loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>, // Optional: Display a loading indicator
    ssr: false, // Optional: Disable server-side rendering for this component if it's purely client-side
  })

  function HomePage() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>This is the home page</p>
        <DynamicComponent />
      </div>
    )
  }

  export default HomePage
  ```

### 3. Reducing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

CLS measures visual stability. Unexpected layout shifts can be frustrating for users. Here's how to minimize CLS:

- **Reserve Space for Images and Videos:** Always specify `width` and `height` attributes for images and videos. The `next/image` component handles this automatically.

  ```plaintext
  <img src="my-image.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="My Image" />
  ```

  or using `next/image`

  ````jsx
  import Image from 'next/image';

      function MyComponent() {
        return (
          <Image
            src="/hero-image.jpg" // Replace with your image path
            alt="A beautiful hero image"
            width={1200} // Set the actual width of the image
            height={600} // Set the actual height of the image
            priority //  Indicates high priority (e.g., visible on the initial viewport)
          />
        );
      }

      export default MyComponent;
      ```

  This allows the browser to reserve the correct amount of space for the image before it loads, preventing layout shift.

  ````

- **Reserve Space for Ads:** Ads can often cause layout shifts. Pre-allocate space for ads to prevent content from jumping around when they load. Use placeholders or containers with fixed dimensions.
- **Avoid Inserting Content Above Existing Content:** Avoid inserting new content above existing content, especially after the initial page load. If you must do so, ensure it's done in a way that minimizes layout shift (e.g., using transitions).
- **Use CSS Transforms Instead of Layout-Triggering Properties:** Use CSS `transform` property for animations and positioning instead of properties like `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height`, which trigger layout recalculations. `transform` changes are generally less expensive.
- **Avoid Font Swaps (FOUT/FOIT):** Font swaps (Flash of Unstyled Text or Flash of Invisible Text) can cause significant layout shifts.

  - **Preload Fonts:** Use `<link rel="preload">` to preload your fonts.
  - **Use `font-display: optional`:** This allows the browser to use a system font initially and swap to the custom font when it's ready, preventing FOIT and minimizing FOUT.

    ```plaintext
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'MyFont';
      src: url('/fonts/my-font.woff2') format('woff2');
      font-display: optional;
    }
    ```

  - **Use `next/font`:** Next.js 13 and later have introduced `next/font`, which optimizes font loading, helping avoid layout shifts caused by font swaps. This handles automatic self-hosting, preloading, and setting the correct `font-display` value.

    ```jsx
    import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

    const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en" className={inter.className}>
          <body>{children}</body>
        </html>
      )
    }
    ```

### 4. Font Optimization

As mentioned above, font optimization is crucial for both LCP and CLS.

- **Use Web Fonts Sparingly:** Limit the number of web fonts you use, as they can increase page load time.
- **Choose Font Formats Wisely:** Use WOFF2, as it offers the best compression and browser support.
- **Self-Host Fonts:** Hosting fonts on your own server can often be faster than using a third-party service. This gives you more control over caching and delivery. As mentioned, `next/font` does this automatically.
- **Font Subsetting:** Use font subsetting to include only the characters you need in your font files. This reduces file size.
- **`next/font`:** Next.js 13+ offers a dedicated `next/font` API to import and optimize fonts. It automatically self-hosts the fonts, applies the best `font-display` strategy, and preloads the fonts for optimal performance. This is the recommended way to use fonts in modern Next.js applications.

### 5. Code Splitting in Detail

Code splitting is the practice of breaking down your JavaScript code into smaller bundles that can be loaded independently. Next.js supports several forms of code splitting:

- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically code-splits your application based on routes. Each page in your `pages/` directory becomes a separate bundle.
- **Dynamic Imports (`next/dynamic`):** Use `next/dynamic` to load components or modules on demand. This is especially useful for large components that are not immediately needed. See the FID section for example code.

- **Component-Level Code Splitting:** Break down large components into smaller, more manageable components, which facilitates independent loading.

### 6. Leveraging Next.js Features

Next.js provides several built-in features that can help improve Core Web Vitals:

- **Automatic Image Optimization:** As discussed earlier, the `next/image` component automatically optimizes images.
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Next.js splits your code into smaller chunks based on routes.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG):** SSR and SSG can improve LCP by delivering pre-rendered HTML to the browser. SSG is generally faster for content that doesn't change frequently. Next.js supports both SSG (using `getStaticProps`) and SSR (using `getServerSideProps`). Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update statically generated pages in the background, striking a balance between performance and freshness.

  ```javascript
  // getStaticProps (SSG) - Ideal for static content
  export async function getStaticProps() {
    const data = await fetchData() // Fetch data from an API
    return {
      props: {
        data,
      },
      revalidate: 60, // Optional: Regenerate the page every 60 seconds (ISR)
    }
  }

  // getServerSideProps (SSR) - Useful when content changes frequently
  export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
    const data = await fetchData() // Fetch data from an API
    return {
      props: {
        data,
      },
    }
  }
  ```

- **Middleware:** Use Next.js Middleware to intercept requests and perform tasks like redirecting users based on their location or device. Middleware can be used to optimize performance by serving different assets based on user agent.
- **`next/script`:** Control how and when third-party scripts are loaded. See the FID section for example code.

### 7. Monitoring and Measurement

It's essential to monitor your Core Web Vitals to track your progress and identify areas for improvement.

- **Google PageSpeed Insights:** Provides detailed reports on your website's performance, including Core Web Vitals.
- **Lighthouse:** A Chrome DevTools tool that provides audits for performance, accessibility, SEO, and more.
- **Web Vitals Chrome Extension:** Displays Core Web Vitals metrics in real-time as you browse your website.
- **Google Search Console:** Provides aggregated Core Web Vitals data for your website.
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Use a RUM tool (e.g., WebPageTest, New Relic Browser, Sentry) to collect performance data from real users. This gives you a more accurate picture of how your website performs in the real world.

### 8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Large JavaScript Bundles:** Over-reliance on large JavaScript libraries without proper code splitting is a common performance bottleneck.
- **Unoptimized Images:** Not optimizing images for the web is a significant performance killer.
- **Blocking Resources:** Resources that block the main thread can significantly impact FID and LCP.
- **Lack of Caching:** Not implementing caching can lead to slow server response times and repeated downloads of static assets.
- **Ignoring Third-Party Scripts:** Failing to optimize third-party scripts can have a negative impact on all Core Web Vitals.

## Conclusion

Improving Core Web Vitals in your Next.js application is an ongoing process. By implementing the strategies outlined in this guide, you can significantly improve your website's performance, user experience, and SEO. Regularly monitor your metrics and adapt your optimization strategies as needed to stay ahead of the curve. Good luck optimizing!
