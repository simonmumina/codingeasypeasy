# How to Use Third-Party UI Component Libraries in Next.js (Material UI, Ant Design, etc.)

Next.js is a powerful React framework for building performant and SEO-friendly web applications. One of the most common requirements when building a modern web app is using a UI component library to accelerate development and provide a consistent look and feel. This guide will walk you through integrating popular UI libraries like Material UI and Ant Design into your Next.js projects, addressing common challenges and best practices along the way.

## Why Use a UI Component Library in Next.js?

Using a UI component library in Next.js offers several advantages:

- **Faster Development:** Pre-built, reusable components save you from writing everything from scratch.
- **Consistent Design:** Ensures a uniform and professional look across your application.
- **Accessibility:** Many libraries prioritize accessibility (a11y) features out of the box.
- **Maintainability:** Component libraries are typically well-maintained and updated.
- **Performance:** Optimized components contribute to better application performance.

## Choosing the Right UI Component Library

Several excellent UI component libraries are available for React. Here are a few popular choices and factors to consider when selecting one:

- **Material UI (MUI):** Implements Google's Material Design specification. Offers a vast collection of components, extensive customization options, and a large community.
- **Ant Design:** A popular choice, particularly for enterprise applications, known for its comprehensive set of components, strong theming capabilities, and well-documented API.
- **Chakra UI:** Focuses on accessibility and developer experience. Provides a flexible and composable component system with a strong emphasis on styling.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes for styling your components. While not a component library in the traditional sense, it's often used in conjunction with headless UI libraries like Headless UI or Radix UI, allowing for complete control over component structure and styling.

Consider these factors when choosing:

- **Design Style:** Does the library's design language align with your project's aesthetic?
- **Component Set:** Does it offer the components you need for your application?
- **Customization:** How flexible is the library in terms of customization and theming?
- **Bundle Size:** What is the impact on your application's bundle size?
- **Community Support:** Is there a large and active community for help and resources?
- **Accessibility:** Does the library provide accessible components out of the box?
- **Documentation:** Is the documentation comprehensive and easy to understand?

## Integrating Material UI into Next.js

Let's walk through integrating Material UI into a Next.js project.

### 1. Create a New Next.js Project (if you don't have one already)

```plaintext
npx create-next-app@latest my-mui-app
cd my-mui-app
```

### 2. Install Material UI Packages

Install the core Material UI components, the styled engine (Emotion or Styled Components), and the icons package. We'll use Emotion for this example.

```plaintext
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
```

### 3. Configure `_document.js` for Server-Side Rendering

Next.js performs server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO. Material UI requires special handling during SSR to inject CSS correctly. Create (or modify if it exists) `pages/_document.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
import createEmotionServer from '@emotion/server/create-instance'
import { CacheProvider } from '@emotion/react'
import createEmotionCache from '../src/createEmotionCache' // See step 5.

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en">
        <Head>
          {/* PWA primary color */}
          <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />
          <link
            rel="stylesheet"
            href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
          />
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" />
          {this.props.emotionStyleTags}
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}

// `getInitialProps` belongs to `_document` (instead of `_app`),
// it's compatible with static-site generation (SSG).
MyDocument.getInitialProps = async (ctx) => {
  // Resolution order
  //
  // On the server:
  // 1. app.getInitialProps
  // 2. page.getInitialProps
  // 3. document.getInitialProps
  // 4. app.render
  // 5. page.render
  //
  // On the server with error:
  // 1. document.getInitialProps
  // 2. app.render
  // 3. page.render
  //
  // On the client
  // 1. app.getInitialProps
  // 2. page.getInitialProps
  // 3. app.render
  // 4. page.render

  const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage

  // You can do whatever you want in here, including potentially
  // caching the result.
  const cache = createEmotionCache()
  const { extractCriticalToChunks } = createEmotionServer(cache)

  ctx.renderPage = () =>
    originalRenderPage({
      enhanceApp: (App) => (props) => (
        <CacheProvider value={cache}>
          <App {...props} />
        </CacheProvider>
      ),
    })

  const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)
  // This is important. It prevents emotion to render invalid HTML.
  // See https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/26561#issuecomment-855286153
  const emotionStyles = extractCriticalToChunks(initialProps.html)
  const emotionStyleTags = emotionStyles.styles.map((style) => (
    <style
      data-emotion={`${style.key} ${style.ids.join(' ')}`}
      key={style.key}
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: style.css }}
    />
  ))

  return {
    ...initialProps,
    emotionStyleTags,
  }
}
```

### 4. Configure `_app.js`

Create (or modify) `pages/_app.js` to wrap your application with `CacheProvider` component from `@emotion/react`. This ensures that Material UI's styling is properly applied across your application.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
import Head from 'next/head'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles'
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline'
import { CacheProvider } from '@emotion/react'
import theme from '../src/theme' // See Step 6
import createEmotionCache from '../src/createEmotionCache' // See Step 5

// Client-side cache, shared for the whole session of the user in the browser.
const clientSideEmotionCache = createEmotionCache()

export default function MyApp(props) {
  const { Component, emotionCache = clientSideEmotionCache, pageProps } = props

  return (
    <CacheProvider value={emotionCache}>
      <Head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width" />
      </Head>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        {/* CssBaseline kickstart an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon. */}
        <CssBaseline />
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </CacheProvider>
  )
}

MyApp.propTypes = {
  Component: PropTypes.elementType.isRequired,
  emotionCache: PropTypes.object,
  pageProps: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
}
```

### 5. Create `src/createEmotionCache.js`

Create a file `src/createEmotionCache.js` to configure the Emotion cache. This is used for server-side rendering to prevent CSS conflicts.

```javascript
import createCache from '@emotion/cache'

const createEmotionCache = () => {
  return createCache({ key: 'css', prepend: true })
}

export default createEmotionCache
```

### 6. Create `src/theme.js` (Optional - for Customization)

You can customize the Material UI theme by creating a `src/theme.js` file:

```javascript
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles'
import { red } from '@mui/material/colors'

// Create a theme instance.
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#556cd6',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#19857b',
    },
    error: {
      main: red.A400,
    },
  },
})

export default theme
```

### 7. Use Material UI Components in Your Pages

Now you can import and use Material UI components in your Next.js pages. For example, in `pages/index.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import Button from '@mui/material/Button'
import Typography from '@mui/material/Typography'
import Container from '@mui/material/Container'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Container maxWidth="sm">
      <Typography variant="h4" component="h1" gutterBottom>
        Welcome to My Material UI App!
      </Typography>
      <Button variant="contained" color="primary">
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </Container>
  )
}
```

### 8. Run Your Development Server

```plaintext
npm run dev
```

You should now see your Next.js application with Material UI components rendered correctly.

## Integrating Ant Design into Next.js

Integrating Ant Design into your Next.js project follows a similar process.

### 1. Create a New Next.js Project (if needed)

```plaintext
npx create-next-app@latest my-antd-app
cd my-antd-app
```

### 2. Install Ant Design

```plaintext
npm install antd
```

### 3. Configure `_app.js` for Ant Design Styles

Import Ant Design's CSS globally in your `pages/_app.js` file. Create or modify `pages/_app.js`:

```javascript
import '../styles/globals.css'
import 'antd/dist/reset.css' // or 'antd/dist/antd.less'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

**Important:** The `antd/dist/reset.css` import is crucial. Ant Design's styling relies on a baseline CSS reset to ensure consistent rendering across browsers. Using `antd/dist/antd.less` requires a less preprocessor setup. The easiest approach is the `reset.css`.

### 4. Use Ant Design Components

Now you can import and use Ant Design components in your pages. For example, in `pages/index.js`:

```javascript
import { Button, Typography } from 'antd'
import { Container } from '@mui/material' // Optional Material UI import.

const { Title } = Typography

function Home() {
  return (
    <Container maxWidth="sm">
      <Title level={2}>Welcome to My Ant Design App!</Title>
      <Button type="primary">Click Me</Button>
    </Container>
  )
}

export default Home
```

### 5. Run Your Development Server

```plaintext
npm run dev
```

You should see your Next.js app with Ant Design components.

## Considerations for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Styling

- **CSS-in-JS vs. CSS Modules:** Libraries like Material UI heavily rely on CSS-in-JS (Emotion, Styled Components) while Ant Design primarily uses CSS (or Less). Both approaches can work well in Next.js, but it's essential to configure them correctly for SSR. The examples above provide basic SSR setup for each.
- **Critical CSS:** For optimal performance, consider extracting critical CSS (the CSS required to render the initial view of your page) and inlining it in the `<head>` of your HTML. Tools like `critters` or `next-purgecss` can help automate this process.
- **Theme Customization:** Most UI libraries provide theming capabilities. Take advantage of these to tailor the library's appearance to your project's brand. Refer to each library's documentation for specific instructions.
- **Client-Side Hydration:** Ensure that the styles applied during server-side rendering match the styles applied on the client-side during hydration. Mismatches can cause visual flicker or layout shifts. The `_document.js` and `_app.js` configurations presented earlier are critical for this.
- **Bundle Size Optimization:** Be mindful of the bundle size impact of your chosen UI library. Consider using tree-shaking (supported by most modern build tools) to remove unused components and styles. Libraries like Material UI offer modular imports that can help reduce bundle size.
- **Accessibility:** Always prioritize accessibility. Check that the UI components you are using are accessible and provide appropriate ARIA attributes. Test your application with assistive technologies to ensure a good user experience for everyone.

## Best Practices

- **Consistent Styling:** Establish a consistent styling approach across your application to maintain a unified look and feel. Use a theme to manage colors, typography, and spacing.
- **Component Composition:** Leverage component composition to create reusable UI elements that are tailored to your specific needs.
- **Avoid Over-Customization:** While customization is powerful, avoid over-customizing components. Stick to the library's intended usage patterns as much as possible to ensure maintainability and compatibility with future updates.
- **Stay Updated:** Keep your UI library and related dependencies up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. Regularly review the library's release notes.
- **Follow Documentation:** Refer to the official documentation of your chosen UI library for detailed information on components, APIs, and best practices.

## Conclusion

Integrating third-party UI component libraries into your Next.js projects can significantly accelerate development and improve the user experience. By following the steps outlined in this guide and keeping the considerations for SSR and styling in mind, you can successfully leverage the power of Material UI, Ant Design, and other libraries to build robust and visually appealing web applications. Remember to choose the library that best aligns with your project's needs, prioritize accessibility, and maintain a consistent styling approach.
