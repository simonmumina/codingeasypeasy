# BootstrapVue vs Vue-Bootstrap-Next: Choosing the Best Vue.js Bootstrap 5 Library

Bootstrap is a hugely popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. Vue.js, on the other hand, is a progressive JavaScript framework known for its ease of use and component-based architecture. Combining the power of these two frameworks leads to rapid development and visually appealing user interfaces. But how do you integrate Bootstrap 5 seamlessly into your Vue.js projects? That's where Vue Bootstrap component libraries come in.

This article dives deep into two of the most prominent contenders: **BootstrapVue** and **Vue-Bootstrap-Next**. We'll compare their features, syntax, performance, community support, and suitability for different project types to help you make an informed decision.

## Why Use a Vue Bootstrap Library?

Before we dive into the specifics of each library, let's understand why using a Vue Bootstrap library is beneficial:

- **Rapid Development:** Pre-built components save you time and effort by providing ready-to-use UI elements like buttons, modals, forms, and more.
- **Consistency:** Ensure a consistent look and feel across your application by leveraging Bootstrap's established design system.
- **Responsiveness:** Bootstrap's responsive grid system and components ensure your application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** Many Bootstrap components are designed with accessibility in mind, helping you create inclusive web applications.
- **Community Support:** Bootstrap has a large and active community, providing ample resources and support.

## Introducing BootstrapVue

BootstrapVue, while initially designed for Bootstrap 4, offers a (sometimes indirect or community-driven) way to leverage Bootstrap components within your Vue.js applications. It provides a comprehensive set of components that are designed to be reactive and data-driven, seamlessly integrating with Vue's reactivity system.

**Key Features of BootstrapVue:**

- **Wide Range of Components:** Offers a comprehensive suite of Bootstrap components, from basic buttons and forms to more complex elements like carousels and tables.
- **Reactive Components:** Components are designed to be reactive, meaning they automatically update when the underlying data changes.
- **Accessibility Support:** Many components include built-in accessibility features, adhering to ARIA standards.
- **Customization Options:** Allows for customization through props, slots, and CSS overrides.
- **Directive-Based:** Utilizes directives for certain functionality, such as tooltips and popovers.

**Code Example (Button):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button variant="primary">Primary Button</b-button>
    <b-button variant="success">Success Button</b-button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { BButton } from 'bootstrap-vue'

export default {
  components: {
    BButton
  }
}
</script>
```

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install bootstrap-vue bootstrap@^4.0.0
# OR
yarn add bootstrap-vue bootstrap@^4.0.0
```

**Important Note:** BootstrapVue officially supports Bootstrap 4. Using it with Bootstrap 5 requires some workarounds and may not be a perfect experience. This is a key distinction to be aware of. There are community maintained ports for Bootstrap 5 which are worth checking before writing off this fantastic library.

## Introducing Vue-Bootstrap-Next

Vue-Bootstrap-Next is a more recent library specifically designed to work with Bootstrap 5. It provides a similar set of components to BootstrapVue but is built from the ground up to leverage the features and improvements of Bootstrap 5. This includes better support for accessibility and a cleaner, more modern codebase. It is a maintained library, so you are more likely to get updates as well.

**Key Features of Vue-Bootstrap-Next:**

- **Bootstrap 5 Native:** Built specifically for Bootstrap 5, ensuring full compatibility and taking advantage of its features.
- **Modern Codebase:** Utilizes modern JavaScript practices and a cleaner codebase, potentially leading to better performance.
- **Composable Components:** Offers a flexible and composable component architecture, allowing for easier customization and extension.
- **TypeScript Support:** Provides excellent TypeScript support, making it a good choice for larger projects that benefit from static typing.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind, with components adhering to modern ARIA standards.

**Code Example (Button):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <BButton variant="primary">Primary Button</BButton>
    <BButton variant="success">Success Button</BButton>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { BButton } from 'vue-bootstrap-next'
</script>
```

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install vue-bootstrap-next bootstrap@^5.0.0
# OR
yarn add vue-bootstrap-next bootstrap@^5.0.0
```

While both libraries are generally performant, there are some nuances to consider. Vue-Bootstrap-Next, with its modern codebase, may offer slightly better performance, especially in larger applications with many components. However, BootstrapVue is well-optimized. It's always a good idea to profile your application to identify any performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly. Lazy loading components is something you can always investigate.

## Community Support and Documentation

BootstrapVue has a larger and more established community due to its longer history. However, the Vue-Bootstrap-Next community is growing rapidly. Both libraries have comprehensive documentation, but Vue-Bootstrap-Next's documentation may be more up-to-date and relevant to Bootstrap 5. Check github to see what issues are open or closed, and look at the last commit dates.

## Conclusion

Both BootstrapVue and Vue-Bootstrap-Next are excellent choices for integrating Bootstrap 5 into your Vue.js applications. However, **Vue-Bootstrap-Next is generally the better option for new projects that require native Bootstrap 5 support, excellent TypeScript support, and a modern codebase.** BootstrapVue remains a viable option for existing projects that are already using it, but be aware of the potential challenges and workarounds involved in using it with Bootstrap 5.

Ultimately, the best way to decide which library is right for you is to try them both out and see which one fits your workflow and project requirements best. Remember to consider the long-term maintainability of your project and the availability of support and updates when making your decision. Good luck!
