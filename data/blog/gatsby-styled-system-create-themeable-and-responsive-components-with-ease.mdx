# Gatsby Styled System: Create Themeable & Responsive Components with Ease

Building and maintaining consistent UI across a large Gatsby project can be a challenge. Manually handling responsive styles, theme variations, and ensuring design consistency across your components can quickly become cumbersome. That's where Styled System comes to the rescue.

Styled System is a collection of utility functions that let you define styles based on design system tokens and leverage responsive design breakpoints. Combined with Gatsby, it provides a powerful way to create scalable, maintainable, and themable React components. This blog post will guide you through implementing Styled System in your Gatsby project, from setting up the necessary dependencies to creating your own styled components.

## What is Styled System?

Styled System is a library that leverages the power of CSS-in-JS, specifically designed to work with design systems. It allows you to define style props that are responsive and based on your theme. This promotes a design-first approach and streamlines the styling process.

Key benefits of using Styled System:

- **Themeable:** Easily switch between different themes by changing the values in your theme object.
- **Responsive:** Define different styles for different screen sizes.
- **Composable:** Compose styles together using style props.
- **Maintainable:** Centralized design tokens and styles make maintaining your codebase easier.
- **Consistent:** Enforces a consistent design language across your application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** (Ideally, use the latest LTS version)
- **npm** or **yarn:** (Package managers)
- **Gatsby CLI:** `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

## Setting up Your Gatsby Project

If you don't already have a Gatsby project, create one using the following command:

```plaintext
gatsby new my-styled-system-project
cd my-styled-system-project
```

## Installing Dependencies

We'll need to install `styled-components`, `styled-system`, and potentially `theme-ui` (if you want a more comprehensive theming solution) as dependencies. `styled-components` is the CSS-in-JS library that Styled System uses under the hood. `theme-ui` provides a complete design system implementation built on top of Styled System.

```plaintext
npm install styled-components styled-system theme-ui @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

or with yarn:

```plaintext
yarn add styled-components styled-system theme-ui @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

- **`styled-components`:** For CSS-in-JS styling.
- **`styled-system`:** The core library for theme-aware styling.
- **`theme-ui`:** (Optional) A design system library built on Styled System (provides a more structured way to manage your theme).
- **`@emotion/react` & `@emotion/styled`:** Emotion is used as the underlying styling engine by Theme UI, hence the installation.

## Configuring `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`

To enable `styled-components` in your Gatsby project, you need to install and configure the `gatsby-plugin-styled-components` plugin.

```plaintext
npm install gatsby-plugin-styled-components
```

Then, add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-styled-components',
    // ... other plugins
  ],
}
```

## Creating a Theme

The theme is a JavaScript object that defines the styles and values used throughout your application. This includes colors, fonts, breakpoints, spacing, and more. Let's create a `theme.js` file in your `src` directory.

```plaintext
// src/theme.js
const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#007bff',
    secondary: '#6c757d',
    light: '#f8f9fa',
    dark: '#343a40',
    success: '#28a745',
    error: '#dc3545',
    warning: '#ffc107',
    info: '#17a2b8',
  },
  space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256],
  fontSizes: [12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64],
  fonts: {
    body: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
    heading: 'inherit',
    monospace: 'Menlo, monospace',
  },
  fontWeights: {
    body: 400,
    heading: 700,
    bold: 700,
  },
  lineHeights: {
    body: 1.5,
    heading: 1.25,
  },
  breakpoints: ['40em', '52em', '64em'], // sm, md, lg
}

export default theme
```

This theme object defines:

- **`colors`**: A palette of colors to use in your application.
- **`space`**: An array of spacing values (used for margins, padding, etc.). These values are typically used as multiples of a base unit (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px). Styled System will automatically scale these values based on the unit (e.g., providing `space={2}` will apply 8px of spacing).
- **`fontSizes`**: An array of font sizes. Similar to spacing, these are indexed for easier use.
- **`fonts`**: Font families to use.
- **`fontWeights`**: Font weights.
- **`lineHeights`**: Line heights.
- **`breakpoints`**: Breakpoints for responsive design. These are defined using CSS media queries.

## Using ThemeProvider in Gatsby

To make the theme available to your components, you need to wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` from `styled-components` (or the `ThemeProvider` from `theme-ui` if you're using that). The best place to do this is in your `gatsby-browser.js` file.

```plaintext
// gatsby-browser.js
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components' // or import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui';
import theme from './src/theme'

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{element}</ThemeProvider>
)
```

This wraps your entire application with the `ThemeProvider`, making the `theme` object available to all components.

## Creating Styled Components with Styled System

Now, let's create a styled component that utilizes Styled System.

```plaintext
// src/components/Button.js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { space, fontSize, fontWeight, color, buttonStyle } from 'styled-system'

const Button = styled.button`
  ${space}
  ${fontSize}
  ${fontWeight}
  ${color}
  ${buttonStyle}
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  transition: background-color 0.2s ease-in-out;

  &:hover {
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
`

Button.defaultProps = {
  fontSize: 2,
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  color: 'white',
  bg: 'primary',
  buttonStyle: 'primary', // You'll need to define different buttonStyles within the theme or directly within styled-components
}

export default Button
```

In this example:

- We import `styled` from `styled-components`.
- We import the necessary style functions from `styled-system`: `space`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `color`, and `buttonStyle`.
- We create a styled `button` component using `styled.button`.
- We apply the style functions using tagged template literals: `${space}`, `${fontSize}`, etc.
- We define default props on the `Button` component.

Now, you can use the `Button` component in your pages or components.

```plaintext
// src/pages/index.js
import React from 'react'
import Button from '../components/Button'

const IndexPage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to my Gatsby site!</h1>
    <Button m={3} fontSize={4} bg="secondary">
      Click Me!
    </Button>
    <Button m={3} fontSize={[2, 3, 4]} bg="success" color="dark">
      Responsive Button
    </Button>
  </div>
)

export default IndexPage
```

In this example:

- We import the `Button` component.
- We use the `space` prop (`m={3}`) to add margin around the button. `m` is a shortcut for `margin`. Since `space` in our theme is an array, `m={3}` will apply `space[3]` (which is 16px).
- We use the `fontSize` prop (`fontSize={4}`) to set the font size. Again, this maps to `fontSizes[4]` in the theme (which is 24px).
- We use the `bg` prop to set the background color using the `colors` from our theme. `bg="secondary"` will use the color defined as `theme.colors.secondary`.
- For the "Responsive Button", we use an array for the `fontSize` prop. This allows us to specify different font sizes for different breakpoints. In this case, the font size will be `fontSizes[2]` (16px) for the smallest breakpoint, `fontSizes[3]` (20px) for the medium breakpoint, and `fontSizes[4]` (24px) for the largest breakpoint.

## More Styled System Utilities

Styled System provides a variety of utility functions for different CSS properties. Here are some of the most commonly used:

- **`space`**: For margin and padding. Shorthands like `m`, `mt`, `mr`, `mb`, `ml`, `mx`, `my`, `p`, `pt`, `pr`, `pb`, `pl`, `px`, `py` are available.
- **`color`**: For color, background color, and other color-related properties. Shorthands like `color`, `bg`.
- **`typography`**: For font-size, font-weight, line-height, and other typography-related properties. Shorthands like `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`.
- **`layout`**: For width, height, display, and other layout-related properties. Shorthands like `width`, `height`, `display`.
- **`flexbox`**: For flexbox properties like `alignItems`, `justifyContent`, `flexDirection`.
- **`grid`**: For grid properties like `gridGap`, `gridColumn`, `gridRow`.
- **`border`**: For border properties like `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, `borderColor`.
- **`shadow`**: For box-shadow.
- **`position`**: For position, top, right, bottom, left, z-index.

Refer to the [Styled System documentation](https://styled-system.com/) for a complete list and detailed usage instructions.

## Advanced Theming with Theme UI (Optional)

While Styled System provides a great foundation, `theme-ui` offers a more comprehensive solution for managing your design system. It builds on top of Styled System and provides additional features like:

- **Theme specification:** A structured way to define your theme.
- **MDX support:** Use theme variables directly in your MDX content.
- **Component library:** A set of pre-built components that are styled according to your theme.

To use Theme UI, install it as described above, then adjust your `gatsby-browser.js` file. You may need to adjust your component implementations slightly to use the `sx` prop instead of direct styling. For example:

```plaintext
// src/components/Box.js
import React from 'react'
import { Box as ThemeUIBox } from 'theme-ui'

const Box = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  return <ThemeUIBox {...props}>{children}</ThemeUIBox>
}

export default Box
```

And then use this `Box` component, leveraging the `sx` prop, in your pages.

```plaintext
// src/pages/index.js
import React from 'react'
import Box from '../components/Box'

const IndexPage = () => (
  <Box
    sx={{
      bg: 'primary',
      color: 'white',
      p: 3,
      fontSize: [2, 3, 4], // Responsive font size
    }}
  >
    Hello Theme UI!
  </Box>
)

export default IndexPage
```
