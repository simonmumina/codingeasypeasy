# JavaScript `Object.assign()`: A Comprehensive Guide to Object Copying and Merging

`Object.assign()` is a powerful and versatile method in JavaScript that allows you to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It's a fundamental tool for object manipulation and is heavily used in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, especially when dealing with immutability and state management. This blog post will delve deep into `Object.assign()`, exploring its usage, nuances, and best practices.

## What is `Object.assign()`?

The `Object.assign()` method takes two or more arguments:

```plaintext
Object.assign(target, ...sources);
```

- **`target`:** The target object, to which the source properties will be copied. This object _will be mutated_.
- **`...sources`:** One or more source objects whose properties will be copied to the `target` object. If properties with the same name exist in multiple source objects, the properties from later sources will overwrite the properties from earlier sources.

The method returns the modified `target` object.

## Basic Usage: Copying Properties from One Object to Another

The most basic use case is copying properties from a single source object to a target object.

```plaintext
const target = {};
const source = { a: 1, b: 2 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target);       // Output: { a: 1, b: 2 }
console.log(returnedTarget); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2 }
console.log(target === returnedTarget); // Output: true
```

In this example, the properties `a` and `b` from the `source` object are copied to the `target` object. Importantly, the `target` object is modified directly, and the `returnedTarget` variable is simply a reference to the same, modified `target` object.

## Merging Multiple Objects

`Object.assign()` shines when you need to merge multiple objects into a single object.

```plaintext
const obj1 = { a: 1 };
const obj2 = { b: 2 };
const obj3 = { c: 3 };

const mergedObject = Object.assign(obj1, obj2, obj3);

console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
console.log(obj1);       // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }  obj1 is mutated!
```

Here, the properties from `obj2` and `obj3` are merged into `obj1`. Again, `obj1` is modified directly.

## Overwriting Properties

When multiple source objects have the same property, the property value from the later source object will overwrite the earlier ones.

```plaintext
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };
const obj3 = { a: 5 };

const mergedObject = Object.assign(obj1, obj2, obj3);

console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { a: 5, b: 3, c: 4 }
console.log(obj1);       // Output: { a: 5, b: 3, c: 4 } obj1 is mutated!
```

Notice how the `a` property is ultimately set to `5` (from `obj3`), and the `b` property is set to `3` (from `obj2`).

## Creating a New Object (Shallow Copy)

If you want to avoid mutating the target object, you can pass an empty object (`{}`) as the target. This effectively creates a new object with the combined properties.

```plaintext
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };

const newObject = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);

console.log(newObject); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
console.log(obj1);      // Output: { a: 1, b: 2 } (unchanged)
console.log(obj2);      // Output: { c: 3, d: 4 } (unchanged)
```

This creates a new object `newObject` that contains all the properties from `obj1` and `obj2` without modifying the original objects. **Important:** This is a _shallow_ copy, as we'll discuss next.

## Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy

`Object.assign()` performs a **shallow copy**. This means that it copies the _references_ to object properties, not the values themselves. If a property is a primitive (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol), the value is copied. However, if a property is an object or array, the _reference_ to that object or array is copied.

Consider this example:

```plaintext
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1);

console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }

obj1.b.c = 3; // Modify the nested object in obj1

console.log(obj1); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } }
console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } }  obj2 is also affected!
```

Even though we modified `obj1.b.c`, `obj2.b.c` also changed because `obj1.b` and `obj2.b` are references to the _same_ object in memory.

**When do you need a deep copy?**

You need a deep copy when you want to create a completely independent copy of an object, including all nested objects and arrays. Modifying the original object should not affect the copied object, and vice-versa.

**How to perform a deep copy?**

`Object.assign()` is _not_ suitable for deep copying. You'll need to use other methods:

- **`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))`:** This is a common and relatively simple approach, but it has limitations. It won't work with functions, `undefined`, `Date` objects (they'll be converted to strings), regular expressions, and circular references.

  ```plaintext
  const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 }, d: new Date() };
  const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));

  obj1.b.c = 3;
  console.log(obj1); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 3 }, d: 2024-02-29T00:00:00.000Z }
  console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 2 }, d: "2024-02-29T00:00:00.000Z" }
  ```

- **Using a library like Lodash's `_.cloneDeep()`:** Lodash provides a robust `cloneDeep()` function that handles complex object structures and data types correctly.

  ```plaintext
  import { cloneDeep } from 'lodash';

  const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 }, d: new Date() };
  const obj2 = cloneDeep(obj1);

  obj1.b.c = 3;
  console.log(obj1); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 3 }, d: 2024-02-29T00:00:00.000Z }
  console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 2 }, d: 2024-02-29T00:00:00.000Z }
  ```

- **Recursive Function:** You can also create your own recursive function to perform a deep copy, but this is more complex.

## Copying Symbol-keyed Properties and Enumerability

`Object.assign()` copies both string-keyed and symbol-keyed properties. It also only copies _enumerable_ properties.

```plaintext
const obj1 = {
  a: 1,
  [Symbol('foo')]: 'bar' // Symbol-keyed property
};

Object.defineProperty(obj1, 'hidden', {
  value: 'secret',
  enumerable: false // Non-enumerable property
});


const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1);

console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, [Symbol(foo)]: 'bar' } (The symbol is copied)
console.log(obj2.hidden); // Output: undefined (Non-enumerable properties are not copied)
```

## Use Cases for `Object.assign()`

- **Merging Configuration Objects:** Combining default settings with user-provided configurations.
- **Creating Copies of Objects:** To avoid mutating the original object, especially in state management (like Redux).
- **Adding Properties to Existing Objects:** Dynamically extending an object with new properties.
- **Updating State in React/Redux:** Commonly used to create new state objects based on previous state.

## Considerations and Best Practices

- **Mutation:** Remember that `Object.assign()` modifies the target object. If you want to avoid mutation, always use an empty object (`{}`) as the target to create a new object.
- **Shallow Copy:** Be aware of the shallow copy behavior, especially when dealing with nested objects or arrays. Use deep copy techniques when necessary.
- **Performance:** For very large objects, deep copying can be performance-intensive. Consider optimizing your code or using libraries specifically designed for performance.
- **Alternatives:** The spread operator (`...`) provides a more concise syntax for creating shallow copies and merging objects, and is often preferred.

  ```plaintext
  const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
  const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };

  const newObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; // Equivalent to Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2)
  console.log(newObject); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
  ```

## Conclusion

`Object.assign()` is a fundamental JavaScript method for object manipulation. By understanding its behavior, particularly its shallow copy nature, you can effectively use it to merge objects, create copies, and update object properties while avoiding unexpected side effects. Remember to consider deep copy alternatives when working with nested objects and arrays to ensure data integrity and prevent unintended mutations. Modern JavaScript often uses the spread operator for similar tasks, so familiarize yourself with both methods.
