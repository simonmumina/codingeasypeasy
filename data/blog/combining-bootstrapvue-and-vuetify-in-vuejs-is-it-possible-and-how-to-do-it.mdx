# Combining BootstrapVue and Vuetify in Vue.js: Is It Possible and How To Do It?

Vue.js developers are often spoiled for choice when it comes to UI component libraries.  Two of the most popular are BootstrapVue and Vuetify. BootstrapVue brings the power of Bootstrap to Vue.js with a focus on accessibility and ease of use. Vuetify, on the other hand, provides a rich set of Material Design components and a comprehensive suite of features.  The question naturally arises: can you use *both* BootstrapVue and Vuetify in the same project?  The short answer is **yes, it's possible, but it comes with complexities and potential pitfalls.** This post will explore the reasons why you might want to, the challenges you'll face, and provide strategies with code examples for achieving a successful integration.

## Why Combine BootstrapVue and Vuetify?

Before diving into the "how," let's consider the "why."  Why would you want to combine these two powerful frameworks?  There are several reasons:

*   **Leveraging Strengths:**  Perhaps you love Vuetify's data tables and advanced form components but prefer BootstrapVue's grid system or specific utility classes.  Combining them allows you to cherry-pick the best features from each.

*   **Migration Strategy:** You might be migrating an existing Bootstrap-based Vue.js application to Vuetify.  Using both frameworks concurrently provides a gradual migration path, minimizing disruption and allowing you to migrate components piece by piece.

*   **Specific Component Needs:**  One framework might offer a component that the other lacks.  For example, BootstrapVue might have a specific datepicker component that perfectly fits your needs, while Vuetify excels in other areas.

*   **Team Preference:**  Different team members might have experience or preference for different frameworks. Combining them allows for a more collaborative approach, especially in large projects.

## The Challenges of Integration

While combining BootstrapVue and Vuetify is technically possible, it's not without its challenges:

*   **CSS Conflicts:** Both BootstrapVue and Vuetify come with their own stylesheets. These stylesheets can contain conflicting CSS rules, leading to unexpected visual inconsistencies and styling issues. This is often the *biggest* hurdle.

*   **JavaScript Conflicts:** Although less common, JavaScript conflicts can also occur, especially if both frameworks rely on similar utilities or libraries.

*   **Increased Bundle Size:**  Importing both frameworks will significantly increase the size of your application bundle, potentially affecting performance and loading times.

*   **Complexity:** Managing two separate UI frameworks adds complexity to your project.  You'll need to be mindful of styling conventions, component interactions, and potential conflicts.

*   **Overriding Styles:**  You'll likely need to write custom CSS to override default styles from both frameworks to achieve a consistent and harmonious look and feel.

## Strategies for Combining BootstrapVue and Vuetify

Here are several strategies you can use to mitigate the challenges and successfully combine BootstrapVue and Vuetify:

### 1.  Selective Imports and Tree Shaking

**Concept:** Avoid importing the entire framework.  Import only the specific components and functionalities you need.  This helps to reduce bundle size and minimize CSS conflicts.  Utilize tree shaking to further eliminate unused code.

**Code Example (Vue CLI project):**

First, install both libraries:

```bash
npm install bootstrap-vue vuetify
# or
yarn add bootstrap-vue vuetify
```

Instead of globally importing everything in `main.js`:

```javascript
// BAD PRACTICE - Imports EVERYTHING
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import BootstrapVue from 'bootstrap-vue'
import Vuetify from 'vuetify'

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
import 'bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css'
import 'vuetify/dist/vuetify.min.css'

Vue.use(BootstrapVue)
Vue.use(Vuetify)


new Vue({
  render: h => h(App),
}).$mount('#app')
```

Import only what you need in your component files:

```vue
// MyComponent.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button variant="primary">BootstrapVue Button</b-button>
    <v-btn color="primary">Vuetify Button</v-btn>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { BButton } from 'bootstrap-vue'
import { VBtn } from 'vuetify/lib' // Import specific components

export default {
  components: {
    BButton,
    VBtn,
  },
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We import `BButton` and `VBtn` *directly* from their respective libraries. This avoids importing entire frameworks.
*   Modern build tools like Webpack and Parcel will perform tree shaking, removing any unused code from the final bundle.

**Important:** Configure tree shaking in your `vue.config.js` (or equivalent) if it's not already enabled by default.

### 2. CSS Scoping and Namespacing

**Concept:** Use CSS scoping techniques to isolate the styles of each framework within their respective components.  This prevents CSS rules from one framework from inadvertently affecting components from the other.  Consider using CSS modules or scoped styles in Vue components.

**Code Example (Scoped Styles):**

```vue
// MyComponent.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button variant="primary">BootstrapVue Button</b-button>
    <v-btn color="primary">Vuetify Button</v-btn>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { BButton } from 'bootstrap-vue'
import { VBtn } from 'vuetify/lib'

export default {
  components: {
    BButton,
    VBtn,
  },
}
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Styles specific to this component */
/* BootstrapVue styles */
.b-button {
  margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Vuetify styles */
.v-btn {
  text-transform: none; /* Example override */
}
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `scoped` attribute in the `<style>` tag ensures that the CSS rules defined within that block apply only to the component itself.  Vue.js automatically adds unique attributes to the HTML elements and CSS selectors to achieve this isolation.

**Code Example (CSS Modules):**

```vue
// MyComponent.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button :class="styles.bootstrapButton" variant="primary">BootstrapVue Button</b-button>
    <v-btn :class="styles.vuetifyButton" color="primary">Vuetify Button</v-btn>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { BButton } from 'bootstrap-vue'
import { VBtn } from 'vuetify/lib'
import styles from './MyComponent.module.css' // Import CSS Modules

export default {
  components: {
    BButton,
    VBtn,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      styles,
    };
  },
}
</script>

<style module lang="css" src="./MyComponent.module.css"></style>
```

```css
/* MyComponent.module.css */
.bootstrapButton {
  margin-right: 10px;
}

.vuetifyButton {
  text-transform: none; /* Example override */
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   CSS Modules transform class names into unique, locally scoped identifiers.  This prevents naming conflicts and ensures that styles apply only to the intended elements.
*   You import the CSS module as a JavaScript object (`styles`) and access the class names as properties of that object.

### 3. CSS Variable Customization

**Concept:**  Both BootstrapVue and Vuetify allow you to customize their styles using CSS variables (also known as custom properties).  Use these variables to create a consistent theme and ensure that components from both frameworks visually integrate well.

**Example (Overriding Primary Color):**

First, set the Vuetify theme:

```javascript
// plugins/vuetify.js (or equivalent)
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuetify from 'vuetify'
import 'vuetify/dist/vuetify.min.css'

Vue.use(Vuetify)

export default new Vuetify({
  theme: {
    themes: {
      light: {
        primary: '#1976D2', // Default Vuetify primary color
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Then, use CSS variables to override BootstrapVue's primary color to match:

```css
/* Global Styles (or component-specific) */
:root {
  --primary: #1976D2; /* Match Vuetify's primary color */
}

.btn-primary {
  background-color: var(--primary);
  border-color: var(--primary);
}

.btn-primary:hover {
  background-color: darken(var(--primary), 10%);
  border-color: darken(var(--primary), 10%);
}

/* BootstrapVue uses .btn-primary class */

/* You may need to use !important to override BootstrapVue's styles if they have higher specificity */
.btn-primary {
   background-color: var(--primary) !important;
   border-color: var(--primary) !important;
}


```

**Explanation:**

*   We define a CSS variable `--primary` and set its value to Vuetify's primary color.
*   We then use this variable in our custom CSS to style BootstrapVue's `.btn-primary` class, ensuring that it uses the same color.

### 4.  Component Wrapping and Abstraction

**Concept:** Create custom wrapper components that encapsulate components from both BootstrapVue and Vuetify.  This provides a consistent API for your application and allows you to abstract away the underlying implementation details.

**Example (Button Wrapper):**

```vue
// MyButton.vue
<template>
  <component :is="buttonType" v-bind="$attrs" v-on="$listeners">
    <slot></slot>
  </component>
</template>

<script>
import { BButton } from 'bootstrap-vue'
import { VBtn } from 'vuetify/lib'

export default {
  props: {
    framework: {
      type: String,
      default: 'bootstrap', // or 'vuetify'
      validator: value => ['bootstrap', 'vuetify'].includes(value),
    },
  },
  computed: {
    buttonType() {
      return this.framework === 'bootstrap' ? BButton : VBtn;
    }
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `MyButton` component takes a `framework` prop that determines which button component (BootstrapVue or Vuetify) to render.
*   `v-bind="$attrs"` passes all attributes to the underlying component.  This makes the wrapper component transparent.
*   `v-on="$listeners"` passes all event listeners to the underlying component.
*   You use this component like this:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <MyButton framework="bootstrap" variant="primary">Bootstrap Button</MyButton>
    <MyButton framework="vuetify" color="primary">Vuetify Button</MyButton>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import MyButton from './MyButton.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    MyButton,
  },
}
</script>
```

This allows you to switch between BootstrapVue and Vuetify buttons simply by changing the `framework` prop. You could enhance this by adding default props for common styling elements, simplifying the usage within your application.

### 5. Consider a Single Framework (If Possible)

While combining the two libraries is technically feasible, carefully consider whether it's truly necessary. Adopting a single framework often leads to a simpler, more maintainable, and performant application. Evaluate your requirements and choose the framework that best suits your overall needs.  If you are starting a new project, it is almost always a better idea to select one framework at the start.

## When To Avoid Mixing

Avoid mixing if:

*   **You are starting a new project.** Select one framework from the beginning.
*   **Your needs are mostly covered by a single framework.** Don't introduce unnecessary complexity.
*   **You are concerned about performance and bundle size.** Combining frameworks significantly increases bundle size.
*   **Your team lacks the expertise to manage the complexities of integration.** The maintenance overhead could be significant.

## Conclusion

Combining BootstrapVue and Vuetify in a Vue.js project is possible, but requires careful planning and execution. By selectively importing components, using CSS scoping and variable customization, and creating wrapper components, you can mitigate the challenges and achieve a successful integration. However, always consider whether a single framework might be a better option for your project.  The best approach is to prioritize simplicity, maintainability, and performance. If a single framework fulfills the majority of your requirements, sticking with it will likely save you time and effort in the long run.
