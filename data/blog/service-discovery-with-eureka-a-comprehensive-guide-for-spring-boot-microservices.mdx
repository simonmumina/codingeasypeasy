# Service Discovery with Eureka: A Comprehensive Guide for Spring Boot Microservices

In the world of microservices, managing and coordinating numerous independent services can be a significant challenge. Service discovery provides a solution by allowing services to dynamically locate and communicate with each other without hardcoded configurations. Netflix Eureka, now a part of the Spring Cloud Netflix project, is a widely used service discovery server for Spring Boot applications. This article will walk you through a comprehensive guide on how to use Eureka for service discovery in your Spring Boot microservices architecture.

## What is Service Discovery?

Service discovery is the process by which services within a microservices architecture automatically locate and register themselves with a registry. This allows other services to discover and communicate with them without needing to know their specific network locations or IP addresses. It simplifies communication, enhances scalability, and improves resilience in a distributed environment.

**Why is Service Discovery Important?**

- **Dynamic Environments:** Microservices often run in dynamic environments where instances can be scaled up or down, and IP addresses can change frequently. Service discovery handles these changes automatically.
- **Loose Coupling:** Services are decoupled from each other, as they don't need to know the specific location of other services. This improves maintainability and flexibility.
- **Scalability:** Service discovery makes it easier to scale services independently, as new instances can register themselves with the registry.
- **Resilience:** If a service instance fails, other services can automatically discover and connect to available instances.

## Netflix Eureka: An Overview

Eureka is a REST-based service discovery server from Netflix. It provides a central registry where microservices can register themselves and discover other services. It is a core component of the Spring Cloud Netflix project, making it easy to integrate into Spring Boot applications.

**Key Features of Eureka:**

- **Service Registry:** Maintains a list of all registered services and their locations.
- **Service Registration:** Allows services to register themselves with the registry.
- **Service Discovery:** Enables services to discover the location of other services.
- **Health Checks:** Provides mechanisms for monitoring the health of registered services.
- **Self-Preservation:** Protects the registry from becoming unavailable during network partitions.

## Setting up Eureka Server

First, we need to set up the Eureka Server. This will act as the central registry for our microservices.

**1. Create a Spring Boot Project for Eureka Server:**

Use Spring Initializr ([https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/)) to create a new Spring Boot project with the following dependencies:

- Spring Web
- Eureka Server

**2. Configure Eureka Server:**

Add the `@EnableEurekaServer` annotation to your main application class:

```plaintext
// EurekaServerApplication.java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

**3. Configure `application.yml`:**

Configure the `application.yml` file to set up the Eureka Server:

```plaintext
# application.yml
server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
  server:
    enable-self-preservation: false # disable self-preservation in development for faster testing
    eviction-interval-timer-in-ms: 5000 # Speed up instance eviction for testing

spring:
  application:
    name: eureka-server
```

**Explanation:**

- `server.port`: Sets the port on which the Eureka Server will run (typically 8761).
- `eureka.client.register-with-eureka`: Prevents the Eureka Server from registering itself as a client. This is crucial because it _is_ the registry.
- `eureka.client.fetch-registry`: Prevents the Eureka Server from trying to fetch its own registry from another Eureka server (since it's the only one).
- `eureka.server.enable-self-preservation`: Disables self-preservation in development environments. In production, self-preservation mode helps Eureka to maintain the service registry during network partitions. Disable for quicker testing as you're likely developing locally.
- `eureka.server.eviction-interval-timer-in-ms`: Sets the interval (in milliseconds) at which the Eureka Server evicts stale instances. Shorter intervals speed up testing, but should be longer in production.
- `spring.application.name`: Sets the application name, which is useful for logging and management.

**4. Run the Eureka Server:**

Run the `EurekaServerApplication`. You can access the Eureka Server dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:8761` in your browser. You should see the Eureka dashboard which will initially show no registered applications.

## Registering Microservices with Eureka

Now that we have the Eureka Server running, let's register a couple of microservices with it.

**1. Create a Spring Boot Project for Microservice 1:**

Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project with the following dependencies:

- Spring Web
- Eureka Discovery Client

**2. Configure Microservice 1:**

Add the `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation to your main application class:

```plaintext
// Microservice1Application.java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@RestController
public class Microservice1Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Microservice1Application.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Microservice 1!";
    }
}
```

**3. Configure `application.yml` for Microservice 1:**

Configure the `application.yml` file to register the microservice with Eureka:

```plaintext
# application.yml
server:
  port: 8081

spring:
  application:
    name: microservice1

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

**Explanation:**

- `server.port`: Sets the port on which Microservice 1 will run (e.g., 8081).
- `spring.application.name`: Sets the application name, which will be used for service discovery (e.g., "microservice1"). This is the key used to discover this service.
- `eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone`: Specifies the URL of the Eureka Server.

**4. Create a Spring Boot Project for Microservice 2:**

Repeat steps 1-3 to create another microservice (Microservice 2) on a different port (e.g., 8082) with a different application name (e.g., "microservice2"). You will need to create the `Microservice2Application.java` similar to the previous example, and adjust the `application.yml`.

**Microservice2Application.java:**

```plaintext
// Microservice2Application.java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@RestController
public class Microservice2Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Microservice2Application.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting() {
        return "Greetings from Microservice 2!";
    }
}
```

**application.yml for Microservice 2:**

```plaintext
# application.yml
server:
  port: 8082

spring:
  application:
    name: microservice2

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

**5. Run the Microservices:**

Run `Microservice1Application` and `Microservice2Application`. After a few seconds, you should see both services registered in the Eureka Server dashboard at `http://localhost:8761`. You will see them listed under the "Instances currently registered with Eureka" section.

## Consuming Services Through Eureka

Now that the services are registered, let's see how one microservice can consume the other through Eureka. We'll modify `Microservice1` to call `Microservice2`.

**1. Add `RestTemplate` Configuration to Microservice 1:**

Create a configuration class to expose a `RestTemplate` bean. `RestTemplate` is a Spring class used for making HTTP requests.

```plaintext
// RestTemplateConfig.java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@Configuration
public class RestTemplateConfig {

    @Bean
    public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}
```

**2. Modify `Microservice1Application` to Call Microservice 2:**

Inject the `RestTemplate` and use the `DiscoveryClient` to find the URL of `Microservice2`.

```plaintext
// Microservice1Application.java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

import java.util.List;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@RestController
public class Microservice1Application {

    @Autowired
    private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Microservice1Application.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Microservice 1!";
    }

    @GetMapping("/call-microservice2")
    public String callMicroservice2() {
        List<String> services = discoveryClient.getServices();
        System.out.println("Available services: " + services);

        List<org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance> instances = discoveryClient.getInstances("microservice2");
        if (instances != null && !instances.isEmpty()) {
            org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance serviceInstance = instances.get(0);
            String url = serviceInstance.getUri().toString() + "/greeting";  // Adjust the endpoint to match Microservice 2
            System.out.println("Calling Microservice 2 at URL: " + url);
            return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
        } else {
            return "Microservice 2 not found!";
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `@Autowired private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;`: Injects the `DiscoveryClient` to retrieve service information.
- `@Autowired private RestTemplate restTemplate;`: Injects the `RestTemplate` to make HTTP requests.
- `discoveryClient.getInstances("microservice2")`: Retrieves a list of `ServiceInstance` objects for the service named "microservice2". This is the key you configured in the `application.yml` of `microservice2`.
- `serviceInstance.getUri().toString()`: Gets the base URL of the service instance.
- `restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class)`: Makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and returns the response as a String.

**3. Test the Consumption:**

Restart `Microservice1Application`. Now, navigate to `http://localhost:8081/call-microservice2` in your browser. You should see the response "Greetings from Microservice 2!". Check the console output of `Microservice1` to verify the service discovery process and the URL being called.

## Using `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate` with Ribbon

A more convenient way to consume services is to use a `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate` in conjunction with Ribbon (a client-side load balancer). This removes the need to manually retrieve service instances and construct URLs.

**1. Add Ribbon Dependency:**

Ensure that you have the `spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` dependency in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` for both microservices. Since `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` previously bundled ribbon by default, it needs to be explicitly added from the Spring Cloud Loadbalancer.

```plaintext
<!-- pom.xml -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**2. Configure `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate`:**

Modify the `RestTemplateConfig.java` in Microservice 1 to use `@LoadBalanced`:

```plaintext
// RestTemplateConfig.java
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalanced;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@Configuration
public class RestTemplateConfig {

    @LoadBalanced
    @Bean
    public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}
```

**3. Update `Microservice1Application` to Use `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate`:**

Modify `Microservice1Application.java` to use the `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate`. You can now directly call the service by its application name.

```plaintext
// Microservice1Application.java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@RestController
public class Microservice1Application {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Microservice1Application.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Microservice 1!";
    }

    @GetMapping("/call-microservice2")
    public String callMicroservice2() {
        String url = "http://microservice2/greeting"; // Use the application name
        System.out.println("Calling Microservice 2 at URL: " + url);
        return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `String url = "http://microservice2/greeting";`: Now, you can directly use the application name (`microservice2`) as the hostname in the URL. Ribbon will resolve the URL to an available instance of `Microservice2`.

**4. Test the Consumption:**

Restart `Microservice1Application`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/call-microservice2`. You should again see "Greetings from Microservice 2!".

## Health Checks

Eureka supports health checks to ensure that only healthy instances are registered. By default, Eureka uses a heartbeat mechanism to determine the health of a service. However, you can customize the health check process. Spring Boot Actuator can be used to provide health information to Eureka.

**1. Add Spring Boot Actuator Dependency:**

Add the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency to both Microservice 1 and Microservice 2.

```plaintext
<!-- pom.xml -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**2. Configure Health Endpoint:**

Configure the management endpoints in your `application.yml` to expose the health endpoint.

```plaintext
# application.yml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health
```

**3. Enable Health Check Registration:**

Add the following configuration to the `application.yml` file of the microservices to enable the Eureka health check based on the Spring Boot Actuator health endpoint:

```plaintext
# application.yml
eureka:
  instance:
    health-check-interval-in-seconds: 10
    status-page-url-path: /actuator/info
    health-check-url-path: /actuator/health
```

**Explanation:**

- `health-check-interval-in-seconds`: The interval, in seconds, at which Eureka will check the health of the instance.
- `status-page-url-path`: The path to the status page, which can be any endpoint exposing application status information. `/actuator/info` is provided by spring boot actuator.
- `health-check-url-path`: The path to the health check endpoint. `/actuator/health` is provided by spring boot actuator.

Now Eureka will use the Spring Boot Actuator health endpoint to determine the health of the microservices.

## Conclusion

This guide provided a comprehensive overview of using Eureka for service discovery in Spring Boot microservices architectures. By implementing Eureka, you can build resilient, scalable, and loosely coupled microservices applications. Remember to configure your Eureka Server, register your microservices, and use a `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate` for seamless service consumption. Implementing health checks provides an extra layer of resilience, ensuring that only healthy instances are available for service discovery. This enables your microservices to dynamically find and communicate with each other, making your system more robust and manageable.
