# Mastering Custom Decorators in NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, leverages TypeScript and embraces design patterns like Dependency Injection (DI) to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications. A key feature that contributes to NestJS's elegance and power is the concept of **decorators**. While NestJS provides built-in decorators like `@Controller`, `@Get`, and `@Injectable`, the true power lies in the ability to create **custom decorators** tailored to your specific application needs.

This blog post will guide you through the process of creating and using custom decorators in NestJS, explaining the underlying concepts and providing practical code examples to illustrate their usage.

## What are Decorators?

In essence, decorators are a TypeScript feature that allows you to add metadata and modify the behavior of classes, methods, properties, and parameters.  They use a special syntax (`@expression`) and are essentially syntactic sugar for functions that can be applied to various parts of your code.

Think of them as annotations that can modify or augment the class or method they're attached to.  They provide a clean and concise way to inject logic, perform validations, and manage metadata without cluttering your core business logic.

## Why Use Custom Decorators in NestJS?

Custom decorators offer several advantages in NestJS development:

*   **Code Reusability:**  Encapsulate common logic into a decorator and reuse it across multiple controllers, services, or components, reducing code duplication.
*   **Improved Readability:**  Cleanly separate cross-cutting concerns from your core business logic, making your code easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Enhanced Maintainability:**  Changes to common logic need only be made in the decorator definition, automatically updating all instances where it's used.
*   **Simplified Dependency Injection:** Inject dependencies directly within methods or properties using custom decorators.
*   **Increased Testability:**  Isolate specific behaviors within decorators, making it easier to unit test individual components.

## Creating Your First Custom Decorator

Let's start with a simple example.  Suppose you want to create a decorator that logs the current user's ID whenever a specific method is called in a controller.

**1. Create a new file (e.g., `user.decorator.ts`):**

```typescript
import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator(
  (data: string | undefined, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
    const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user; // Assuming your authentication middleware populates `request.user`

    return data ? user?.[data] : user; // Return specific user property or the entire user object
  },
);
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`createParamDecorator`:** This function from `@nestjs/common` is essential.  It creates a parameter decorator that extracts data from the request.
*   **`(data: string | undefined, ctx: ExecutionContext)`:** This is the callback function executed when the decorator is used.
    *   `data`:  Optional data passed to the decorator when it's used (e.g., `@User('id')`).
    *   `ctx: ExecutionContext`: Provides access to the execution context of the route handler, including the request, response, and arguments.
*   **`ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest()`:**  Retrieves the Express or Fastify request object.
*   **`request.user`:** This assumes that your authentication middleware (e.g., Passport.js) has already populated the `request.user` object with user information.  The exact structure of this object will depend on your authentication setup.
*   **`data ? user?.[data] : user`:**  This is a conditional return.
    *   If `data` is provided (e.g., `@User('id')`), it attempts to return the value of the property specified by `data` from the `user` object (using optional chaining `?.` to handle cases where `user` might be null).
    *   If `data` is *not* provided (e.g., `@User()`), it returns the entire `user` object.

**2. Use the Decorator in a Controller:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { User } from './user.decorator';

@Controller('profile')
@UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt')) // Assuming JWT authentication
export class ProfileController {

  @Get()
  getProfile(@User() user: any) { // Use the custom decorator
    console.log('User Profile requested by user:', user);
    return { message: 'Profile data', user };
  }

  @Get('id')
  getUserId(@User('id') userId: string) { // Get a specific property (user ID)
    console.log('User ID requested:', userId);
    return { userId };
  }

  @Get('email')
  getUserEmail(@User('email') userEmail: string) {
    console.log("User Email requested: ", userEmail);
    return {userEmail}
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`import { User } from './user.decorator';`:** Imports the custom decorator we created.
*   **`@UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt'))`:**  This ensures that only authenticated users can access the profile endpoint. The `AuthGuard('jwt')` assumes you've configured JWT authentication with Passport.js or a similar mechanism.
*   **`@User() user: any`:**  This is where the magic happens. The `@User()` decorator is applied to the `user` parameter. When the `getProfile` method is called, NestJS will use the `createParamDecorator` function we defined earlier to extract the user object from the request and inject it into the `user` parameter.  We declare the type as `any` for simplicity, but you should ideally define a proper TypeScript interface or type for your user object.
*   **`@User('id') userId: string`:**  This demonstrates how to pass data to the decorator. The string 'id' is passed as the `data` argument to the decorator's callback function.  The decorator extracts the `id` property from the `user` object and injects it into the `userId` parameter.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Authentication Middleware:**  The `@User` decorator relies on your authentication middleware populating the `request.user` object.  Make sure your middleware is configured correctly. This is a *critical security* consideration. If `request.user` is not properly populated, the decorator could expose sensitive data or lead to unauthorized access.
*   **User Object Structure:** The structure of the `request.user` object is specific to your authentication system. Adapt the decorator's logic to correctly extract the desired information based on how your authentication middleware stores user data.
*   **Type Safety:**  Define TypeScript interfaces or types for your user object to improve type safety and code clarity.

## Creating a Method Decorator

Now, let's create a more complex example: a method decorator that logs the execution time of a method.

**1. Create a new file (e.g., `log-execution-time.decorator.ts`):**

```typescript
import { Logger, SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const LogExecutionTime = (options?: { logResult?: boolean }) => {
  const logger = new Logger('ExecutionTime');
  return (
    target: any,
    propertyKey: string,
    descriptor: PropertyDescriptor,
  ) => {
    const originalMethod = descriptor.value;

    descriptor.value = async function (...args: any[]) {
      const startTime = Date.now();
      const result = await originalMethod.apply(this, args);
      const endTime = Date.now();
      const executionTime = endTime - startTime;

      logger.log(
        `${target.constructor.name}.${propertyKey} executed in ${executionTime}ms`,
      );

      if (options?.logResult) {
          logger.debug(`Result of ${target.constructor.name}.${propertyKey}:`, result)
      }

      return result;
    };

    return descriptor;
  };
};
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`LogExecutionTime`:** This is a factory function.  It returns the actual decorator function.  This allows you to pass configuration options to the decorator (e.g., whether to log the result of the function).
*   **`(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor)`:** This is the decorator function itself.
    *   `target`: The class on which the method is defined.
    *   `propertyKey`: The name of the method being decorated.
    *   `descriptor`: The property descriptor of the method. This allows you to access and modify the method's behavior.
*   **`originalMethod = descriptor.value`:** Stores a reference to the original method.
*   **`descriptor.value = async function (...args: any[]) { ... }`:**  This is where the magic happens. We *override* the original method with a new function that:
    *   Records the start time.
    *   Calls the original method using `originalMethod.apply(this, args)`.  `apply` ensures that the method is called with the correct `this` context and arguments. We use `await` to ensure the promise resolves.
    *   Records the end time.
    *   Calculates the execution time.
    *   Logs the execution time using the NestJS `Logger`.
    *   Returns the result of the original method.
*   **`return descriptor`:**  Returns the modified descriptor.

**2. Use the Decorator in a Service or Controller:**

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LogExecutionTime } from './log-execution-time.decorator';

@Injectable()
export class MyService {

  @LogExecutionTime({logResult: true}) // Apply the decorator
  async performLongRunningTask(input: number): Promise<number> {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, input)); // Simulate a long-running task
    return input * 2;
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`@LogExecutionTime()`:**  Applies the decorator to the `performLongRunningTask` method.  When this method is called, the decorator will log its execution time.
*   **`{logResult: true}`:**  Configures the decorator to log the result of the function as well.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Asynchronous Methods:** Note the use of `async` and `await` in the decorator and the service method. This is crucial for handling asynchronous operations correctly.
*   **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling within the decorator to catch any exceptions thrown by the original method and log them appropriately.
*   **Logger Context:**  Use the `Logger` class with a specific context (e.g., `'ExecutionTime'`) to easily filter and identify log messages related to execution time measurements.

## Using `SetMetadata` with Custom Decorators

NestJS provides the `SetMetadata` decorator, which allows you to attach metadata to classes, methods, or properties. This metadata can then be accessed and used by other decorators, interceptors, or guards.

**Example: Role-Based Access Control**

Let's create a custom decorator that sets metadata indicating the required role for accessing a route.

**1. Create a `roles.decorator.ts` file:**

```typescript
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`Roles(...roles: string[])`:**  This is a factory function that accepts an array of roles as arguments.
*   **`SetMetadata('roles', roles)`:**  This sets the metadata with the key `'roles'` and the value being the array of roles passed to the function.

**2. Use the Decorator in a Controller:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Roles } from './roles.decorator';
import { RolesGuard } from './roles.guard';

@Controller('admin')
@UseGuards(RolesGuard) // Apply the RolesGuard
export class AdminController {

  @Get('users')
  @Roles('admin') // Require 'admin' role
  getUsers() {
    return { message: 'Admin users data' };
  }

  @Get('settings')
  @Roles('superadmin') // Require 'superadmin' role
  getSettings() {
    return { message: 'Admin settings data' };
  }
}
```

**3. Create a `roles.guard.ts` file:**

```typescript
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Reflector } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private reflector: Reflector) {}

  canActivate(
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    const requiredRoles = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride<string[]>('roles', [
      context.getHandler(),
      context.getClass(),
    ]);
    if (!requiredRoles) {
      return true; // No roles required, allow access
    }
    const { user } = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return requiredRoles.some((role) => user.roles?.includes(role)); // Check if user has required roles
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`Reflector`:** The `Reflector` class from `@nestjs/core` allows you to access metadata attached to route handlers and controllers.
*   **`this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getHandler())`:**  Retrieves the `roles` metadata from the route handler (method) using the `Reflector`.
*   **`this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getClass())`:** Retrieves `roles` from the class (controller).
*   **`requiredRoles.some((role) => user.roles.includes(role))`:** Checks if the user's roles include any of the required roles. It assumes that the `user` object has a `roles` property, which is an array of role strings.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Authentication Middleware:** As before, ensure your authentication middleware populates the `request.user` object with the user's roles.
*   **Roles Array:** The `user.roles` property should be an array of role strings for this example to work correctly.
*   **Guard Application:**  The `RolesGuard` is applied at the controller level using `@UseGuards(RolesGuard)`, meaning it will apply to all routes within that controller. You can also apply it at the route level to restrict access to specific routes.

## Best Practices for Creating Custom Decorators

*   **Keep Decorators Simple:**  Decorators should primarily handle cross-cutting concerns and avoid complex business logic.
*   **Use Descriptive Names:**  Choose names that clearly indicate the purpose of the decorator.
*   **Provide Configuration Options:**  Use factory functions to allow developers to configure decorators with options.
*   **Document Your Decorators:**  Clearly document the purpose, usage, and any dependencies of your custom decorators.
*   **Consider Performance:**  Be mindful of the performance impact of your decorators, especially if they perform complex operations.
