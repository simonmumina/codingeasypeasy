# Build a Video Call App with Node.js: A Step-by-Step Guide

In today's connected world, video conferencing has become an essential tool for communication, collaboration, and remote work. Building your own video call application can seem daunting, but with Node.js, WebRTC, and Socket.IO, it's more accessible than you might think. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a basic, yet functional, video call application.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** You'll need Node.js installed to run the server-side logic. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm comes bundled with Node.js.
- **A Code Editor:** VS Code, Sublime Text, or any editor you prefer.
- **Basic JavaScript Knowledge:** Familiarity with JavaScript syntax and concepts.
- **Basic HTML and CSS Knowledge:** Understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling.

## Technology Stack

We will be using the following technologies:

- **Node.js:** The runtime environment for our server-side code.
- **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Socket.IO:** A library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers. Essential for signaling between peers.
- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):** A technology that enables real-time audio and video communication directly between browsers (peer-to-peer). We won't be implementing WebRTC directly, Socket.IO will handle much of the complexities.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** For the client-side application.

## Project Setup

1.  **Create a Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    mkdir node-video-call
    cd node-video-call
    ```

2.  **Initialize a Node.js Project:**

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

    This command creates a `package.json` file, which will store your project's dependencies and metadata.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install express socket.io
    ```

    This installs the Express.js and Socket.IO libraries.

## Server-Side Implementation (Node.js with Express.js and Socket.IO)

1.  **Create `server.js`:** Create a file named `server.js` in your project directory. This file will contain the server-side code.

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express')
    const http = require('http')
    const socketIO = require('socket.io')

    const app = express()
    const server = http.createServer(app)
    const io = socketIO(server, {
      cors: {
        origin: '*', // Adjust this for production!
        methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
      },
    })

    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

    app.use(express.static('public')) // Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS)

    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      console.log('A user connected:', socket.id)

      socket.on('join-room', (roomId, userId) => {
        socket.join(roomId)
        socket.to(roomId).emit('user-connected', userId)

        socket.on('disconnect', () => {
          console.log('User disconnected:', userId)
          socket.to(roomId).emit('user-disconnected', userId)
        })
      })

      socket.on('offer', (roomId, description) => {
        socket.to(roomId).emit('offer', description)
      })

      socket.on('answer', (roomId, description) => {
        socket.to(roomId).emit('answer', description)
      })

      socket.on('ice-candidate', (roomId, candidate) => {
        socket.to(roomId).emit('ice-candidate', candidate)
      })
    })

    server.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`)
    })
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - **Import necessary modules:** We import `express`, `http`, and `socket.io`.
    - **Create an Express app:** We create an instance of the Express application.
    - **Create an HTTP server:** We wrap the Express app with an HTTP server. This is required for Socket.IO.
    - **Initialize Socket.IO:** We initialize Socket.IO, passing the HTTP server as an argument. The `cors` option is important to allow cross origin requests. **Important: In a production environment, replace "\*" with the actual origin of your client application.**
    - **Define the port:** We define the port the server will listen on (defaulting to 3000).
    - **Serve static files:** `app.use(express.static('public'));` tells Express to serve files from the `public` directory. We'll put our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in this directory.
    - **Socket.IO connection handling:** The `io.on('connection', ...)` block handles new Socket.IO connections.
      - `socket.on('join-room', ...)`: Handles when a user joins a room. It emits a `user-connected` event to all other users in the room, notifying them of the new participant. It also sets up a `disconnect` handler.
      - `socket.on('disconnect', ...)`: Handles when a user disconnects. It emits a `user-disconnected` event to all other users in the room.
      - `socket.on('offer', ...)`: Forwards the WebRTC offer to the other peer in the room.
      - `socket.on('answer', ...)`: Forwards the WebRTC answer to the peer that sent the offer.
      - `socket.on('ice-candidate', ...)`: Forwards ICE candidates to help establish a direct connection.
    - **Start the server:** We start the server and listen for incoming connections.

2.  **Create the `public` Directory:**

    Create a directory named `public` in your project directory. This directory will contain the client-side files.

    ```bash
    mkdir public
    ```

## Client-Side Implementation (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

1.  **Create `index.html` in the `public` directory:**

    ```plaintext
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Video Call App</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Video Call App</h1>

        <div id="video-grid">
          <video id="localVideo" autoplay muted playsinline></video>
          <video id="remoteVideo" autoplay playsinline></video>
        </div>

        <input type="text" id="room-id" placeholder="Enter Room ID" />
        <button id="join-room-btn">Join Room</button>

        <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - Basic HTML structure with a title and a link to the CSS file.
    - `video-grid` div to hold the local and remote video elements.
    - `localVideo` and `remoteVideo` elements to display the video streams. The `autoplay`, `muted`, and `playsinline` attributes are important for the video to work correctly in most browsers.
    - An input field for the room ID and a button to join the room.
    - Includes `socket.io.js` and `script.js` for client-side logic.

2.  **Create `style.css` in the `public` directory:**

    ```plaintext
    body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
        text-align: center;
    }

    #video-grid {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
    }

    video {
        width: 300px;
        margin: 10px;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - Basic CSS styling for the page. Adjust as desired.

3.  **Create `script.js` in the `public` directory:**

    ```javascript
    const socket = io() // Connect to the Socket.IO server
    const localVideo = document.getElementById('localVideo')
    const remoteVideo = document.getElementById('remoteVideo')
    const roomIdInput = document.getElementById('room-id')
    const joinRoomButton = document.getElementById('join-room-btn')

    let localStream
    let remoteStream
    let peerConnection

    const configuration = {
      iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }],
    }

    // Get user media (camera and audio)
    async function startVideo() {
      try {
        localStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
        localVideo.srcObject = localStream
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error accessing media devices:', error)
      }
    }

    startVideo() // Start the video stream on page load.

    joinRoomButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
      const roomId = roomIdInput.value
      if (roomId) {
        // Join the room on the server.
        socket.emit('join-room', roomId, socket.id) // Sending socket.id as userId
        console.log(`Joining room: ${roomId}`)
      }
    })

    socket.on('user-connected', async (userId) => {
      console.log('User connected:', userId)
      await createOffer(userId)
    })

    async function createOffer(remoteUserId) {
      peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration)

      localStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => {
        peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream)
      })

      peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
        if (event.candidate) {
          socket.emit('ice-candidate', roomIdInput.value, event.candidate)
        }
      }

      peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
        remoteVideo.srcObject = event.streams[0]
      }

      const offer = await peerConnection.createOffer()
      await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer)
      socket.emit('offer', roomIdInput.value, offer)
    }

    socket.on('offer', async (description) => {
      peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration)

      localStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => {
        peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream)
      })

      peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
        if (event.candidate) {
          socket.emit('ice-candidate', roomIdInput.value, event.candidate)
        }
      }

      peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
        remoteVideo.srcObject = event.streams[0]
      }

      try {
        await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(description)
        const answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer()
        await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer)
        socket.emit('answer', roomIdInput.value, answer)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error handling offer:', error)
      }
    })

    socket.on('answer', async (description) => {
      try {
        await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(description)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error handling answer:', error)
      }
    })

    socket.on('ice-candidate', async (candidate) => {
      try {
        await peerConnection.addIceCandidate(candidate)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error adding ice candidate:', error)
      }
    })

    socket.on('user-disconnected', (userId) => {
      console.log('User disconnected:', userId)
      // Optionally, handle the user disconnection (e.g., remove their video element)
      // You'll need a way to track which video element belongs to which user ID.
    })
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - **Connect to Socket.IO:** `const socket = io();` establishes a connection to the Socket.IO server.
    - **Get DOM elements:** We get references to the video elements, the room ID input, and the join button.
    - **`startVideo()` function:** This function uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` to access the user's camera and microphone. The video stream is then displayed in the `localVideo` element.
    - **Event listener for the join button:** When the user clicks the "Join Room" button, the `joinRoomButton.addEventListener` block executes. It gets the room ID from the input field and emits a `join-room` event to the server, including the room ID and the socket's ID (which we'll use as the user ID).
    - **`socket.on('user-connected', ...)`:** When the server emits a `user-connected` event, this block executes. It calls the `createOffer` function to initiate the WebRTC connection.
    - **`createOffer(remoteUserId)` function:**
      - Creates an `RTCPeerConnection`. `RTCPeerConnection` is the core WebRTC API for establishing peer-to-peer connections.
      - Adds the local video and audio tracks to the `peerConnection`.
      - Sets up an `onicecandidate` event handler. ICE candidates are used to find the best way to connect the peers. When an ICE candidate is generated, it's sent to the other peer via the `ice-candidate` event.
      - Sets up an `ontrack` event handler. When the remote video track is received, it's displayed in the `remoteVideo` element.
      - Creates a WebRTC offer using `peerConnection.createOffer()`. An offer describes the local peer's media capabilities.
      - Sets the local description of the `peerConnection` to the offer.
      - Emits the offer to the other peer via the `offer` event.
    - **`socket.on('offer', ...)`:** Handles the reception of a WebRTC offer.
      - Creates a new `RTCPeerConnection`.
      - Sets up `onicecandidate` and `ontrack` handlers.
      - Sets the received offer as the remote description.
      - Creates a WebRTC answer using `peerConnection.createAnswer()`. An answer describes the remote peer's accepted media capabilities.
      - Sets the local description to the answer.
      - Emits the answer to the offering peer.
    - **`socket.on('answer', ...)`:** Handles the reception of a WebRTC answer. It sets the answer as the remote description.
    - **`socket.on('ice-candidate', ...)`:** Handles the reception of ICE candidates. It adds the candidate to the `peerConnection`.
    - **`socket.on('user-disconnected', ...)`:** Handles when a user disconnects from the room. In this basic example, it just logs the event. In a more complex application, you would want to remove the video element associated with the disconnected user.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Server:**

    Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    This will start the Node.js server.

2.  **Open the Application in Multiple Browsers:**

    Open `index.html` in two or more browser windows (or on different devices).

3.  **Enter the Same Room ID:**

    In each browser window, enter the same room ID in the input field and click the "Join Room" button.

You should now see the video streams from the connected users in each browser window. If the video streams don't automatically start, make sure your browser is allowing access to your camera and microphone.

## Enhancements and Further Development

This is a basic implementation of a video call application. Here are some ideas for enhancements and further development:

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to handle potential issues such as network connectivity problems or media access failures.
- **User Interface:** Improve the user interface with better styling, controls for muting audio and disabling video, and a list of participants in the room.
- **Scalability:** For larger-scale applications, consider using a more robust signaling server like Janus or Jitsi Meet, or using a cloud-based WebRTC platform like Twilio or Agora.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Add user authentication and authorization to control access to the video call application.
- **Screen Sharing:** Implement screen sharing functionality to allow users to share their screens during the video call.
- **Chat:** Add a chat feature to allow users to communicate via text during the video call.
- **Mobile Support:** Optimize the application for mobile devices.

## Conclusion

Building a video call application with Node.js, WebRTC, and Socket.IO is a rewarding project that allows you to understand the fundamentals of real-time communication. While this guide provides a basic implementation, it serves as a foundation for creating more advanced and feature-rich video conferencing solutions. By leveraging the power of these technologies, you can build a custom video communication platform tailored to your specific needs. Remember to handle CORS issues properly in a production environment and use secure protocols for data transmission. Good luck!
