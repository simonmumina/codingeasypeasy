# Request-Scoped Providers in NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide

NestJS is a powerful framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications using TypeScript. One of its key features is its robust dependency injection (DI) system.  While NestJS primarily uses singleton-scoped providers (created once for the application lifecycle), there are scenarios where you need providers to be created and managed per HTTP request. This is where request-scoped providers come in. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of request-scoped providers in NestJS, covering their use cases, implementation details, and best practices.

## What are Request-Scoped Providers?

A request-scoped provider in NestJS is a dependency that is created and disposed of with each incoming HTTP request. This means that a new instance of the provider is created at the beginning of the request lifecycle and destroyed when the request is completed. This is particularly useful for storing and managing data that is specific to a single request, such as user information, request IDs, or database connections (although generally database connections are managed through connection pooling for efficiency).

## Why Use Request-Scoped Providers?

Here are some common use cases for request-scoped providers:

*   **User Context:** Storing the current user's information (e.g., ID, roles, permissions) for the duration of the request. This allows you to easily access the user's context from any part of your application without repeatedly querying the database.

*   **Request ID/Correlation ID:** Generating and storing a unique identifier for each request. This ID can be used for logging, tracing, and debugging purposes, making it easier to track requests across different services.

*   **Multi-tenancy:** Managing different tenants within a single application instance. Request-scoped providers can store tenant-specific information, allowing you to customize the application's behavior based on the tenant making the request.

*   **Transactional Data:** In some cases, you might want to manage a transaction context that is scoped to a single request.  This is often handled by services, but a request-scoped provider can help manage the transaction lifecycle. (Consider carefully if this is the best approach as database connection pooling is often preferred).

*   **Avoiding Shared State:** When you need to ensure that a provider's state is not shared between different requests. This prevents potential concurrency issues and ensures data isolation.

## Implementing Request-Scoped Providers in NestJS

NestJS provides a built-in mechanism for creating request-scoped providers using the `REQUEST` injection token and the `@Inject` decorator. Here's how you can implement it:

### 1. Import Necessary Modules

First, import the required modules from `@nestjs/core` and `@nestjs/common`:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { REQUEST } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Request } from 'express'; // Import the express Request type
```

### 2. Create a Request-Scoped Provider

Define your provider class and set its scope to `Scope.REQUEST`. Inject the `REQUEST` token to access the `Request` object from the Express framework (or Fastify if you're using that adapter).

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { REQUEST } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Request } from 'express';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class RequestContext {
  private readonly userId: string | null;

  constructor(@Inject(REQUEST) private readonly request: Request) {
    // Assuming your user ID is in the request headers, query parameters, or body.
    // Adapt this logic based on your authentication mechanism.
    this.userId = this.request.headers['user-id'] as string || this.request.query.userId as string || (this.request.body?.userId as string) || null;
  }

  getUserId(): string | null {
    return this.userId;
  }

  // Add other request-specific data accessors here
  getRequestId(): string | undefined {
      return this.request.headers['x-request-id'] as string;
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })`: This decorator marks the class as a provider and sets its scope to `REQUEST`, ensuring a new instance is created for each incoming request.
*   `@Inject(REQUEST) private readonly request: Request`: This injects the Express `Request` object into the provider's constructor.  Note the `Request` type is imported from `express`.
*   The constructor retrieves the user ID from the request headers, query parameters, or body (adapt this logic to your specific authentication mechanism).
*   `getUserId()`: This method provides a simple way to access the user ID from other parts of your application.  The `getRequestId()` function shows how to access another header.

### 3. Register the Provider in a Module

Register the request-scoped provider in your module's `providers` array:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { RequestContext } from './request-context.service';
import { ExampleController } from './example.controller';
import { ExampleService } from './example.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [ExampleController],
  providers: [RequestContext, ExampleService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 4. Inject the Provider in Your Controllers or Services

Now you can inject the `RequestContext` provider into your controllers or services and access the request-specific data:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { RequestContext } from './request-context.service';
import { ExampleService } from './example.service';

@Controller('example')
export class ExampleController {
  constructor(
    private readonly exampleService: ExampleService,
    private readonly requestContext: RequestContext
  ) {}

  @Get()
  getExample(): string {
    const userId = this.requestContext.getUserId();
    const requestId = this.requestContext.getRequestId();
    return this.exampleService.doSomething(userId, requestId);
  }
}

// Example Service
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class ExampleService {
  doSomething(userId: string | null, requestId: string | undefined): string {
    if (userId) {
      return `Hello user ${userId}, your request id is ${requestId}`;
    } else {
      return `Hello anonymous user, your request id is ${requestId}`;
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `RequestContext` provider is injected into the `ExampleController` using constructor injection.
*   The `getExample()` method retrieves the user ID from the `RequestContext` and uses it to personalize the response.
*   The `ExampleService` then uses the provided `userId` and `requestId` to do it's work.

### 5. Handle Dependencies of Request-Scoped Providers

If your request-scoped provider depends on other providers, make sure those dependencies are also available within the request scope.  This might mean making *them* request-scoped as well.  If a singleton provider depends on a request-scoped provider, NestJS will throw an error because a singleton cannot depend on a scope that is shorter than itself.

### Example: A Request-Scoped Logger

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope, Inject, Logger } from '@nestjs/common';
import { REQUEST } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Request } from 'express';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class RequestLogger extends Logger {
  private readonly requestId: string;

  constructor(@Inject(REQUEST) private readonly request: Request) {
    super('RequestLogger'); // Logger context (optional)
    this.requestId = (request.headers['x-request-id'] as string) || 'N/A';
  }

  log(message: any, context?: string) {
    super.log(`[Request ID: ${this.requestId}] ${message}`, context);
  }

  error(message: any, trace?: string, context?: string) {
    super.error(`[Request ID: ${this.requestId}] ${message}`, trace, context);
  }

  warn(message: any, context?: string) {
    super.warn(`[Request ID: ${this.requestId}] ${message}`, context);
  }

  debug(message: any, context?: string) {
    super.debug(`[Request ID: ${this.requestId}] ${message}`, context);
  }

  verbose(message: any, context?: string) {
    super.verbose(`[Request ID: ${this.requestId}] ${message}`, context);
  }
}
```

Then, inject `RequestLogger` instead of `Logger` to include the request ID in your logs.  You can also inject the plain `Logger` and use the context option to indicate the request.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Request-Scoped Providers Sparingly:** Request-scoped providers have a performance overhead compared to singleton providers. Use them only when you truly need request-specific data or state isolation.
*   **Keep Request-Scoped Providers Lightweight:** Avoid storing large or complex data structures in request-scoped providers, as this can impact performance.
*   **Consider Alternatives:** Before using request-scoped providers, consider whether there are alternative solutions that might be more efficient. For example, you could use middleware to attach request-specific data to the `Request` object directly.
*   **Handle Asynchronous Operations Carefully:** If you perform asynchronous operations within a request-scoped provider, ensure that the provider is properly disposed of after the operation is complete to prevent memory leaks.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within your request-scoped providers to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.  Make sure errors are properly logged with the `requestId` if you're using it.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure that your request-scoped providers are working correctly and that they are properly disposed of after each request.

## Alternatives to Request-Scoped Providers

While request-scoped providers are a valuable tool, it's important to consider alternative approaches that might be more suitable in certain scenarios:

*   **Middleware:** Middleware can be used to attach request-specific data to the `Request` object, which can then be accessed by controllers and services. This is a simple and efficient way to pass data around within a single request.

*   **Context Objects:** Create a dedicated context object (e.g., a plain JavaScript object) that holds request-specific data. Pass this context object as an argument to the functions that need it. This approach provides more control over data management and avoids the overhead of dependency injection.

*   **AsyncLocalStorage (Node.js >= 14):** This Node.js feature allows you to store data that is local to the current asynchronous context. It's useful for propagating data across asynchronous calls without explicitly passing it as arguments. NestJS provides an integration for `AsyncLocalStorage`.
