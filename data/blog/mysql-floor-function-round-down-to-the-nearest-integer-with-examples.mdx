# MySQL FLOOR() Function: Round Down to the Nearest Integer (with Examples)

The MySQL `FLOOR()` function is a fundamental numerical function that allows you to round a number down to the nearest integer. This is especially useful in database applications where you need to work with whole numbers or discretize continuous data. This blog post will provide a detailed explanation of the `FLOOR()` function, its syntax, usage, and practical examples to help you effectively use it in your MySQL queries.

## What is the MySQL FLOOR() Function?

The `FLOOR()` function in MySQL takes a single numeric argument and returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the input argument. In simpler terms, it rounds a number _down_ to the nearest whole number.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
FLOOR(X)
```

Where `X` is the numeric value you want to round down. `X` can be a literal number, a column name, or an expression that evaluates to a number.

## Basic Usage and Examples

Let's start with some basic examples to illustrate how the `FLOOR()` function works:

**Example 1: Rounding Down a Positive Number**

```plaintext
SELECT FLOOR(5.75);
```

**Output:**

```
5
```

In this case, 5.75 is rounded down to 5, the largest integer that is less than or equal to 5.75.

**Example 2: Rounding Down a Negative Number**

```plaintext
SELECT FLOOR(-5.75);
```

**Output:**

```
-6
```

When dealing with negative numbers, the `FLOOR()` function returns the next _lower_ integer. Therefore, -5.75 is rounded down to -6 because -6 is less than -5.75.

**Example 3: Rounding an Integer**

```plaintext
SELECT FLOOR(10);
```

**Output:**

```
10
```

If the input is already an integer, the `FLOOR()` function simply returns the same integer.

## Using FLOOR() with Table Data

The `FLOOR()` function becomes much more powerful when used with data stored in tables. Let's assume we have a table called `products` with the following structure:

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES
('Laptop', 1299.99),
('Mouse', 19.50),
('Keyboard', 75.25),
('Monitor', 249.75),
('Headphones', 99.99);
```

Now, we can use `FLOOR()` to round down the prices in our queries.

**Example 4: Displaying the Integer Part of Product Prices**

```plaintext
SELECT name, price, FLOOR(price) AS rounded_price
FROM products;
```

**Output:**

```
+------------+---------+---------------+
| name       | price   | rounded_price |
+------------+---------+---------------+
| Laptop     | 1299.99 |          1299 |
| Mouse      |   19.50 |            19 |
| Keyboard   |   75.25 |            75 |
| Monitor    |  249.75 |           249 |
| Headphones |   99.99 |            99 |
+------------+---------+---------------+
```

This query retrieves the product name, the original price, and the price rounded down to the nearest integer using the `FLOOR()` function. The `AS rounded_price` clause assigns an alias to the calculated column for better readability.

**Example 5: Filtering Products Based on Rounded Price**

We can combine `FLOOR()` with the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on the rounded price. For instance, let's find all products with a rounded price greater than 50:

```plaintext
SELECT name, price
FROM products
WHERE FLOOR(price) > 50;
```

**Output:**

```
+----------+---------+
| name     | price   |
+----------+---------+
| Laptop   | 1299.99 |
| Keyboard |   75.25 |
| Monitor  |  249.75 |
| Headphones |   99.99 |
+----------+---------+
```

This query filters the products to include only those where the integer part of their price is greater than 50.

**Example 6: Calculating Averages with FLOOR()**

You can also use `FLOOR()` in conjunction with other aggregate functions. Let's calculate the average rounded-down price of all products:

```plaintext
SELECT FLOOR(AVG(price)) AS average_rounded_price
FROM products;
```

**Output:**

```
+-----------------------+
| average_rounded_price |
+-----------------------+
|                   348 |
+-----------------------+
```

This query first calculates the average price of all products (which would be approximately 348.996), and then rounds the result down to the nearest integer using `FLOOR()`, giving us 348.

## Common Use Cases for FLOOR()

The `FLOOR()` function has various applications in database development, including:

- **Data Aggregation:** Grouping data into integer-based categories. For instance, grouping customers by their age ranges.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating histograms or other visualizations where you need to discretize continuous data.
- **Inventory Management:** Rounding down quantities for reporting or order processing.
- **Financial Calculations:** Simplifying financial figures for reporting or analysis.
- **Pagination:** Determining the page number based on a record's position in a result set.

## FLOOR() vs. CEILING() vs. ROUND()

It's important to understand the difference between `FLOOR()`, `CEILING()`, and `ROUND()` functions:

- **`FLOOR(X)`:** Rounds _down_ to the nearest integer (towards negative infinity).
- **`CEILING(X)` (or `CEIL(X)`):** Rounds _up_ to the nearest integer (towards positive infinity).
- **`ROUND(X, D)`:** Rounds to `D` decimal places. If `D` is omitted, it rounds to the nearest integer based on standard rounding rules (0.5 and above rounds up, below 0.5 rounds down).

**Example illustrating the differences:**

```plaintext
SELECT
  FLOOR(5.4),
  CEILING(5.4),
  ROUND(5.4),
  FLOOR(5.6),
  CEILING(5.6),
  ROUND(5.6),
  FLOOR(-5.4),
  CEILING(-5.4),
  ROUND(-5.4),
  FLOOR(-5.6),
  CEILING(-5.6),
  ROUND(-5.6);
```

**Output:**

```
+-----------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+------------+-------------+------------+
| FLOOR(5.4) | CEILING(5.4) | ROUND(5.4) | FLOOR(5.6) | CEILING(5.6) | ROUND(5.6) | FLOOR(-5.4) | CEILING(-5.4) | ROUND(-5.4) | FLOOR(-5.6) | CEILING(-5.6) | ROUND(-5.6) |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+------------+-------------+------------+
|         5 |           6 |         5 |         5 |           6 |         6 |         -6 |          -5 |         -5 |         -6 |          -5 |         -6 |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------------+-------------+------------+------------+-------------+------------+
```

Choose the function that best suits your specific rounding requirements.

## Performance Considerations

The `FLOOR()` function is generally a fast operation. However, when used in complex queries or on large datasets, it's important to consider its performance impact. Ensure you have proper indexes on the columns used in conjunction with `FLOOR()` to optimize query execution.

## Conclusion

The MySQL `FLOOR()` function is a valuable tool for rounding numbers down to the nearest integer. By understanding its syntax, usage, and potential applications, you can effectively use it to manipulate data, perform calculations, and create insightful reports in your MySQL databases. Remember to consider the differences between `FLOOR()`, `CEILING()`, and `ROUND()` to choose the most appropriate function for your specific needs. Experiment with the provided examples and adapt them to your own database schemas to gain a deeper understanding of the `FLOOR()` function and its capabilities.
