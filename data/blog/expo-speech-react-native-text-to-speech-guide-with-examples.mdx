# Expo Speech: React Native Text-to-Speech Guide with Examples

Text-to-speech (TTS) functionality is a powerful tool for enhancing the accessibility and user experience of your React Native applications. Expo Speech provides a simple and effective way to implement TTS in your Expo-based projects. This guide will walk you through the installation, configuration, and usage of Expo Speech, complete with code examples and best practices.

## What is Expo Speech?

Expo Speech is an Expo module that allows your React Native applications to convert text into spoken audio. It provides a straightforward API for synthesizing speech and controlling the playback of audio, including adjusting speech rate, pitch, and volume. It's built on top of native platform TTS engines (e.g., Apple's `AVSpeechSynthesizer` and Android's `TextToSpeech`), providing a consistent cross-platform experience.

## Why Use Expo Speech?

- **Accessibility:** Make your app accessible to users with visual impairments or reading difficulties.
- **User Engagement:** Enhance user interaction by providing audio feedback or narrating content.
- **Learning Applications:** Create educational apps that read text aloud to learners.
- **Hands-Free Operation:** Enable users to interact with your app without needing to look at the screen.
- **Simplified Development:** Expo Speech simplifies the complexities of native platform TTS APIs, making it easier to implement in your React Native project.

## Installation

First, make sure you have an Expo project set up. If not, you can create one using the Expo CLI:

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app my-speech-app
cd my-speech-app
```

Next, install the `expo-speech` package:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-speech
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Expo Speech to speak a simple text string:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, TextInput } from 'react-native'
import * as Speech from 'expo-speech'

export default function App() {
  const [textToSpeak, setTextToSpeak] = useState('Hello, world!')

  const speak = () => {
    Speech.speak(textToSpeak)
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Expo Speech Example</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        onChangeText={setTextToSpeak}
        value={textToSpeak}
        placeholder="Enter text to speak"
      />
      <Button title="Speak" onPress={speak} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  input: {
    width: '100%',
    height: 40,
    borderColor: 'gray',
    borderWidth: 1,
    marginBottom: 10,
    paddingHorizontal: 10,
  },
})
```

This code snippet demonstrates the following:

1.  **Importing `expo-speech`:** We import the `expo-speech` module as `Speech`.
2.  **Defining a state variable:** We use `useState` to manage the text that will be spoken. The `textToSpeak` variable holds the text, and `setTextToSpeak` is the function to update it.
3.  **The `speak` function:** This function calls `Speech.speak(textToSpeak)` to initiate the TTS synthesis using the current value of `textToSpeak`.
4.  **UI Elements:** A `TextInput` allows the user to enter the text they want to be spoken, and a `Button` triggers the `speak` function.

## Advanced Options

The `Speech.speak()` function accepts an optional second argument: an object containing configuration options.

```plaintext
Speech.speak('This is a custom speech example.', {
  language: 'en-US', // Specify the language (optional)
  pitch: 1.2, // Adjust the pitch (optional, default is 1.0)
  rate: 0.8, // Adjust the speech rate (optional, default is 1.0)
  volume: 1.0, // Adjust the volume (optional, default is 1.0)
  onDone: () => {
    console.log('Speech finished!')
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Speech error:', error)
  },
})
```

Here's a breakdown of the available options:

- **`language`:** A string specifying the language to use for speech synthesis (e.g., `'en-US'`, `'es-ES'`, `'fr-FR'`). If not specified, the device's default language will be used.

- **`pitch`:** A number between 0.5 and 2.0 that controls the pitch of the synthesized speech. A higher value results in a higher pitch. The default value is 1.0.

- **`rate`:** A number between 0.1 and 2.0 that controls the speed of the synthesized speech. A lower value results in slower speech. The default value is 1.0.

- **`volume`:** A number between 0.0 and 1.0 that controls the volume of the synthesized speech. The default value is 1.0.

- **`onDone`:** A function that is called when the speech synthesis is complete. This is useful for performing actions after the text has been spoken.

- **`onError`:** A function that is called if an error occurs during speech synthesis. This allows you to handle errors gracefully and provide feedback to the user.

**Example with Custom Options:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, TextInput } from 'react-native'
import * as Speech from 'expo-speech'

export default function App() {
  const [textToSpeak, setTextToSpeak] = useState('Hello, world!')

  const speak = () => {
    const options = {
      language: 'en-GB', // British English
      pitch: 1.1,
      rate: 0.9,
      onDone: () => {
        console.log('Speech complete!')
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        console.error('Speech Error:', error)
      },
    }
    Speech.speak(textToSpeak, options)
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Expo Speech Example</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        onChangeText={setTextToSpeak}
        value={textToSpeak}
        placeholder="Enter text to speak"
      />
      <Button title="Speak with Options" onPress={speak} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  input: {
    width: '100%',
    height: 40,
    borderColor: 'gray',
    borderWidth: 1,
    marginBottom: 10,
    paddingHorizontal: 10,
  },
})
```

## Controlling Speech Playback

Expo Speech provides methods for controlling speech playback:

- **`Speech.stop()`:** Stops the current speech synthesis.

  ```plaintext
  Speech.stop()
  ```

- **`Speech.pause()`:** Pauses the current speech synthesis.

  ```plaintext
  Speech.pause()
  ```

- **`Speech.resume()`:** Resumes the paused speech synthesis.

  ```plaintext
  Speech.resume()
  ```

**Example Implementation with Playback Controls:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, TextInput } from 'react-native'
import * as Speech from 'expo-speech'

export default function App() {
  const [textToSpeak, setTextToSpeak] = useState('Hello, world!')
  const [isSpeaking, setIsSpeaking] = useState(false)

  const speak = () => {
    setIsSpeaking(true)
    Speech.speak(textToSpeak, {
      onDone: () => setIsSpeaking(false),
      onError: () => setIsSpeaking(false),
    })
  }

  const stopSpeaking = () => {
    Speech.stop()
    setIsSpeaking(false)
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Expo Speech Example</Text>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        onChangeText={setTextToSpeak}
        value={textToSpeak}
        placeholder="Enter text to speak"
      />
      <Button title="Speak" onPress={speak} disabled={isSpeaking} />
      <Button title="Stop" onPress={stopSpeaking} disabled={!isSpeaking} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  input: {
    width: '100%',
    height: 40,
    borderColor: 'gray',
    borderWidth: 1,
    marginBottom: 10,
    paddingHorizontal: 10,
  },
})
```

In this example:

- We add state `isSpeaking` to disable the "Speak" button while speech is in progress.
- The `speak` function sets `isSpeaking` to true and resets to false when speech finishes or encounters an error using `onDone` and `onError` options.
- The `stopSpeaking` function calls `Speech.stop()` to immediately halt speech and sets `isSpeaking` to `false`.

## Checking if Speech is Available

Before attempting to use Speech features, it's good practice to check if the functionality is available on the current device:

```plaintext
import * as Speech from 'expo-speech';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isSpeechAvailable, setIsSpeechAvailable] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkAvailability = async () => {
      const available = await Speech.isAvailableAsync();
      setIsSpeechAvailable(available);
    };

    checkAvailability();
  }, []);

  return (
    {isSpeechAvailable ? (
        <Text>Speech is available!</Text>
    ) : (
        <Text>Speech is not available on this device.</Text>
    )}
  );
};
```

This code uses `Speech.isAvailableAsync()` to determine if TTS is supported on the device.

## Choosing the Right Voice

While Expo Speech provides a simplified interface, it doesn't expose direct control over selecting specific voices. The available voices and their characteristics depend on the underlying platform's TTS engine.

You can attempt to influence voice selection indirectly through the `language` option. For example, setting `language` to `'en-US'` might use a different voice than setting it to `'en-GB'`. However, the exact voices available and their characteristics are platform-dependent and beyond the direct control of Expo Speech.

## Best Practices for Accessibility

- **Provide alternatives:** Always provide alternative ways for users to access content, such as text transcripts or captions.
- **Use clear and concise language:** Make sure the text you are synthesizing is easy to understand.
- **Consider context:** Think about the context in which the speech will be used. Adjust the pitch, rate, and volume to create a natural and engaging experience.
- **Test with different languages and voices:** Ensure that your application works well with different languages and voices.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors and provide feedback to users if speech synthesis fails.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Speech not working:** Ensure the device has a working internet connection (especially on Android, as some TTS engines rely on online services). Double-check that the device's text-to-speech engine is properly configured.
- **No sound:** Make sure the device's volume is turned up and not muted.
- **Slow speech:** Adjust the `rate` option to a higher value.
- **Incorrect language:** Verify that the `language` option is set correctly.
- **Permissions Issues:** Ensure your app has the necessary permissions to use audio services. Expo should handle this automatically, but it's worth checking.

## Conclusion

Expo Speech provides a simple and effective way to add text-to-speech functionality to your React Native applications. By following the guidelines in this guide, you can create accessible and engaging mobile experiences for your users. Remember to consider accessibility best practices and handle potential errors gracefully. Happy coding!
