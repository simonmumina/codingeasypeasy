# How to Automatically Rotate NGINX Logs: A Comprehensive Guide

NGINX is a powerful and widely used web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.  Managing its logs effectively is crucial for monitoring performance, debugging issues, and maintaining security.  Over time, NGINX logs can grow significantly, consuming valuable disk space and making analysis cumbersome.  This is where log rotation comes in.  Log rotation automatically archives old log files and creates new ones, preventing logs from becoming excessively large and simplifying log management. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of how to automatically rotate NGINX logs using `logrotate` on Linux systems.

## Why Rotate NGINX Logs?

Before we dive into the how-to, let's quickly review why log rotation is essential:

*   **Disk Space Management:** Rotating logs prevents them from consuming all available disk space.
*   **Improved Performance:** Smaller log files are faster to analyze and search.
*   **Simplified Analysis:**  Archiving logs into manageable chunks makes it easier to identify trends and pinpoint issues within specific timeframes.
*   **Security Compliance:** Many security standards and regulations require log rotation to ensure proper audit trails.

## What is `logrotate`?

`logrotate` is a command-line utility available on most Linux systems that automates the process of rotating, compressing, and removing log files. It's highly configurable and can be customized to meet specific requirements. We'll be using `logrotate` to manage our NGINX logs.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Rotating NGINX Logs

Here's how to set up automatic NGINX log rotation using `logrotate`:

**1. Verify `logrotate` is Installed:**

First, check if `logrotate` is installed on your system. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
logrotate --version
```

If `logrotate` is not installed, you'll need to install it using your system's package manager.

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install logrotate
    ```

*   **CentOS/RHEL:**

    ```bash
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install logrotate
    ```

*   **Fedora:**

    ```bash
    sudo dnf update
    sudo dnf install logrotate
    ```

**2. Create an NGINX `logrotate` Configuration File:**

The default location for `logrotate` configuration files is `/etc/logrotate.d/`. Create a new file named `nginx` within this directory:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
```

**3. Configure the `logrotate` File:**

Now, add the following configuration to the `nginx` file.  This is a basic configuration, and we'll discuss the options in detail afterward.

```
/var/log/nginx/*.log {
        daily
        rotate 7
        missingok
        notifempty
        delaycompress
        compress
        postrotate
                if [ -f /var/run/nginx.pid ]; then
                        kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx.pid`
                else
                        /usr/sbin/nginx -s reopen
                fi
        endscript
}
```

Let's break down each option:

*   `/var/log/nginx/*.log`: This specifies the log files to be rotated. In this case, it rotates all files ending with `.log` in the `/var/log/nginx/` directory. **Adjust this path if your NGINX logs are located elsewhere.**
*   `daily`: This option specifies that logs should be rotated daily.  Other options include `weekly`, `monthly`, and `yearly`.
*   `rotate 7`: This option specifies that `logrotate` should keep 7 rotated logs.  The older logs will be deleted.
*   `missingok`: This option tells `logrotate` to continue processing even if a log file is missing.
*   `notifempty`: This option prevents rotation if the log file is empty.
*   `delaycompress`: This option delays compression of the previous log file until the next rotation cycle. This is useful for avoiding potential issues with programs that are still writing to the old log file.
*   `compress`: This option compresses rotated log files using gzip by default. You can specify a different compression algorithm if needed (e.g., `bzip2`).
*   `postrotate` and `endscript`:  This section defines a script that runs after the log rotation. The script sends a `USR1` signal to the NGINX process (if the PID file exists) to tell it to reopen its log files.  This ensures that NGINX starts writing to the new log files.  If the PID file doesn't exist, the script tries to reopen the logs using the NGINX executable.

**Important Considerations for the `postrotate` script:**

*   **NGINX PID File:** Ensure that the path to the NGINX PID file (`/var/run/nginx.pid`) is correct for your system.  You can usually find this in your NGINX configuration file (often `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`).
*   **NGINX Executable Path:**  Confirm the path to the NGINX executable (`/usr/sbin/nginx`) is correct. Use `which nginx` to determine the actual path.
*   **Permissions:**  The user running `logrotate` needs permissions to execute the commands within the `postrotate` script.  Typically, `logrotate` runs as root, so this is usually not an issue.

**4. Save the Configuration File:**

Save the changes to the `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx` file.

**5. Test the Configuration (Dry Run):**

Before allowing `logrotate` to run automatically, it's crucial to test your configuration.  This will help you identify any errors or issues.  Use the following command:

```bash
sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
```

The `-d` option puts `logrotate` in debug mode. It will simulate the rotation process and print detailed output to the console without actually modifying any files.  Carefully review the output to ensure everything is working as expected.  Pay attention to any error messages.

**6. Manually Run `logrotate` (First Run):**

After verifying the configuration with the dry run, run `logrotate` manually to perform the initial log rotation:

```bash
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
```

The `-f` (force) option forces `logrotate` to run, even if it hasn't reached its scheduled rotation time.  This is useful for testing the configuration and ensuring the `postrotate` script works correctly. Check the NGINX log directory (`/var/log/nginx/`) to verify that the logs have been rotated and compressed as expected.

**7. Schedule `logrotate` (Automatic Execution):**

`logrotate` is typically run daily by a cron job. On most systems, a cron job is already configured to run `logrotate`. The main `logrotate` configuration file is usually located at `/etc/logrotate.conf`. This file typically includes a line similar to:

```
include /etc/logrotate.d
```

This line instructs `logrotate` to read all the configuration files in the `/etc/logrotate.d/` directory, including the `nginx` configuration file you created earlier.

To confirm that `logrotate` is scheduled, check the cron jobs:

*   **System-wide cron jobs:**  These are usually located in `/etc/cron.daily/`, `/etc/cron.weekly/`, and `/etc/cron.monthly/`.  Look for a script named `logrotate` or similar.
*   **User-specific cron jobs:**  These are managed using the `crontab` command.  Run `crontab -l` to list the current user's cron jobs.

In most cases, `logrotate` is configured to run daily via `/etc/cron.daily/logrotate`.  You usually don't need to modify this.  However, if you need to adjust the frequency or timing of `logrotate`, you can edit the corresponding cron script.

**8. Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**

*   **Check `logrotate` logs:** `logrotate` usually logs its activity.  The location of the log file depends on your system's configuration, but it's often `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`. Check these logs for any errors or warnings related to log rotation.
*   **Verify log file permissions:** Ensure that the user running NGINX has the correct permissions to write to the new log files after rotation.
*   **Test the `postrotate` script independently:** If you suspect there's an issue with the `postrotate` script, try running the commands within the script manually to isolate the problem.
*   **Use `logrotate` in verbose mode:**  Adding the `-v` option to the `logrotate` command (e.g., `sudo logrotate -v /etc/logrotate.d/nginx`) provides more detailed output, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

## Advanced Configuration Options

Here are some additional `logrotate` options that you might find useful:

*   `size <size>`:  Rotate logs when they reach a specific size.  For example, `size 100M` rotates the log when it reaches 100 megabytes.  This option can be used in conjunction with `daily`, `weekly`, etc.

    ```
    /var/log/nginx/*.log {
        size 100M
        rotate 7
        ...
    }
    ```

*   `dateext`:  Append a date to the rotated log file name instead of a numerical index (e.g., `access.log-20241026` instead of `access.log.1`).

    ```
    /var/log/nginx/*.log {
        dateext
        rotate 7
        ...
    }
    ```

*   `dateformat <format>`:  Specify the format for the date appended to the rotated log file name.  Requires `dateext` to be enabled.

    ```
    /var/log/nginx/*.log {
        dateext
        dateformat -%Y-%m-%d-%s # Includes timestamp to prevent conflicts with logs rotated multiple times in a day.
        rotate 7
        ...
    }
    ```

*   `sharedscripts`:  Run the `prerotate` and `postrotate` scripts only once for all log files that match the specified pattern.  This is useful if you're rotating multiple log files that require the same actions.

    ```
    /var/log/nginx/*.log {
        sharedscripts
        rotate 7
        postrotate
                ...
        endscript
        ...
    }
    ```

*   `create <mode> <owner> <group>`: Create the log file after rotation with the specified mode (permissions), owner, and group.  For example, `create 644 nginx nginx` creates the new log file with permissions 644, owned by the user `nginx` and group `nginx`.  **Use this carefully to avoid security issues. Ensure the specified owner and group are appropriate.**

    ```
    /var/log/nginx/*.log {
        create 644 nginx nginx
        rotate 7
        ...
    }
    ```

*   `maxage <count>`: Remove rotated logs older than `<count>` days. Use instead of rotate if you want to keep logs for a specific period of time.

    ```
    /var/log/nginx/*.log {
        maxage 30 # Keep logs for 30 days.  Older logs will be removed.
        ...
    }
    ```

## Security Considerations

*   **Permissions:** Ensure that the `logrotate` configuration file and the log files themselves have appropriate permissions.  The configuration file should be readable only by root.  The log files should be writable by the NGINX user and readable by the user or group responsible for log analysis.
*   **Log File Locations:** Be mindful of where you store your NGINX logs.  Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text logs.
*   **Encryption:** Consider encrypting rotated log files, especially if they contain sensitive data.  You can use tools like `gpg` or `openssl` to encrypt the archives.  You can integrate encryption into the `postrotate` script.  However, remember that you'll need a corresponding `prerotate` script for decryption when analysing logs.
*   **Auditing:**  Regularly audit your log rotation configuration and processes to ensure they are functioning correctly and securely.

## Example Configurations:

**Example 1: Rotating logs daily, keeping 14 days worth, using date extensions, and compressing with gzip:**

```
/var/log/nginx/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 14
    missingok
    notifempty
    delaycompress
    compress
    dateext
    dateformat -%Y%m%d
    postrotate
        if [ -f /var/run/nginx.pid ]; then
            kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx.pid`
        else
            /usr/sbin/nginx -s reopen
        fi
    endscript
}
```

**Example 2: Rotating logs when they reach 50MB, keeping 5 rotated logs, and using bzip2 for compression:**

```
/var/log/nginx/*.log {
    size 50M
    rotate 5
    missingok
    notifempty
    delaycompress
    compress
    compresscmd /usr/bin/bzip2
    uncompresscmd /usr/bin/bunzip2
    postrotate
        if [ -f /var/run/nginx.pid ]; then
            kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx.pid`
        else
            /usr/sbin/nginx -s reopen
        fi
    endscript
}
```

**Example 3:  Rotating logs monthly, keeping logs for 6 months, creating new log files with specific permissions and ownership:**

```
/var/log/nginx/*.log {
    monthly
    maxage 180  # Approximately 6 months (180 days)
    missingok
    notifempty
    delaycompress
    compress
    create 640 nginx adm  # Change owner and group accordingly
    postrotate
        if [ -f /var/run/nginx.pid ]; then
            kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx.pid`
        else
            /usr/sbin/nginx -s reopen
        fi
    endscript
}
```
