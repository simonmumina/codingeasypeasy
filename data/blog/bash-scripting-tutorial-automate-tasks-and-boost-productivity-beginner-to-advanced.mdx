# Bash Scripting Tutorial: Automate Tasks and Boost Productivity (Beginner to Advanced)

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks, managing systems, and improving workflow efficiency. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or just a curious user, learning Bash scripting can significantly enhance your productivity on Linux and macOS environments. This comprehensive tutorial covers everything from the basics to more advanced concepts, complete with practical examples.

## What is Bash?

Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command language.  It's a command processor that runs in a text window where the user types commands. These commands instruct the operating system to perform actions.  Bash is also a programming language, allowing you to write scripts that automate sequences of commands.

## Why Learn Bash Scripting?

*   **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.
*   **System Administration:** Manage servers, monitor system performance, and automate maintenance tasks.
*   **Development:**  Build tools, automate build processes, and deploy applications.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Bash scripts can often be run on different Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, etc.).
*   **Ubiquity:** Bash is pre-installed on most Linux distributions and is easily available on macOS.

## Getting Started with Bash

### Creating Your First Script

1.  **Open a Text Editor:** Use any text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `Visual Studio Code`, `Sublime Text`).
2.  **Write the Script:** Start with the shebang line `#!/bin/bash` to specify the interpreter.  This is crucial!
3.  **Save the File:** Save the file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `my_script.sh`).
4.  **Make the Script Executable:**  Use the `chmod` command: `chmod +x my_script.sh`.
5.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script using `./my_script.sh`.

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
```

**Explanation:**

*   `#!/bin/bash`:  Specifies that the script should be executed using the Bash interpreter.
*   `echo "Hello, World!"`:  Prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Running Your Script

After saving the script (e.g., `hello.sh`) and making it executable (`chmod +x hello.sh`), you can run it in several ways:

*   `./hello.sh`: Runs the script from the current directory.
*   `bash hello.sh`:  Explicitly tells bash to execute the script.  This doesn't require the `chmod +x` command to be used.
*   If the script is in a directory in your `PATH`, you can run it simply by typing `hello.sh`.  Adding a directory to your `PATH` is beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial, but it's a helpful concept for long-term Bash usage.

## Basic Bash Scripting Concepts

### Variables

Variables store data that can be used in your script.  Variable names are case-sensitive.

*   **Assignment:** `variable_name="value"` (Note: no spaces around the `=` sign).
*   **Accessing:** `${variable_name}` or `$variable_name` (the curly braces are optional in simple cases, but recommended for clarity, especially when concatenating).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

NAME="John Doe"
echo "Hello, my name is ${NAME}."

AGE=30
echo "I am $AGE years old."

# Example of concatenation, curly braces are necessary here:
FILE_EXTENSION="txt"
FILE_NAME="my_file"
FULL_FILENAME="${FILE_NAME}.${FILE_EXTENSION}"
echo "Full filename: $FULL_FILENAME"
```

### Input and Output (I/O)

*   `echo`:  Prints text to the console.
*   `read`:  Reads input from the user.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Please enter your name:"
read USERNAME

echo "Hello, ${USERNAME}!"
```

### Command Substitution

Command substitution allows you to use the output of a command as a variable.

*   `` `command` `` (backticks - generally discouraged)
*   `$(command)` (preferred - easier to read and nest)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

DATE=$(date)
echo "Current date: ${DATE}"

# Example with a different command
FILES=$(ls -l) # List files with details.
echo "Files in this directory:"
echo "$FILES"  # Prints output as one line
```

### Comments

Comments are used to explain your code and are ignored by the interpreter.

*   Single-line comments start with `#`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment.
echo "This is a line of code." # This is also a comment.
```

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements (if, then, else, elif)

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

NUMBER=10

if [ $NUMBER -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 5."
elif [ $NUMBER -eq 5 ]; then
  echo "Number is equal to 5."
else
  echo "Number is less than 5."
fi
```

**Explanation:**

*   `if [ condition ]; then`:  Starts the `if` block.  The `[` and `]` are equivalent to the `test` command. Note the spaces around the brackets.
*   `-gt`:  Greater than.
*   `-eq`:  Equal to.
*   `-lt`:  Less than.
*   `-ge`:  Greater than or equal to.
*   `-le`:  Less than or equal to.
*   `-ne`:  Not equal to.
*   `elif [ condition ]; then`:  An "else if" condition.
*   `else`:  The "else" block, executed if none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are true.
*   `fi`:  Ends the `if` block.

**String comparisons:**

*   `=` or `==`: Equal to
*   `!=`: Not equal to
*   `-z string`: True if the string is null (empty)
*   `-n string`: True if the string is not null

```bash
#!/bin/bash

CITY="London"

if [ "$CITY" == "London" ]; then
  echo "Welcome to London!"
fi
```

### Loops (for, while, until)

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

#### For Loop

The `for` loop iterates over a list of items.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for FRUIT in apple banana cherry; do
  echo "I like $FRUIT."
done
```

Another common `for` loop iterates over a sequence of numbers:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 1 5); do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

#### While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

COUNT=1

while [ $COUNT -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Count: $COUNT"
  COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))  # Increment the counter
done
```

#### Until Loop

The `until` loop executes a block of code until a condition is true.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

COUNT=1

until [ $COUNT -gt 5 ]; do
  echo "Count: $COUNT"
  COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
done
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code.

*   **Definition:**

    ```bash
    function function_name() {
      # Code to be executed
    }
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    function_name() {
      # Code to be executed
    }
    ```

*   **Calling:** `function_name`
*   **Arguments:** Accessed using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
*   **Return Value:**  `return value` (The return value is limited to an integer between 0 and 255.  Use `echo` for more complex returns).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "Alice"
greet "Bob"

# Example of a function that returns a value
function add() {
  local num1=$1
  local num2=$2
  local sum=$((num1 + num2))
  echo "$sum" # Echo the result, not use return
}

result=$(add 5 3)
echo "The sum of 5 and 3 is: $result"
```

## Input Parameters and Arguments

When you run a script, you can pass arguments to it.  These arguments are accessed within the script using `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, and so on.  `$0` represents the name of the script itself. `$#` stores the number of arguments passed to the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"

# Example usage: ./my_script.sh arg1 arg2
```

## Working with Files and Directories

### Basic File Operations

*   `ls`:  List files and directories.
*   `cd`:  Change directory.
*   `mkdir`:  Create a directory.
*   `rmdir`:  Remove an empty directory.
*   `touch`:  Create an empty file.
*   `rm`:  Remove a file.
*   `cp`:  Copy a file.
*   `mv`:  Move or rename a file.
*   `cat`:  Display the contents of a file.
*   `grep`:  Search for a pattern in a file.

### Example: Creating a Backup Script

This script creates a backup of a specified file or directory to a backup directory.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the source and destination directories are provided
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <source> <destination>"
  exit 1
fi

SOURCE="$1"
DESTINATION="$2"

# Check if the source exists
if [ ! -e "$SOURCE" ]; then
  echo "Error: Source '$SOURCE' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Create the destination directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$DESTINATION"

# Get the filename or directory name from the source
FILENAME=$(basename "$SOURCE")

# Create the backup filename with timestamp
BACKUP_FILENAME="${FILENAME}_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

# Copy the source to the destination with the backup filename
cp -r "$SOURCE" "$DESTINATION/$BACKUP_FILENAME"

# Check if the copy was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Backup created successfully: $DESTINATION/$BACKUP_FILENAME"
else
  echo "Error: Backup failed."
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

**Explanation:**

*   `-e`: Tests if a file or directory exists.
*   `basename`: Extracts the filename from a path.
*   `date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`:  Formats the date and time.
*   `cp -r`:  Copies a file or directory recursively.
*   `$?`:  The exit status of the last command.  `0` indicates success.
*   `exit`:  Exits the script.

## Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions are patterns used to match strings.  Bash provides limited built-in regex support, but tools like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` are commonly used for more advanced regex operations.

**Basic Regex Symbols:**

*   `.`:  Matches any single character.
*   `*`:  Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
*   `+`:  Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.  (Requires `grep -E` or `egrep`)
*   `?`:  Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.  (Requires `grep -E` or `egrep`)
*   `^`:  Matches the beginning of a line.
*   `$`:  Matches the end of a line.
*   `[]`:  Matches any character within the brackets.
*   `[^]`:  Matches any character not within the brackets.
*   `\`:  Escapes a special character.

**Example using `grep`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

TEXT="This is a line of text with numbers 123 and 456."

# Find lines containing numbers
grep "[0-9]+" <<< "$TEXT"

# Find lines starting with "This"
grep "^This" <<< "$TEXT"

# Find lines ending with "."
grep "\.$" <<< "$TEXT"
```

**Explanation:**

*   `grep "[0-9]+" <<< "$TEXT"`:  Searches the string `$TEXT` for a pattern of one or more digits (`[0-9]+`). The `<<<` operator is a "here string" that sends the string as input to the `grep` command.
*   `grep "^This" <<< "$TEXT"`:  Searches for lines starting with "This".
*   `grep "\.$" <<< "$TEXT"`:  Searches for lines ending with a period.  The period needs to be escaped with a backslash because it's a special character in regex.

## Debugging Bash Scripts

Debugging is crucial for identifying and fixing errors in your scripts.

*   **`set -x`:**  Enable tracing.  Prints each command before it's executed.
*   **`set -e`:**  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status (an error).  This prevents the script from continuing after an error.
*   **`set -u`:**  Treat unset variables as errors.  This helps catch typos and undefined variables.
*   **`echo` statements:**  Insert `echo` statements to print the values of variables and track the script's execution.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x # Enable tracing

NUMBER=10

if [ $NUMBER -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 5."
else
  echo "Number is less than or equal to 5."
fi

set +x # Disable tracing
```

## Best Practices for Bash Scripting

*   **Use descriptive variable names.**
*   **Comment your code liberally.**
*   **Handle errors gracefully.**
*   **Quote your variables to prevent word splitting and globbing.**  (Especially important when dealing with filenames that contain spaces.)
*   **Use functions to break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable units.**
*   **Test your scripts thoroughly.**
*   **Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `#!/bin/bash` for better portability.** This relies on the user's `PATH` to locate the bash executable.  However, it's not strictly required.
*   **Consider using a linter like `shellcheck` to identify potential issues.**
*   **Store sensitive data (passwords, API keys) in environment variables or external configuration files, not directly in the script.**

## Advanced Topics (Beyond this Tutorial)

*   **`sed` and `awk`:**  Powerful text processing tools.
*   **`xargs`:**  Build and execute command lines from standard input.
*   **Process management (background processes, signals).**
*   **Working with arrays.**
*   **Networking with `curl` and `wget`.**
*   **Systemd service files for managing scripts as services.**
