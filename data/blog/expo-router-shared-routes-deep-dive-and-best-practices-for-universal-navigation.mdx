# Expo Router Shared Routes: Deep Dive & Best Practices for Universal Navigation

Expo Router has revolutionized navigation in React Native, bringing the familiarity of file-based routing from web frameworks like Next.js to the mobile world. One of its most powerful features is _shared routes_, enabling you to create a single navigation structure that works across iOS, Android, and the web. This eliminates platform-specific code and significantly simplifies your development workflow. This comprehensive guide dives deep into shared routes, covering everything from basic setup to advanced techniques.

## What are Expo Router Shared Routes?

Shared routes allow you to define your app's navigation structure using files and folders within the `app` directory of your Expo project. Expo Router automatically generates the necessary navigation code based on these files, enabling seamless transitions between screens on all supported platforms. This approach promotes code reusability, improves maintainability, and simplifies the overall navigation management within your application.

**Key benefits of using shared routes:**

- **Cross-platform consistency:** Define your navigation logic once and deploy it across iOS, Android, and web.
- **Improved developer experience:** File-based routing is intuitive and easy to understand, especially for developers familiar with web frameworks.
- **Simplified deep linking:** Expo Router automatically handles deep linking based on your file structure.
- **Code reusability:** Shared components and logic can be easily used across all screens.
- **Enhanced maintainability:** Centralized navigation logic makes it easier to update and debug your app's navigation.
- **SEO Optimization:** Web support with shared routes enhances the discoverability of your app through search engines.

## Setting Up Expo Router

Before diving into shared routes, you'll need to set up Expo Router in your project. If you're starting a new project, you can use the Expo CLI to create a new project with Expo Router pre-installed:

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app -t expo-router
```

If you have an existing Expo project, you can install Expo Router and configure it manually:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-status-bar
npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler  # Optional: For drawer navigation, stacks with gestures

# Add the necessary plugins to your app.json or app.config.js
# For example:
#   "plugins": [
#     "expo-router"
#   ]

```

Ensure you update your `app.json` or `app.config.js` to include the `expo-router` plugin:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "plugins": ["expo-router"]
  }
}
```

## Building Your Navigation with Shared Routes

The core of shared routes lies in the `app` directory. Here's how to structure your app's navigation using files and folders:

- **Files:** Represent screens or routes. The filename determines the route segment. For example, `app/index.js` represents the root route (`/`).
- **Folders:** Create nested routes. A folder named `settings` in `app` would create a route segment `/settings`.
- **`_layout.js` (or `_layout.tsx`):** Define a layout component that wraps its children routes. Useful for shared headers, footers, and navigation bars.
- **`[dynamic].js` (or `[dynamic].tsx`):** Create dynamic routes with parameters. For example, `app/blog/[slug].js` would create a route like `/blog/my-first-post`.
- **`index.js` (or `index.tsx`):** Within a directory, this file creates a route for the directory itself. For example, within `app/blog`, `app/blog/index.js` would create a route `/blog`.

**Example:**

Let's create a simple app with the following navigation structure:

- `/` (Home)
- `/about` (About Us)
- `/blog` (Blog Listing)
- `/blog/[slug]` (Blog Post Detail)
- `/settings` (Settings Page)

Here's the corresponding file structure within the `app` directory:

```
app/
├── _layout.js
├── index.js
├── about.js
├── blog/
│   ├── _layout.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── [slug].js
└── settings.js
```

**Code Examples:**

**`app/_layout.js`:**

```javascript
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context'

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <Stack>{/* Define any default options for your screens here */}</Stack>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  )
}
```

**`app/index.js`:**

```javascript
import { Link } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function HomeScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Welcome to my App!</Text>
      <Link href="/about" style={styles.link}>
        Go to About Us
      </Link>
      <Link href="/blog" style={styles.link}>
        View Blog
      </Link>
      <Link href="/settings" style={styles.link}>
        Settings
      </Link>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  title: { fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: 16 },
  link: { fontSize: 16, color: 'blue', marginVertical: 8 },
})
```

**`app/about.js`:**

```javascript
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function AboutScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>About Us</Text>
      <Text>This is the About Us screen.</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  title: { fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: 16 },
})
```

**`app/blog/index.js`:**

```javascript
import { Link } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

const blogPosts = [
  { slug: 'first-post', title: 'My First Blog Post' },
  { slug: 'second-post', title: 'Another Interesting Post' },
]

export default function BlogListingScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Blog Posts</Text>
      {blogPosts.map((post) => (
        <Link key={post.slug} href={`/blog/${post.slug}`} style={styles.link}>
          {post.title}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  title: { fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: 16 },
  link: { fontSize: 16, color: 'blue', marginVertical: 8 },
})
```

**`app/blog/[slug].js`:**

```javascript
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function BlogPostScreen() {
  const { slug } = useLocalSearchParams()

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Blog Post: {slug}</Text>
      <Text>Content of the blog post with slug: {slug}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  title: { fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: 16 },
})
```

**`app/settings.js`:**

```javascript
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function SettingsScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Settings</Text>
      <Text>This is the Settings screen.</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  title: { fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold', marginBottom: 16 },
})
```

This example demonstrates how to create a basic navigation structure using shared routes. You can use the `<Link>` component from `expo-router` to navigate between screens. The `useLocalSearchParams` hook is used to access the route parameters in dynamic routes like `/blog/[slug]`.

## Deep Linking and Universal Links

Expo Router simplifies deep linking and universal links, allowing users to access specific screens directly from a URL. When a user clicks a link to your app, Expo Router will automatically route them to the corresponding screen based on your file structure.

**Configuration:**

You need to configure your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) with the correct scheme for deep linking. This scheme will be used to create the URLs that will open your app.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "scheme": "myapp", // Define your custom scheme
    "plugins": ["expo-router"],
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp",
      "associatedDomains": ["applinks:example.com"] // For Universal Links
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.myapp",
      "intentFilters": [
        {
          "action": "android.intent.action.VIEW",
          "data": [
            {
              "scheme": "myapp",
              "host": null
            }
          ],
          "category": ["android.intent.category.DEFAULT", "android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"]
        }
      ]
    },
    "web": {
      "build": {
        "publicPath": "/"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`scheme`:** Defines the URL scheme for deep linking (e.g., `myapp://`).
- **`ios.associatedDomains`:** Configures Universal Links on iOS. Replace `example.com` with your domain. You'll also need to set up the `apple-app-site-association` file on your server.
- **`android.intentFilters`:** Configures intent filters for deep linking on Android.
- **`web.build.publicPath`**: Configures where your web app is located. "/" is the root.

**Example Deep Link:**

If you have a blog post with the slug `my-first-post`, the deep link would be:

`myapp://blog/my-first-post`

When a user clicks this link on a device with your app installed, Expo Router will automatically navigate them to the `/blog/[slug].js` screen with `slug` set to `my-first-post`.

**Universal Links (iOS) and App Links (Android):**

These are more secure and preferred methods for deep linking. They use your website domain to verify the association between your app and the link. Setting them up requires additional steps beyond configuring `app.json`, including hosting an `apple-app-site-association` file (iOS) on your website and verifying your app's package name in the Google Play Console (Android). Expo's documentation has detailed guides on setting these up.

## Linking Configuration with `usePathname` and `useRouter`

For more complex navigation scenarios, you can use the `usePathname` and `useRouter` hooks from `expo-router`.

- **`usePathname`:** Returns the current route pathname.
- **`useRouter`:** Provides a router object with methods for navigating programmatically.

**Example:**

```javascript
import { usePathname, useRouter } from 'expo-router'
import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native'

export default function ConditionalNavigation() {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleNavigate = () => {
    if (pathname === '/about') {
      router.push('/') // Navigate to home if on the about page
    } else {
      router.push('/about') // Navigate to about otherwise
    }
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Current Path: {pathname}</Text>
      <Button title="Toggle Navigation" onPress={handleNavigate} />
    </View>
  )
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use `usePathname` to determine the current route and `useRouter` to navigate to a different screen based on the current path.

## Layout Routes (`_layout.js`): Building Shared UI

Layout routes are essential for creating consistent UI elements across multiple screens. A `_layout.js` (or `_layout.tsx`) file defines a layout component that wraps all child routes within its directory.

**Example:**

**`app/_layout.js`:**

```javascript
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

function Header() {
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0' }}>
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>My App Header</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Stack />
    </>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `Header` component will be displayed at the top of every screen within the `app` directory. The `<Stack />` component from `expo-router` renders the actual screens. You can use this approach to create shared headers, footers, navigation drawers, tab bars, and other UI elements.

**Nesting Layouts:**

You can also nest layout routes to create more complex UI structures. For example, you might have a root layout with a global header and footer, and then a nested layout for a specific section of your app with a different navigation bar.

## Best Practices for Shared Routes

- **Keep your file structure organized:** A clear and logical file structure is crucial for maintaining a large and complex app.
- **Use layout routes for shared UI:** Avoid duplicating UI code across multiple screens by using layout routes to create shared components.
- **Configure deep linking correctly:** Ensure that your `app.json` is properly configured for deep linking and universal links.
- **Test your navigation thoroughly:** Test your navigation on all supported platforms (iOS, Android, and web) to ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Leverage TypeScript for type safety:** Use TypeScript to add type safety to your routes and navigation logic.
- **Consider using a state management library:** For complex state management scenarios, consider using a library like Redux or Zustand to manage your app's state across multiple screens.
- **Use environment variables for different environments:** For example, you could use environment variables to configure different API endpoints for development, staging, and production environments.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Deep links not working:** Double-check your `app.json` configuration, especially the `scheme`, `ios.associatedDomains`, and `android.intentFilters` properties. Also, verify your website setup for Universal Links (iOS) and App Links (Android).
- **Navigation not working as expected:** Carefully review your file structure and ensure that your routes are defined correctly. Use the `console.log` statement to debug the current path and route parameters.
- **Layout routes not applying correctly:** Check the nesting of your layout routes and make sure that they are properly configured.
- **Web builds failing:** Verify that your `web.build.publicPath` in `app.json` is correctly set up. Also, ensure you're using the latest versions of Expo Router and related packages.
