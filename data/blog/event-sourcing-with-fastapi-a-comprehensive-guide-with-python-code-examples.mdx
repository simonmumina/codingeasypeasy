# Event Sourcing with FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide with Python Code Examples

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that offers significant advantages over traditional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) database approaches. This article will guide you through understanding and implementing Event Sourcing with FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

## What is Event Sourcing?

Instead of storing the current state of an entity, Event Sourcing persists each state change as an immutable "event". These events represent facts that occurred in the system. The current state of an entity is then derived by replaying the sequence of events related to that entity.

Think of it like an accounting ledger. Instead of overwriting the balance after each transaction, you record each transaction (credit or debit). The current balance is calculated by summing all the transactions.

### Key Concepts:

- **Events:** Immutable records of state changes. Examples: `OrderCreated`, `OrderShipped`, `PaymentReceived`.
- **Event Store:** The durable repository where events are persisted. This can be a specialized database or a message queue.
- **Aggregate:** A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An `Order` could be an aggregate.
- **Projection:** Creating read-optimized data models (often called "read models") by processing the events from the Event Store. This supports the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.

## Why Use Event Sourcing?

Event Sourcing offers several compelling advantages:

- **Audit Trail:** A complete and accurate history of all changes. This is invaluable for debugging, auditing, and regulatory compliance.
- **Replayability:** The ability to reconstruct past states of the system. This is crucial for debugging, testing, and understanding system behavior over time.
- **Temporal Queries:** Retrieve data as it existed at a specific point in time.
- **CQRS Integration:** Event Sourcing naturally complements the CQRS pattern, allowing for optimized read models.
- **Microservices Compatibility:** Events can be used to communicate state changes between microservices, enabling loose coupling and improved scalability.

## Implementing Event Sourcing with FastAPI

Let's walk through a practical example of implementing Event Sourcing with FastAPI. We'll build a simple "Order Management" system.

### 1. Project Setup

First, create a new Python project and install the necessary dependencies:

```plaintext
mkdir fastapi-event-sourcing
cd fastapi-event-sourcing
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### 2. Defining Events

Define the events that represent state changes in our Order aggregate:

```plaintext
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Dict, Any
import datetime

class Event(BaseModel):
    event_type: str
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime.datetime = datetime.datetime.utcnow()

class OrderCreated(Event):
    event_type = "OrderCreated"

class OrderShipped(Event):
    event_type = "OrderShipped"

class PaymentReceived(Event):
    event_type = "PaymentReceived"
```

### 3. Defining the Aggregate (Order)

The `Order` class represents our aggregate and is responsible for applying events to update its state.

```plaintext
from typing import List, Optional

class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_id: Optional[str] = None, customer_id: Optional[str] = None, items: Optional[List[str]] = None, shipped: bool = False, paid: bool = False):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.items = items or []
        self.shipped = shipped
        self.paid = paid

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, order_id: str, customer_id: str, items: List[str]) -> "Order":
        order = cls(order_id=order_id, customer_id=customer_id, items=items)
        return order

    def apply(self, event: Event):
        if event.event_type == "OrderCreated":
            self.order_id = event.data['order_id']
            self.customer_id = event.data['customer_id']
            self.items = event.data['items']
        elif event.event_type == "OrderShipped":
            self.shipped = True
        elif event.event_type == "PaymentReceived":
            self.paid = True

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            "order_id": self.order_id,
            "customer_id": self.customer_id,
            "items": self.items,
            "shipped": self.shipped,
            "paid": self.paid,
        }
```

### 4. Event Store Interface

We'll define an interface for interacting with the Event Store. This allows us to abstract the underlying storage mechanism.

```plaintext
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List

class EventStore(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def append(self, order_id: str, events: List[Event]):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_events(self, order_id: str) -> List[Event]:
        pass
```

### 5. In-Memory Event Store (for demonstration)

For simplicity, we'll use an in-memory Event Store for this example. In a real-world application, you would use a persistent storage solution like PostgreSQL with an event store library (e.g., `event-store`).

```plaintext
class InMemoryEventStore(EventStore):
    def __init__(self):
        self.events: Dict[str, List[Event]] = {}

    def append(self, order_id: str, events: List[Event]):
        if order_id not in self.events:
            self.events[order_id] = []
        self.events[order_id].extend(events)

    def get_events(self, order_id: str) -> List[Event]:
        return self.events.get(order_id, [])
```

### 6. FastAPI API Endpoints

Now, let's create the FastAPI endpoints to interact with our Order Management system.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
import uuid

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize the Event Store
event_store = InMemoryEventStore()


class OrderCreateRequest(BaseModel):
    customer_id: str
    items: List[str]


@app.post("/orders/")
async def create_order(order_request: OrderCreateRequest):
    order_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    order_created_event = OrderCreated(data={
        "order_id": order_id,
        "customer_id": order_request.customer_id,
        "items": order_request.items
    })

    event_store.append(order_id, [order_created_event])
    return {"order_id": order_id, "message": "Order created successfully"}


@app.post("/orders/{order_id}/ship")
async def ship_order(order_id: str):
    order = rebuild_order_from_events(order_id)
    if not order:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Order not found")

    if order.shipped:
        return {"message": "Order already shipped"}

    order_shipped_event = OrderShipped(data={})
    event_store.append(order_id, [order_shipped_event])
    return {"message": "Order shipped successfully"}


@app.post("/orders/{order_id}/pay")
async def pay_order(order_id: str):
    order = rebuild_order_from_events(order_id)
    if not order:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Order not found")

    if order.paid:
        return {"message": "Order already paid"}

    payment_received_event = PaymentReceived(data={})
    event_store.append(order_id, [payment_received_event])
    return {"message": "Payment received successfully"}


@app.get("/orders/{order_id}")
async def get_order(order_id: str):
    order = rebuild_order_from_events(order_id)
    if not order:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Order not found")

    return order.to_dict()



def rebuild_order_from_events(order_id: str) -> Optional[Order]:
    events = event_store.get_events(order_id)
    if not events:
        return None

    order = Order() # Create empty order
    for event in events:
        order.apply(event)
    return order
```

### 7. Running the Application

Save the code as `main.py` and run the FastAPI application:

```plaintext
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You can now access the API endpoints using tools like `curl` or a REST client like Postman.

- **Create an order:** `POST /orders/`
- **Ship an order:** `POST /orders/{order_id}/ship`
- **Pay an order:** `POST /orders/{order_id}/pay`
- **Get an order:** `GET /orders/{order_id}`

### Explanation of the Code

- **Event Definitions:** `OrderCreated`, `OrderShipped`, and `PaymentReceived` classes define the events. Each event includes `data` which contains relevant information about the state change.
- **Order Aggregate:** The `Order` class represents the aggregate. The `apply` method handles applying events to the aggregate's state. `rebuild_order_from_events` reconstructs the current state of an order by replaying all its events.
- **Event Store:** The `InMemoryEventStore` class is a simple in-memory implementation of the `EventStore` interface. In a real application, you would use a persistent event store.
- **FastAPI Endpoints:** The FastAPI endpoints provide a REST API for creating, shipping, paying, and retrieving orders. Notice that each endpoint appends an event to the event store to signify the state change. When retrieving an order, the current state is reconstructed by replaying the events.
- **UUID:** We use `uuid` to generate unique order IDs.

## Moving Beyond In-Memory: Persistent Event Stores

The `InMemoryEventStore` is suitable for demonstration purposes but is not durable. To build a production-ready system, you need a persistent event store. Here are a few options:

- **PostgreSQL with `event-store`:** A popular choice is to use PostgreSQL along with a dedicated event store library like `event-store` (Python). This library provides features like event serialization, concurrency control, and subscriptions.
- **Kafka:** Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that can be used as an event store. It provides high throughput, scalability, and fault tolerance.
- **Dedicated Event Store Databases:** There are databases specifically designed for event sourcing, such as EventStoreDB.

### Integrating with PostgreSQL and `event-store`

Here's a brief example of how you might integrate with PostgreSQL and the `event-store` library (assuming you have PostgreSQL installed and configured):

1.  **Install `event-store`:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install event-store
    pip install psycopg2-binary  # Or equivalent PostgreSQL driver
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:** Create a database and tables required by `event-store` (refer to `event-store`'s documentation for details on database schema creation).

3.  **Code Integration:**

    ```plaintext
    from event_store import EventStore
    import psycopg2

    # ... (your FastAPI app) ...

    # Database connection details
    DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"  # Replace with your connection string

    # Initialize Event Store
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
        es = EventStore(session=conn)
    except psycopg2.Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to PostgreSQL: {e}")
        raise

    # Replace InMemoryEventStore with the EventStore instance
    event_store = es

    # Example of appending an event
    @app.post("/orders/")
    async def create_order(order_request: OrderCreateRequest):
        order_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        order_created_event = OrderCreated(data={
            "order_id": order_id,
            "customer_id": order_request.customer_id,
            "items": order_request.items
        })

        # Commit as a single atomic operation
        with event_store.session:  # Use the session context
            event_store.append(order_id, [order_created_event])
            event_store.session.commit()  # Commit the transaction

        return {"order_id": order_id, "message": "Order created successfully"}
    ```

    **Important:** Ensure proper error handling and transaction management when working with persistent databases. The example above uses a context manager to handle database transactions.

## Considerations for CQRS

Event Sourcing is often used in conjunction with CQRS. CQRS separates the read and write operations in an application.

- **Commands:** Operations that change the state of the system (e.g., creating an order, shipping an order). These operations append events to the Event Store.
- **Queries:** Operations that retrieve data from the system (e.g., getting an order). These operations read from optimized "read models" that are derived from the events in the Event Store.

To implement CQRS with Event Sourcing, you'll need to create a process that subscribes to the events in the Event Store and updates the read models accordingly. This can be done using message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) or directly within the event store library (if it supports subscriptions). The read models can be stored in a separate database optimized for querying (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).

## Benefits and Drawbacks of Event Sourcing

**Benefits:**

- **Complete Audit Trail:** Invaluable for compliance, debugging, and historical analysis.
- **Temporal Queries:** Ability to retrieve data as it existed at any point in time.
- **Improved Scalability and Performance:** CQRS allows for optimized read and write operations.
- **Microservices Integration:** Events facilitate communication and data synchronization between microservices.

**Drawbacks:**

- **Increased Complexity:** Event Sourcing adds complexity to the system's architecture and data management.
- **Eventual Consistency:** Read models may not be immediately consistent with the Event Store. This requires careful consideration when designing the application.
- **Eventual Consistency Management:** You need to consider how to handle eventual consistency issues, such as stale data in read models.
- **Event Versioning:** You need a strategy for handling changes to event schemas over time.
- **Learning Curve:** Developers need to understand the principles of Event Sourcing and CQRS.

## Conclusion

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that can provide significant benefits for certain applications. While it adds complexity, the advantages of a complete audit trail, temporal queries, and improved scalability often outweigh the costs. By using FastAPI and Python, you can effectively implement Event Sourcing and build robust, scalable, and auditable applications. Remember to choose a suitable event store and carefully consider the implications of eventual consistency. This guide provided a solid foundation for understanding and implementing Event Sourcing with FastAPI. Remember to explore further and adapt these principles to your specific use cases.
