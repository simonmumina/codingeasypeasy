# Mastering the `animationend` Event in HTML DOM: A Comprehensive Guide

CSS animations bring life to web pages, enhancing user experience and providing visual feedback. While defining animations is crucial, effectively handling animation completion is equally important. The `animationend` event in the HTML DOM provides a powerful mechanism to detect and respond to the end of a CSS animation. This guide will explore the `animationend` event in detail, providing practical examples and best practices to help you leverage it in your projects.

## What is the `animationend` Event?

The `animationend` event is a DOM event that fires when a CSS animation has finished playing on an element. It allows you to execute JavaScript code when the animation is complete, enabling you to perform actions such as:

- Triggering another animation
- Updating the DOM
- Sending data to a server
- Executing custom logic based on the completed animation

## Syntax

The syntax for attaching an `animationend` event listener is straightforward:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('animationend', function (event) {
  // Your code to execute when the animation ends
})
```

Where:

- `element` is a reference to the DOM element on which the animation is applied.
- `addEventListener()` is the standard method for attaching event listeners.
- `'animationend'` is the event type we're listening for.
- `function(event)` is the callback function that will be executed when the event occurs. The `event` object contains information about the animation that ended.

## The `AnimationEvent` Object

The callback function receives an `AnimationEvent` object as an argument. This object provides valuable information about the animation that triggered the event:

- **`animationName`:** A string representing the name of the CSS animation that completed.
- **`elapsedTime`:** A number indicating the number of seconds the animation ran for, excluding any time the animation was paused.
- **`target`:** A reference to the element on which the animation was running.
- **`type`:** A string indicating the event type, which will always be `"animationend"` in this case.
- **`pseudoElement`:** A string indicating the pseudo-element the animation runs on. An empty string ("") if the animation doesn't run on a pseudo-element.

## Basic Example: Fading Out an Element After Animation

Let's start with a simple example: fading out an element after a scaling animation.

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<div id="myElement" class="animated-element">This element will scale up and then fade out.</div>
```

**CSS:**

```plaintext
.animated-element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  animation: scaleUp 1s forwards; /* 'forwards' keeps the end state */
}

@keyframes scaleUp {
  from {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    transform: scale(1.5);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.fade-out {
  animation: fadeOut 1s forwards;
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const myElement = document.getElementById('myElement')

myElement.addEventListener('animationend', function (event) {
  if (event.animationName === 'scaleUp') {
    // Important: Check the animation name
    myElement.classList.add('fade-out') // Trigger the fadeOut animation
  }
})
```

In this example:

1.  We define an animation `scaleUp` that scales up the element. The `forwards` fill mode ensures the element stays scaled up at the end of the animation.
2.  When the `animationend` event fires, we check if the `animationName` is `scaleUp`. This is crucial because multiple animations might be applied to the same element.
3.  If the animation that ended was `scaleUp`, we add the `fade-out` class to the element, which triggers another animation, `fadeOut`, that fades out the element.

## Advanced Example: Creating a Sequence of Animations

The `animationend` event is particularly useful for creating complex animation sequences. Let's create a sequence where an element moves, changes color, and then rotates.

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<div id="myElement2" class="animated-element2">Click me to start the animation!</div>
```

**CSS:**

```plaintext
.animated-element2 {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  position: relative;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.move {
  animation: moveRight 1s forwards;
}

.change-color {
  animation: changeColor 1s forwards;
}

.rotate {
  animation: rotate360 1s forwards;
}

@keyframes moveRight {
  from {
    left: 0;
  }
  to {
    left: 200px;
  }
}

@keyframes changeColor {
  from {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
  to {
    background-color: lightcoral;
  }
}

@keyframes rotate360 {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const myElement2 = document.getElementById('myElement2')
let animationStage = 0

myElement2.addEventListener('click', function () {
  animationStage = 1 // Start the animation sequence

  // Add the move class to start the first animation
  myElement2.classList.add('move')
})

myElement2.addEventListener('animationend', function (event) {
  switch (animationStage) {
    case 1:
      if (event.animationName === 'moveRight') {
        myElement2.classList.remove('move') //Remove the class
        myElement2.classList.add('change-color')
        animationStage = 2
      }
      break
    case 2:
      if (event.animationName === 'changeColor') {
        myElement2.classList.remove('change-color')
        myElement2.classList.add('rotate')
        animationStage = 3
      }
      break
    case 3:
      if (event.animationName === 'rotate360') {
        // Animation sequence complete.  Optionally reset animationStage
        console.log('Animation Sequence Complete!')
      }
      break
  }
})
```

In this example:

1. We define three animations: `moveRight`, `changeColor`, and `rotate360`.
2. A click event triggers the `moveRight` animation.
3. The `animationend` listener checks the `animationStage` to determine which animation just ended. It also confirms the `animationName` matches the expected name.
4. Based on the ended animation, it removes the animation class and adds the next animation class, advancing the `animationStage`.
5. The sequence continues until all three animations have played.

This example demonstrates how to orchestrate a series of animations using the `animationend` event and managing state with `animationStage`. It uses the `remove()` and `add()` classList methods, which are best practices to manage the animation classes to trigger the event.

## Best Practices

- **Always Check `animationName`:** When handling the `animationend` event, always check the `animationName` property of the event object to ensure you're responding to the correct animation. This is especially important if multiple animations are applied to the same element.
- **Consider `animationiteration` Event:** If you need to perform actions after each iteration of an animation (e.g., for repeating animations), consider using the `animationiteration` event instead of `animationend`. This fires for each iteration _before_ the final iteration and `animationend` event.
- **Performance Considerations:** Avoid performing computationally expensive tasks within the `animationend` event handler, as this could impact performance. Defer such tasks if necessary.
- **Cleanup:** If you dynamically add and remove event listeners, remember to remove them when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. You can achieve this using `element.removeEventListener('animationend', yourFunction)`.
- **Use `forwards` for last animation state**: When sequencing animations, if you need to retain the final visual properties of an animation, ensure you set `animation-fill-mode` to `forwards` for that animation, or the values will return to their original states.

## Browser Compatibility

The `animationend` event is widely supported across modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. However, older browsers might not support it. You can use a polyfill or feature detection to ensure compatibility across different browsers. Libraries like Modernizr can assist with feature detection.

## Conclusion

The `animationend` event is a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web experiences. By understanding its functionality and best practices, you can effectively handle CSS animations, create complex animation sequences, and build engaging user interfaces. Remember to always check the `animationName` and manage your listeners efficiently for optimal performance. Happy animating!
