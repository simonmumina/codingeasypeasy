# Dapr and Flask: Building Microservices with Python and Distributed Application Runtime

In today's cloud-native world, microservices are becoming increasingly popular for building complex and scalable applications. However, building distributed systems presents significant challenges, including service discovery, reliable communication, state management, and handling failures. This is where **Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime)** comes in. Dapr is an open-source, portable, event-driven runtime that simplifies the building of resilient, microservice-based applications on any platform.

This blog post will guide you through integrating Dapr with Flask, a lightweight and popular Python web framework, to build robust and scalable microservices. We'll cover key Dapr building blocks and demonstrate their use with practical code examples.

## What is Dapr?

Dapr provides a set of distributed system building blocks exposed as HTTP and gRPC APIs. These building blocks handle common distributed system concerns, allowing you to focus on writing business logic rather than infrastructure code. Some key Dapr building blocks include:

- **Service Invocation:** Enables reliable and secure service-to-service communication.
- **State Management:** Provides a consistent and durable way to store and retrieve application state.
- **Pub/Sub:** Enables asynchronous communication between services through message brokers.
- **Bindings:** Connects your application to external resources like databases, queues, and file stores.
- **Actors:** Provides a virtual actor programming model for building stateful, concurrent, and distributed objects.
- **Concurrency:** Provides primitives for managing concurrent access to shared resources.
- **Resiliency:** Implements patterns such as retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts to handle failures gracefully.
- **Secrets:** Manages and secures application secrets.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6 or higher:** Make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH.
- **pip:** The Python package installer.
- **Docker:** Required for running Dapr sidecars.
- **Dapr CLI:** Install the Dapr CLI using the instructions on the [Dapr website](https://dapr.io/docs/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/).
- **Initialized Dapr Environment:** Initialize your Dapr environment by running `dapr init`.

## Setting up a Flask Application

Let's create a basic Flask application to demonstrate Dapr integration. Create a new directory for your project and create a file named `app.py`:

```plaintext
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

DAPR_HTTP_PORT = os.getenv("DAPR_HTTP_PORT", 3500)
DAPR_GRPC_PORT = os.getenv("DAPR_GRPC_PORT", 50001)


@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

Install Flask:

```plaintext
pip install Flask requests
```

This simple application defines a single route, `/`, which returns "Hello, World!". We've also defined environment variables `DAPR_HTTP_PORT` and `DAPR_GRPC_PORT` which Dapr uses to communicate with our application. Defaults are provided in case the environment variables are not set.

## Integrating Dapr: Service Invocation

Let's demonstrate service invocation. We'll create two Flask applications: a "caller" service and a "callee" service. The caller service will invoke the callee service through Dapr.

### Callee Service (callee.py)

```plaintext
# callee.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET'])
def hello():
    return jsonify({"message": "Hello from the Callee Service!"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```

This service listens on port 5001 and provides a `/hello` endpoint that returns a JSON response.

### Caller Service (caller.py)

```plaintext
# caller.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

DAPR_HTTP_PORT = os.getenv("DAPR_HTTP_PORT", 3500)
DAPR_APP_ID = "callee"  # Dapr app-id of the callee service

@app.route('/call-hello', methods=['GET'])
def call_hello():
    url = f'http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}/v1.0/invoke/{DAPR_APP_ID}/method/hello'
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        return jsonify(response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

The caller service listens on port 5000 and provides a `/call-hello` endpoint. This endpoint invokes the `/hello` endpoint of the callee service through Dapr. Notice how we're using the `DAPR_HTTP_PORT` environment variable and the Dapr `app-id` of the callee service. We use `response.raise_for_status()` to properly handle HTTP errors from the callee service.

### Running the Services with Dapr

1.  **Run the Callee Service:**

    ```plaintext
    dapr run --app-id callee --app-port 5001 -- python callee.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Caller Service:**

    ```plaintext
    dapr run --app-id caller --app-port 5000 -- python caller.py
    ```

    - `--app-id`: A unique identifier for the Dapr application. This is crucial for service discovery and invocation.
    - `--app-port`: The port on which the Flask application is listening.

3.  **Test the Service Invocation:**

    Open your browser or use `curl` to access the `/call-hello` endpoint of the caller service:

    ```plaintext
    curl http://localhost:5000/call-hello
    ```

    You should see the following output:

    ```json
    { "message": "Hello from the Callee Service!" }
    ```

This demonstrates how Dapr simplifies service invocation by handling service discovery and providing a consistent API for communication. You don't need to worry about the exact location of the callee service; Dapr takes care of routing the request.

## Integrating Dapr: State Management

Dapr provides a simple and consistent API for managing application state. Let's see how to use it with Flask.

```plaintext
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

DAPR_HTTP_PORT = os.getenv("DAPR_HTTP_PORT", 3500)
STATE_STORE_NAME = "statestore"  # Replace with your Dapr state store name

@app.route('/state/<key>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def state(key):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        data = request.get_json()
        url = f'http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}/v1.0/state/{STATE_STORE_NAME}/{key}'
        response = requests.post(url, json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return jsonify({"message": "State saved successfully"})
    elif request.method == 'GET':
        url = f'http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}/v1.0/state/{STATE_STORE_NAME}/{key}'
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return jsonify(response.json())
        elif response.status_code == 204:
            return jsonify({"message": "State not found"}), 404
        else:
            response.raise_for_status()
    return jsonify({"error": "Invalid method"}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
```

This code defines a `/state/<key>` endpoint that allows you to store and retrieve state using Dapr's state management building block. `STATE_STORE_NAME` refers to the name of the Dapr component configured for state management. We use `requests` to interact with the Dapr state API. We handle the case where the requested state is not found by checking for a 204 status code and returning a 404 error.

### Configuring a State Store Component

Dapr uses components to abstract away the underlying infrastructure. You need to configure a state store component (e.g., Redis, Azure Cosmos DB) to use state management. Create a file named `statestore.yaml` in a `components` directory:

```yaml
# components/statestore.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: localhost:6379
    - name: redisPassword
      value: ''
    - name: actorStateStore
      value: 'true' # Enable actor state storage
```

This example configures a Redis state store running on localhost. Remember to replace the `redisHost` and `redisPassword` with your actual Redis configuration. The `actorStateStore: "true"` configuration is important for Actor based applications.

### Running the Application with State Management

1.  **Start Redis (if you don't already have it running):**

    ```plaintext
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
    ```

2.  **Run the Flask application with Dapr:**

    ```plaintext
    dapr run --app-id state-app --app-port 5000 --components-path ./components -- python app.py
    ```

    - `--components-path`: Specifies the directory containing the Dapr component configuration files.

3.  **Test State Management:**

    - **Save state:**

      ```plaintext
      curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": "MyData"}' http://localhost:5000/state/mykey
      ```

    - **Retrieve state:**

      ```plaintext
      curl http://localhost:5000/state/mykey
      ```

      You should see the following output:

      ```json
      { "value": "MyData" }
      ```

## Integrating Dapr: Pub/Sub

Dapr simplifies asynchronous communication using the Pub/Sub building block. Let's create a publisher and a subscriber using Flask.

### Subscriber Service (subscriber.py)

```plaintext
# subscriber.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/dapr/subscribe', methods=['GET'])
def subscribe():
    subscriptions = [
        {
            "topic": "my-topic",
            "route": "/topic-handler"
        }
    ]
    return jsonify(subscriptions)


@app.route('/topic-handler', methods=['POST'])
def topic_handler():
    data = request.get_json()
    print(f"Received message on topic 'my-topic': {data}")
    return jsonify({"status": "SUCCESS"})


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```

This service defines two endpoints:

- `/dapr/subscribe`: This endpoint is required by Dapr. It returns a JSON array describing the topics the application wants to subscribe to and the corresponding routes to handle messages.
- `/topic-handler`: This endpoint handles messages received on the `my-topic` topic.

### Publisher Service (publisher.py)

```plaintext
# publisher.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import os
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

DAPR_HTTP_PORT = os.getenv("DAPR_HTTP_PORT", 3500)
PUBSUB_NAME = "pubsub"  # Replace with your Dapr Pub/Sub component name
TOPIC_NAME = "my-topic"


@app.route('/publish', methods=['POST'])
def publish():
    data = request.get_json()
    url = f'http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}/v1.0/publish/{PUBSUB_NAME}/{TOPIC_NAME}'
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return jsonify({"message": "Message published successfully"})


if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True, port=5000)

```

This service defines a `/publish` endpoint that publishes a message to the `my-topic` topic using Dapr's Pub/Sub API. `PUBSUB_NAME` refers to the name of the Dapr component configured for Pub/Sub.

### Configuring a Pub/Sub Component

Create a file named `pubsub.yaml` in the `components` directory:

```yaml
# components/pubsub.yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: pubsub
spec:
  type: pubsub.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
    - name: redisHost
      value: localhost:6379
    - name: redisPassword
      value: ''
```

This example configures a Redis Pub/Sub component.

### Running the Services with Pub/Sub

1.  **Start Redis (if you don't already have it running):**

    ```plaintext
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
    ```

2.  **Run the Subscriber Service:**

    ```plaintext
    dapr run --app-id subscriber --app-port 5001 --components-path ./components -- python subscriber.py
    ```

3.  **Run the Publisher Service:**

    ```plaintext
    dapr run --app-id publisher --app-port 5000 --components-path ./components -- python publisher.py
    ```

4.  **Test Pub/Sub:**

    Send a POST request to the `/publish` endpoint of the publisher service:

    ```plaintext
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello from Publisher"}' http://localhost:5000/publish
    ```

    You should see the following output in the subscriber service's console:

    ```
    Received message on topic 'my-topic': {'message': 'Hello from Publisher'}
    ```

## Integrating Dapr: Actors (Optional, More Advanced)

Dapr Actors provide a virtual actor programming model that simplifies building concurrent, distributed, and stateful objects.

### Defining an Actor (my_actor.py - separate file)

```plaintext
# my_actor.py
from dapr.actor import Actor, ActorRuntime, ActorId
from dapr.actor.runtime.context import ActorRuntimeContext
import asyncio

class MyActor(Actor):
    def __init__(self, actor_id: ActorId, ctx: ActorRuntimeContext):
        super().__init__(actor_id, ctx)
        self._count = 0

    async def on_activate(self) -> None:
        """Actor activated, initialize state prior to method calls."""
        print(f"Activating actor id: {self.id}")
        # Load initial state
        state = await self.get_state("my_state")
        if "count" in state:
            self._count = state["count"]

    async def on_deactivate(self) -> None:
        """Actor deactivated, save state."""
        print(f"Deactivating actor id: {self.id}")
        # Save state
        await self.save_state({"count": self._count})

    async def get_count(self) -> int:
        """Get current count."""
        print(f"Getting count for actor id: {self.id}")
        return self._count

    async def increment_count(self, delta: int) -> int:
        """Increment count."""
        print(f"Incrementing count for actor id: {self.id} by {delta}")
        self._count += delta
        return self._count


async def main():
    actor_type = "MyActor"
    ActorRuntime.set_actor_type_config(
        actor_type,
        ActorRuntimeContext(actor_type, MyActor, actor_reentrancy_config_enabled=False)
    )
    await ActorRuntime.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This defines a simple actor called `MyActor` with methods to get and increment a counter. It also demonstrates `on_activate` and `on_deactivate` methods for initializing and saving state, respectively. Remember to install `dapr-ext-actor`:

```plaintext
pip install dapr-ext-actor
```

### Flask Application (app.py)

```plaintext
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests
import os
import uuid
import asyncio
from dapr.actor import ActorProxy, ActorId
from dapr.actor.runtime.actor_runtime import ActorRuntime

app = Flask(__name__)

DAPR_HTTP_PORT = os.getenv("DAPR_HTTP_PORT", 3500)
ACTOR_TYPE = "MyActor"

@app.route('/actor/increment', methods=['POST'])
async def actor_increment():
    actor_id = request.args.get('actor_id') or str(uuid.uuid4())
    delta = request.json.get('delta', 1)

    actor = ActorProxy.create(actor_type=ACTOR_TYPE, actor_id=actor_id, host=f'http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}')
    result = await actor.proxy.increment_count(delta=delta)
    return jsonify({"actor_id": actor_id, "new_count": result})


@app.route('/actor/get', methods=['GET'])
async def actor_get():
    actor_id = request.args.get('actor_id') or str(uuid.uuid4())
    actor = ActorProxy.create(actor_type=ACTOR_TYPE, actor_id=actor_id, host=f'http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}')
    result = await actor.proxy.get_count()
    return jsonify({"actor_id": actor_id, "count": result})


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(ActorRuntime.start())  # Start the Dapr Actor Runtime within the Flask app
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000) # Changed to debug=True to help with seeing errors

```

This Flask application provides endpoints to interact with the `MyActor`. It uses `ActorProxy` to interact with the actor through Dapr. We generate a unique `actor_id` if one is not provided in the request. Importantly, we are now using `asyncio.run` to start the ActorRuntime within the Flask application.

### Running the Actor Service

```plaintext
dapr run --app-id actor-app --app-port 5000 --components-path ./components -- python app.py -- python my_actor.py
```

**Important Considerations for Actors:**

- **Concurrency:** The `ActorRuntimeContext` configuration includes `actor_reentrancy_config_enabled=False`. Reentrancy allows actors to call themselves, but can lead to complex debugging. For this simple example, we've disabled it. Review the Dapr documentation on actor reentrancy for more details.
- **State Storage:** The `statestore.yaml` should include `actorStateStore: "true"` as mentioned earlier, to enable actor state storage.
- **Actor Type Registration:** The `ActorRuntime.set_actor_type_config` call registers the `MyActor` with the Dapr runtime.
- **Placement:** Dapr uses a placement service to distribute actors across the cluster. If you are running locally, Dapr will automatically handle placement. In a production environment, you might need to configure the placement service.

### Testing the Actor Endpoints

- **Increment Actor Count:**

  ```plaintext
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"delta": 5}' http://localhost:5000/actor/increment?actor_id=myactor
  ```

- **Get Actor Count:**

  ```plaintext
  curl http://localhost:5000/actor/get?actor_id=myactor
  ```

  This will retrieve the current count for the actor with ID "myactor". The first time it is called, state will be initialized to 0 based on code.

## Conclusion

This blog post has demonstrated how to integrate Dapr with Flask to build microservices using key Dapr building blocks like service invocation, state management, and Pub/Sub. Dapr simplifies the complexities of distributed systems, allowing you to focus on writing business logic. The Actors building block provides a powerful model for building stateful, concurrent applications. Remember to configure Dapr components appropriately for your environment and explore the rich set of features that Dapr offers to build robust and scalable microservices. You can explore Dapr bindings to integrate with external services, and explore concurrency and resiliency features for handling failures.
