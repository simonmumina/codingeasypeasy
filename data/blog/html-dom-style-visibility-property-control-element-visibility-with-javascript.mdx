# HTML DOM Style visibility Property: Control Element Visibility with JavaScript

In modern web development, dynamically controlling the visibility of elements is a fundamental requirement. The HTML DOM Style `visibility` property provides a powerful mechanism to achieve this using JavaScript. This blog post delves deep into the `visibility` property, exploring its syntax, possible values, practical applications, and best practices.

## What is the HTML DOM Style `visibility` Property?

The `visibility` property, accessed through the HTML DOM (Document Object Model), allows you to programmatically control whether an element is visible or hidden on a web page. It directly manipulates the CSS `visibility` property of the selected element. The key difference between using `visibility` and `display` is that with `visibility: hidden`, the element still occupies space in the layout, while `display: none` removes the element entirely from the rendering process.

## Syntax

The syntax for accessing and modifying the `visibility` property using JavaScript is straightforward:

```plaintext
element.style.visibility = 'value'
```

Where:

- `element`: A reference to the HTML element you want to modify (obtained using methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, etc.).
- `style`: The style object associated with the element.
- `visibility`: The `visibility` property within the style object.
- `value`: One of the valid values for the `visibility` property (described below).

## Possible Values for `visibility`

The `visibility` property accepts several values, each impacting the element's display differently:

- **`visible`**: The default value. The element is visible on the page.

- **`hidden`**: The element is hidden, but it still takes up space in the document layout. This is a crucial distinction from `display: none`.

- **`collapse`**: This value primarily applies to table rows, table columns, and column groups. When applied, the element (row/column) collapses and takes up no space. This is particularly useful for dynamically hiding rows or columns in a table without disrupting the overall table structure. It's important to note that `collapse` may not be consistently supported across all browsers for non-table elements, so exercise caution.

- **`inherit`**: The element inherits the `visibility` property from its parent element.

- **`initial`**: Sets the property to its default value (`visible`).

- **`unset`**: Removes the value that was assigned to the property (i.e. the property is not set at all).

## Practical Examples with Code

Let's illustrate the usage of the `visibility` property with several practical examples:

### 1. Showing and Hiding an Element with Buttons

This example demonstrates toggling the visibility of an element using two buttons.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Visibility Example</title>
<style>
  #myDiv {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    margin-top: 20px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<button onclick="showDiv()">Show Div</button>
<button onclick="hideDiv()">Hide Div</button>

<div id="myDiv">This is a div element.</div>

<script>
function showDiv() {
  document.getElementById("myDiv").style.visibility = "visible";
}

function hideDiv() {
  document.getElementById("myDiv").style.visibility = "hidden";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- We have two buttons, "Show Div" and "Hide Div," that trigger the `showDiv()` and `hideDiv()` JavaScript functions, respectively.
- The `showDiv()` function sets the `visibility` property of the `myDiv` element to `"visible"`, making it appear on the page.
- The `hideDiv()` function sets the `visibility` property of the `myDiv` element to `"hidden"`, hiding it while preserving its allocated space.

### 2. Using `visibility: collapse` for Table Rows

This example shows how to dynamically collapse a table row.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Collapse Example</title>
<style>
  table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
  }
  th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 8px;
    text-align: left;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<button onclick="collapseRow()">Collapse Row 2</button>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header 1</th>
      <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
      <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr id="row2">
      <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
      <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 3, Column 1</td>
      <td>Row 3, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<script>
function collapseRow() {
  document.getElementById("row2").style.visibility = "collapse";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- Clicking the "Collapse Row 2" button executes the `collapseRow()` function.
- This function sets the `visibility` property of the table row with the ID `row2` to `"collapse"`.
- The result is that Row 2 disappears from the table, and the table structure adjusts to fill the gap.

### 3. Using `visibility: inherit`

This example demonstrates how child elements inherit their `visibility` property from their parent.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Inherit Example</title>
<style>
  #parentDiv {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<button onclick="toggleParentVisibility()">Toggle Parent Visibility</button>

<div id="parentDiv">
  <p>This is a paragraph inside the parent div.</p>
  <span id="childSpan" style="visibility: inherit;">This is a span with inherit visibility.</span>
</div>

<script>
function toggleParentVisibility() {
  const parentDiv = document.getElementById("parentDiv");
  parentDiv.style.visibility = (parentDiv.style.visibility === "hidden") ? "visible" : "hidden";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- The `childSpan` element's `visibility` is set to `inherit`.
- The `toggleParentVisibility` function toggles the `visibility` of the `parentDiv`. Because the `childSpan` inherits its visibility from its parent, its visibility also changes along with the parent.

## Key Differences: `visibility: hidden` vs. `display: none`

It's crucial to understand the difference between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none`:

| Feature            | `visibility: hidden`                    | `display: none`                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Space Occupied     | Element still occupies space in layout  | Element takes up no space in layout                                           |
| Reflow             | No reflow occurs                        | Reflow occurs; layout is recalculated                                         |
| Accessibility      | Screen readers may announce the element | Screen readers will not announce element                                      |
| Performance Impact | Generally less performance impact       | Can have more significant performance impact, especially with complex layouts |

Choose `visibility: hidden` when you want to hide an element while preserving its space on the page (e.g., for animations or transitions). Use `display: none` when you want to completely remove an element from the layout.

## Best Practices

- **Use CSS classes for styling:** Instead of directly manipulating the `style` property in JavaScript, consider adding or removing CSS classes that define the visibility. This promotes separation of concerns and makes your code more maintainable.

  ```plaintext
  element.classList.add('hidden') // Assuming .hidden { visibility: hidden; } in CSS
  element.classList.remove('hidden')
  ```

- **Consider accessibility:** If you're hiding content for visual purposes, ensure it doesn't negatively impact accessibility. Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-hidden="true"`) to inform assistive technologies about the hidden content. However, if you're using `display: none`, screen readers will not announce the content, so `aria-hidden` is unnecessary.

- **Performance:** Excessive DOM manipulation can impact performance. Try to minimize direct style changes and consider techniques like debouncing or throttling to optimize updates, especially in scenarios involving frequent visibility toggles.

- **Use `display:none` with caution:** While `display:none` effectively removes an element, it can lead to unexpected layout shifts if not handled carefully. Consider using `visibility:hidden` when preserving layout integrity is important.

- **Consider Transitions:** Combine the `visibility` property with CSS transitions for smooth and engaging visual effects when showing or hiding elements. For example, you can gradually fade an element in or out by transitioning the `opacity` property in conjunction with `visibility`.

## Conclusion

The HTML DOM Style `visibility` property is a valuable tool for dynamically controlling the visibility of elements on your web pages. By understanding its syntax, possible values, and the distinction between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none`, you can effectively create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. Remember to prioritize accessibility and performance while implementing dynamic visibility changes in your web applications.
