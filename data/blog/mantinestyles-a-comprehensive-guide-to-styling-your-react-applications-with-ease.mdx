# @mantine/styles: A Comprehensive Guide to Styling Your React Applications with Ease

Styling React applications can often become a complex and challenging task. Managing CSS files, handling responsiveness, and ensuring consistency across your application can quickly lead to a maintenance nightmare. Fortunately, libraries like Mantine offer powerful solutions to streamline the styling process. This article delves into `@mantine/styles`, the core styling engine behind Mantine UI, and demonstrates how to leverage its features to build beautiful, consistent, and maintainable React applications.

## What is `@mantine/styles`?

`@mantine/styles` is a CSS-in-JS library that provides a flexible and intuitive way to style your React components. It's not just about adding CSS; it's about creating a design system that you can easily reuse and maintain throughout your application. It offers features such as:

- **Theming:** Define a central theme and apply it consistently across your components.
- **Breakpoints:** Easily manage responsive design with pre-defined or custom breakpoints.
- **Media Queries:** Create responsive styles with a simple and elegant syntax.
- **Global Styles:** Inject global CSS rules into your application.
- **`createStyles` Hook:** Generate dynamic styles based on props and theme.
- **`useMantineTheme` Hook:** Access the current theme within your components.
- **RTL Support:** Built-in support for right-to-left languages.

## Getting Started with `@mantine/styles`

First, you need to install the `@mantine/core` package, which includes `@mantine/styles` as a dependency:

```plaintext
npm install @mantine/core @emotion/react @emotion/server
# or
yarn add @mantine/core @emotion/react @emotion/server
# or
pnpm add @mantine/core @emotion/react @emotion/server
```

**Note:** `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/server` are peer dependencies and must be installed separately. Mantine utilizes Emotion as its CSS-in-JS engine.

### Setting up the `MantineProvider`

To utilize the theme features of `@mantine/styles`, you need to wrap your application with the `MantineProvider`. This provider makes the theme available to all your components.

```jsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core'

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={{ colorScheme: 'light' }}>
      {/* Your application content */}
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

- `withGlobalStyles`: Injects Mantine's default global styles (e.g., box-sizing reset, font family).
- `withNormalizeCSS`: Injects a normalize.css reset for cross-browser consistency.
- `theme`: The Mantine theme object, allowing you to customize colors, fonts, breakpoints, and more. In this example, we set the `colorScheme` to `'light'`.

## Theming with `@mantine/styles`

Theming is a central concept in `@mantine/styles`. It allows you to define a set of design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) and apply them consistently throughout your application.

### Default Theme

Mantine provides a default theme that you can customize. Here's an example:

```javascript
const theme = {
  fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif',
  primaryColor: 'blue',
  colors: {
    'custom-color': [
      '#f0f0f0',
      '#e0e0e0',
      '#d0d0d0',
      '#c0c0c0',
      '#b0b0b0',
      '#a0a0a0',
      '#909090',
      '#808080',
      '#707070',
      '#606060',
    ],
  },
  breakpoints: {
    xs: 480,
    sm: 768,
    md: 992,
    lg: 1200,
    xl: 1440,
  },
}
```

- `fontFamily`: Specifies the default font family for the application.
- `primaryColor`: Sets the primary color, used for primary buttons, links, etc. Mantine uses 10 shades for each color, accessible via the `theme.colors` object.
- `colors`: Allows you to define custom colors. Each color should be an array of 10 shades.
- `breakpoints`: Defines the breakpoints used for responsive design.

### Applying the Theme

You can apply the theme by passing it to the `MantineProvider`:

```jsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core'

const theme = {
  fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif',
  primaryColor: 'blue',
}

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={theme}>
      {/* Your application content */}
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Using the Theme in Components

You can access the theme within your components using the `useMantineTheme` hook.

```jsx
import { useMantineTheme, Text } from '@mantine/core'

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useMantineTheme()

  return (
    <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.blue[6], fontFamily: theme.fontFamily }}>
      This text uses the theme's blue color and font family.
    </Text>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

## Styling with `createStyles`

The `createStyles` hook is a powerful tool for generating dynamic styles based on props and the theme.

```jsx
import { createStyles, Text, Button } from '@mantine/core'

const useStyles = createStyles((theme, params) => ({
  wrapper: {
    backgroundColor: theme.colors[params.backgroundColor || theme.primaryColor][0],
    padding: theme.spacing.md,
    borderRadius: theme.radius.md,
  },

  title: {
    color: theme.colors.dark[9],
    fontSize: theme.fontSizes.lg,
    fontWeight: 500,
  },

  button: {
    marginTop: theme.spacing.md,
  },
}))

function MyStyledComponent({ backgroundColor }) {
  const { classes } = useStyles({ backgroundColor })

  return (
    <div className={classes.wrapper}>
      <Text className={classes.title}>Styled Component</Text>
      <Button className={classes.button}>Click Me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyStyledComponent
```

- `createStyles` takes a function that receives the `theme` and any `params` you pass to the hook.
- It returns an object with a `classes` property, which contains the generated CSS class names.
- You can then apply these class names to your components using the `className` prop.

## Responsive Design with Breakpoints and Media Queries

`@mantine/styles` makes it easy to implement responsive design using breakpoints and media queries.

### Using Breakpoints

The `theme.breakpoints` object defines the screen sizes at which your styles should change.

```javascript
const theme = {
  breakpoints: {
    xs: 480,
    sm: 768,
    md: 992,
    lg: 1200,
    xl: 1440,
  },
}
```

### Using Media Queries in `createStyles`

You can use the `theme.fn.smallerThan` and `theme.fn.largerThan` functions within `createStyles` to create media queries.

```jsx
import { createStyles, Text } from '@mantine/core'

const useStyles = createStyles((theme) => ({
  title: {
    fontSize: theme.fontSizes.lg,
    fontWeight: 500,

    [theme.fn.smallerThan('sm')]: {
      fontSize: theme.fontSizes.md,
    },
  },
}))

function ResponsiveText() {
  const { classes } = useStyles()

  return <Text className={classes.title}>Responsive Text</Text>
}

export default ResponsiveText
```

In this example, the `title` class will have a `fontSize` of `theme.fontSizes.lg` by default. However, when the screen width is smaller than the `sm` breakpoint (768px), the `fontSize` will be changed to `theme.fontSizes.md`.

### Using Media Queries with `theme.fn.largerThan`

Similarly, `theme.fn.largerThan` allows you to apply styles when the screen size is larger than a specified breakpoint.

```jsx
import { createStyles, Text } from '@mantine/core'

const useStyles = createStyles((theme) => ({
  title: {
    fontSize: theme.fontSizes.md,
    fontWeight: 500,

    [theme.fn.largerThan('md')]: {
      fontSize: theme.fontSizes.lg,
    },
  },
}))

function ResponsiveText() {
  const { classes } = useStyles()

  return <Text className={classes.title}>Responsive Text</Text>
}

export default ResponsiveText
```

In this example, the `title` class will have a `fontSize` of `theme.fontSizes.md` by default. However, when the screen width is larger than the `md` breakpoint (992px), the `fontSize` will be changed to `theme.fontSizes.lg`.

## Global Styles

`@mantine/styles` allows you to inject global CSS rules into your application using the `Global` component.

```jsx
import { Global } from '@mantine/core'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Global
        styles={(theme) => ({
          body: {
            backgroundColor: theme.colors.gray[0],
            color: theme.colors.dark[9],
          },
        })}
      />
      {/* Your application content */}
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

The `Global` component takes a `styles` prop, which is a function that receives the theme and returns an object containing the CSS rules to be applied globally.

## RTL Support

`@mantine/styles` has built-in support for right-to-left languages. To enable RTL support, you need to set the `dir` attribute on the `html` element to `'rtl'`.

```jsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core'

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={{ colorScheme: 'light' }} dir="rtl">
      {/* Your application content */}
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

Mantine automatically flips the layout of components and applies the correct direction to text.

## Conclusion

`@mantine/styles` provides a powerful and flexible way to style your React applications. Its theming capabilities, responsive design features, and global style support make it a valuable tool for building consistent and maintainable user interfaces. By leveraging the `createStyles` hook, you can create dynamic styles that adapt to your application's theme and user interactions. By using these features effectively, you can drastically improve your development workflow and create truly amazing user experiences. Consider exploring the Mantine documentation for even more advanced usage and customization options.
