# Yarn vs. npm login: Securely Publish Your JavaScript Packages to npm

Publishing your JavaScript packages to the npm registry is a crucial step in sharing your work with the wider development community. However, before you can publish, you need to be properly authenticated. This guide explores the different ways to securely log in to npm using both Yarn and npm, the two most popular JavaScript package managers. We'll cover best practices for security, troubleshooting common problems, and help you choose the right approach for your workflow.

## Why is `npm login` important?

The `npm login` (or `yarn login`) command is your gateway to interacting with the npm registry, the central repository for JavaScript packages.  Without being logged in, you cannot:

*   **Publish new packages:**  This is the core reason for logging in. You need to be authenticated to claim your package name and upload your code.
*   **Update existing packages:**  You must be authenticated to make changes or publish new versions of packages you already own.
*   **Manage your npm profile:** Modify your email, username, or other profile information.
*   **Use scoped packages in private mode (with a paid npm account):**  Private scoped packages require authentication for access and publishing.

Therefore, securing your login process is essential for protecting your packages and your account.

## `npm login`: The Traditional Approach

The standard `npm login` command, when executed without any arguments, will prompt you for your username, password, and email address. This method, while functional, is **strongly discouraged** due to security concerns, especially on CI/CD environments.  Storing passwords directly is generally a bad practice.

**Example (Discouraged):**

```bash
npm login
Username: your_npm_username
Password: your_npm_password
Email: your_email@example.com
Logged in as your_npm_username on https://registry.npmjs.org/.
```

**Why is this approach discouraged?**

*   **Password exposure:** Storing passwords, even temporarily, increases the risk of exposure, especially in shared environments.
*   **Automation difficulties:**  Entering passwords manually doesn't lend itself well to automated workflows like CI/CD pipelines.

## `npm login` with Tokens: The Recommended Approach

The preferred method for authenticating with npm is using **tokens**. Tokens provide a much more secure and flexible alternative to password-based login.

**Generating an npm Token:**

1.  **Log in to the npm website:** Go to [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/) and log in to your account.
2.  **Access your access tokens:** Click on your profile picture, then select "Access Tokens."
3.  **Generate a new token:** Click "Generate New Token."
4.  **Choose a Token Type:**  Select the appropriate token type based on its intended use:
    *   **Read:** Only allows reading package information.
    *   **Write:**  Allows publishing new packages and updating existing ones.
    *   **CI:** Designed for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment environments; less powerful than 'Write' but suitable for automated publishing.
5.  **Name your token:** Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "CI Server Token").
6.  **Copy the token:**  **Carefully copy the generated token**.  This is the *only* time you will see the token. Store it securely!

**Using the token with `npm login`:**

```bash
npm login --scope=@your_npm_username --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ --auth-type=legacy
```

This command will then prompt for the token.  Paste the token into the password field.  The `username` and `email` fields can be anything valid.

**More Securely with Environment Variables (Recommended for CI/CD):**

A much better practice is to store the token as an environment variable and use that in your CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
NPM_TOKEN=YOUR_NPM_TOKEN_HERE
npm config set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken "${NPM_TOKEN}"
```

In your CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI), set the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your token.  Then, in your build script, use the above command *before* running `npm publish`.

**Why tokens are superior:**

*   **Granular Permissions:**  Tokens can be scoped to specific actions (read-only, publish-only, etc.), reducing the potential damage if a token is compromised.
*   **Revocability:**  You can easily revoke a token if you suspect it has been compromised, without changing your npm password.
*   **Automation-Friendly:** Tokens are easily stored as environment variables and used in automated scripts.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Tokens are inherently more secure than storing passwords directly.

## Yarn Login: Two Primary Methods

Yarn, like npm, offers a way to authenticate with the npm registry.  Prior to Yarn 2, the experience was closer to the older `npm login` experience.  Now, it largely aligns with token-based authentication.

**1. Yarn 1.x: The Password-Based Approach (Not Recommended)**

Yarn 1.x uses the `yarn login` command, which prompts for your username, password, and email, similar to the traditional `npm login`.  This method suffers from the same security drawbacks as the traditional `npm login`.

**Example (Yarn 1.x - Discouraged):**

```bash
yarn login
yarn login v1.22.19
info npm username: your_npm_username
info npm password: your_npm_password
info npm email: your_email@example.com
success Logged in.
Done in 15.17s.
```

**2. Yarn 2+ (Berry): Token-Based Authentication (Recommended)**

Yarn 2+ (often referred to as Berry) uses a different approach. You configure Yarn to use your npm token directly.  This is the recommended and more secure way to authenticate with npm using Yarn.

**Steps for Yarn 2+ Token-Based Authentication:**

1.  **Generate an npm token:**  Follow the same steps outlined above for generating an npm token in the `npm login` section.

2.  **Set the npm registry authentication token:**  Use the following command, replacing `YOUR_NPM_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token:

    ```bash
    yarn config set npmAuthToken YOUR_NPM_TOKEN_HERE -g
    ```
    `-g` flag updates the global configuration. If you want to set the token for a specific project only, remove `-g` and run the command inside the project directory.

3.  **(Optional) Set the npm registry URL (if necessary):**  In most cases, Yarn will automatically detect the npm registry. However, if you need to explicitly specify it, use:

    ```bash
    yarn config set npmRegistryServer "https://registry.npmjs.org" -g
    ```

4.  **(Optional) Set the npm email address (if necessary):**  While not strictly required, you can optionally set your npm email address:

    ```bash
    yarn config set npmPublishConfig.email "your_email@example.com" -g
    ```

**Example using Environment Variable (Yarn 2+):**

This is the preferred way to set the token in CI/CD environments.

```bash
NPM_TOKEN=YOUR_NPM_TOKEN_HERE
yarn config set npmAuthToken "$NPM_TOKEN" -g
```

**Verifying Your Yarn Configuration:**

You can verify your Yarn configuration using the following command:

```bash
yarn config get npmAuthToken
```

This should output your npm token.  If it's not visible, you've likely made a mistake in setting the configuration.

**Advantages of Yarn 2+ Token-Based Authentication:**

*   **Security:** Avoids storing passwords directly.
*   **Automation:**  Seamlessly integrates with CI/CD pipelines using environment variables.
*   **Consistency:**  Aligns with modern security best practices.

## Publishing Your Package After Logging In

Once you've successfully logged in using either npm or Yarn, you can publish your package using the `npm publish` or `yarn publish` command from within your package directory.

**Example (npm):**

```bash
npm publish
```

**Example (Yarn):**

```bash
yarn publish
```

Ensure you have properly prepared your package for publishing by:

*   Setting the `name` and `version` fields in your `package.json` file.
*   Defining a `description`, `keywords`, and `license`.
*   Configuring a `.npmignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being published.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **"You must be logged in to publish":** This error indicates that you haven't successfully logged in. Double-check your npm token or credentials and try again.
*   **"Invalid authentication token":**  This means your token is either incorrect, expired, or doesn't have the necessary permissions.  Regenerate a new token and try again.
*   **"E403 Forbidden":**  This error typically occurs when you're trying to publish a package with a name that already exists or when your token doesn't have the necessary permissions. Ensure your package name is unique, and your token has "write" or "CI" access.
*   **"Unexpected end of JSON input":**  This can happen if there's a problem with your `.npmrc` file. Try deleting the file and re-logging in.
*   **Yarn "401 Unauthorized":**  This usually means Yarn cannot find the `npmAuthToken` or the token is invalid. Double-check your yarn config using `yarn config get npmAuthToken`.

## Security Best Practices for npm Login

*   **Always use token-based authentication:** Avoid password-based login whenever possible.
*   **Store tokens securely:**  Never commit tokens to your repository. Use environment variables and secrets management tools in CI/CD.
*   **Use CI tokens for automated publishing:** CI tokens have limited permissions and are safer for automated environments.
*   **Revoke unused tokens:**  Regularly review your access tokens and revoke any that are no longer needed.
*   **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):**  Add an extra layer of security to your npm account.
*   **Be cautious of phishing attempts:**  Double-check the URLs and sender addresses of any emails or websites asking for your npm credentials.
*   **Monitor your npm account activity:**  Regularly review your account logs for any suspicious activity.

## Conclusion

Securing your npm login process is essential for protecting your packages and your account.  By understanding the different authentication methods available in npm and Yarn, and by following the security best practices outlined in this guide, you can ensure a smooth and secure package publishing experience.  Choose token-based authentication whenever possible, store tokens securely, and regularly review your account activity to maintain the integrity of your JavaScript ecosystem.
