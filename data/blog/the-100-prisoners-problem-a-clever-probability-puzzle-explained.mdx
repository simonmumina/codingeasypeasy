# The 100 Prisoners Problem: A Clever Probability Puzzle Explained

The 100 prisoners problem is a captivating probability puzzle that demonstrates how a seemingly insignificant piece of information can dramatically improve your odds of success. At first glance, the chances of success seem incredibly slim, but a clever strategy allows the prisoners to significantly beat the odds. Let's dive in!

## The Puzzle Setup

Imagine 100 prisoners, each assigned a unique number from 1 to 100.  There's a room containing 100 drawers, each also labeled with a unique number from 1 to 100. Inside each drawer is a randomly placed slip of paper with one of the prisoner numbers on it.

The prisoners enter the room one at a time. Each prisoner can open up to 50 drawers to look for their own number. After looking in the drawers, they must leave the room exactly as they found it (they cannot move slips of paper or communicate in any way).

If *every single prisoner* finds their own number, all prisoners are freed. If even one prisoner fails to find their number, all prisoners are executed.

What strategy should the prisoners employ to maximize their chances of survival?

## The Naive Approach and Why It Fails

The most straightforward approach is for each prisoner to randomly open 50 drawers.  This seems reasonable, as they have a 50% chance of finding their own number. However, this strategy leads to dismal results.

The probability of *one* prisoner finding their number is indeed 50%.  But for *all* 100 prisoners to succeed independently, the probability is (1/2)^100, which is an incredibly small number – practically zero.  This naive approach is doomed to fail.

## The Winning Strategy: The Loop Method

The surprisingly effective strategy relies on the idea of finding cycles or loops within the random arrangement of numbers in the drawers.  Here's how it works:

1.  **Each prisoner starts by opening the drawer with their own number on it.**

2.  **Inside that drawer, they'll find another number. They then open the drawer with that number on it.**

3.  **They continue this process, following the chain of numbers, until they either find their own number or they've opened 50 drawers.**

Essentially, each prisoner is following a chain or loop of numbers within the drawers. The success of this strategy hinges on the length of the longest loop in the arrangement. If the longest loop is longer than 50, then at least one prisoner won't be able to find their number within their allotted 50 attempts.  If all loops are 50 or shorter, then everyone will find their number.

## Why This Strategy Works: Loop Lengths and Probability

The key to understanding why this strategy works lies in the probability of the longest loop being 50 or less.  It might seem counterintuitive that searching based on loops would be more effective than random selection, but it drastically improves the odds.

Consider the case where a loop contains the number *x*. If prisoner *x* starts by opening the drawer labeled *x* and follows the chain of numbers, they *must* find their own number eventually (assuming the drawers haven't been tampered with).

The probability that the longest cycle is longer than 50 is actually lower than you might expect. Let's explore this further using a simulation.

## Python Simulation of the 100 Prisoners Problem

Let's write some Python code to simulate the 100 prisoners problem and test the effectiveness of the loop-following strategy.

```python
import random

def simulate_prisoners(num_prisoners=100, max_attempts=50):
  """Simulates the 100 prisoners problem using the loop-following strategy.

  Args:
    num_prisoners: The number of prisoners (and drawers).
    max_attempts: The maximum number of drawers each prisoner can open.

  Returns:
    True if all prisoners find their number, False otherwise.
  """

  # Create a random permutation of numbers representing the drawer contents
  drawers = list(range(1, num_prisoners + 1))
  random.shuffle(drawers)

  # Simulate each prisoner's search
  for prisoner_number in range(1, num_prisoners + 1):
    attempts = 0
    drawer_to_open = prisoner_number
    found = False

    while attempts < max_attempts:
      attempts += 1
      drawer_index = drawer_to_open - 1  # Adjust for 0-based indexing
      number_in_drawer = drawers[drawer_index]

      if number_in_drawer == prisoner_number:
        found = True
        break

      drawer_to_open = number_in_drawer

    if not found:
      return False  # One prisoner failed, so they all fail

  return True  # All prisoners succeeded


def run_simulations(num_simulations=1000, num_prisoners=100, max_attempts=50):
  """Runs multiple simulations and calculates the success rate."""

  successes = 0
  for _ in range(num_simulations):
    if simulate_prisoners(num_prisoners, max_attempts):
      successes += 1

  success_rate = successes / num_simulations
  return success_rate


if __name__ == "__main__":
  num_simulations = 1000
  success_rate = run_simulations(num_simulations)

  print(f"Running {num_simulations} simulations:")
  print(f"Success rate using the loop strategy: {success_rate:.4f}")

  # Expected probability of success (approximation based on loop length)
  expected_probability = 1 - sum(1 / k for k in range(51, 101))
  print(f"Approximate Expected Success Probability: {expected_probability:.4f}")


  #Compare results with the naive approach
  naive_successes = 0
  for _ in range(num_simulations):
    drawers = list(range(1, 101))
    random.shuffle(drawers)
    naive_win = True
    for prisoner_number in range(1, 101):
      found = False
      for _ in range(50):
        random_index = random.randint(0,99)
        if drawers[random_index] == prisoner_number:
          found = True
          break
      if not found:
        naive_win = False
        break
    if naive_win:
      naive_successes +=1

  naive_success_rate = naive_successes/num_simulations
  print(f"\nSuccess rate using the naive approach: {naive_success_rate:.4f}") #should be close to 0
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

*   `simulate_prisoners(num_prisoners, max_attempts)`:  This function performs a single simulation of the puzzle. It creates a random permutation representing the contents of the drawers. Then, for each prisoner, it follows the loop strategy. If any prisoner fails to find their number, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

*   `run_simulations(num_simulations, num_prisoners, max_attempts)`: This function runs multiple simulations and calculates the success rate. It calls `simulate_prisoners()` `num_simulations` times and keeps track of the number of successes.

*   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block runs the simulation and prints the results.  It also calculates and prints an approximate expected success probability based on the formula: `1 - sum(1 / k for k in range(51, 101))`.  This formula represents the probability that the longest loop is 50 or less.  The code also demonstrates a simulation of the naive approach for comparison

**Running the Code:**

When you run this code, you'll see a success rate significantly higher than (1/2)^100.  The success rate typically hovers around 30-35%, confirming the effectiveness of the loop-following strategy.

## The Mathematics Behind the Success

The probability of success using this strategy can be calculated as follows.  Let *P(n)* be the probability of success for *n* prisoners and *n* drawers. The prisoners succeed if the longest cycle has length at most *n*/2. The probability that a random permutation of length *n* contains a cycle of length *k* is 1/*k*. Therefore,

P(n) = 1 - (1/(n/2 + 1) + 1/(n/2 + 2) + ... + 1/n)

This probability converges to approximately 31.18% for n = 100.

## Conclusion

The 100 prisoners problem is a fascinating example of how a seemingly simple puzzle can have a surprisingly complex and elegant solution. The loop-following strategy demonstrates the power of thinking outside the box and using clever algorithms to significantly improve your chances of success, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.  It highlights how understanding the underlying mathematical principles can lead to remarkably effective strategies. So, the next time you're faced with a challenging problem, remember the 100 prisoners – sometimes, the key to success lies in finding the right loop!
