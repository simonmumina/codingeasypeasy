# Create a CMD Alarm Clock: A Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Windows Command Line Alarm

Want a simple alarm clock that doesn't rely on bulky applications or internet connectivity? You can build your own right in the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) using batch scripting! This tutorial will guide you through creating a functional and customizable CMD-based alarm clock. It's a fun project that introduces you to basic batch scripting principles and can be surprisingly useful.

## Why a CMD Alarm Clock?

While Windows has a built-in alarm feature, building your own CMD alarm clock offers several advantages:

- **Customization:** Tailor the alarm sound, message, and behavior to your exact preferences.
- **Lightweight:** Batch scripts are incredibly lightweight, consuming minimal resources.
- **No Dependencies:** It relies solely on the Windows command interpreter, no external programs needed.
- **Learning Opportunity:** A great way to learn about batch scripting and command-line automation.
- **Offline Functionality:** Works entirely offline without needing an internet connection.
- **Fun Project:** It's a satisfying project to build something useful from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows computer.
- A text editor (Notepad is sufficient, but Notepad++ or VS Code are recommended).
- Basic understanding of command prompt.

## Step 1: The Core Alarm Script (`alarm.bat`)

Let's start with the core script. Create a new text file named `alarm.bat` and paste the following code into it:

```plaintext
@echo off
title CMD Alarm Clock

:INPUT
set /p "alarm_time=Enter alarm time (HH:MM in 24-hour format): "

echo Setting alarm for %alarm_time%...

:CHECKTIME
for /f "tokens=1-2 delims=:" %%a in ("%time:~0,5%") do (
    set /a hour=%%a
    set /a minute=%%b
)

for /f "tokens=1-2 delims=:" %%c in ("%alarm_time%") do (
    set /a alarm_hour=%%c
    set /a alarm_minute=%%d
)

if %alarm_hour% EQU %hour% if %alarm_minute% EQU %minute% goto ALARM

timeout /t 60 /nobreak >nul
goto CHECKTIME

:ALARM
echo Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!
echo Time to wake up!
echo.
echo Press any key to snooze (1 minute), or close this window to stop the alarm.

:SNOOZE_CHECK
choice /t 60 /d y /n /m "Alarm Snoozing"

if errorlevel 1 goto INPUT  (This is for if enter is pressed immediately or after 60 seconds)

goto INPUT
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

- `@echo off`: Disables command echoing, keeping the output clean.
- `title CMD Alarm Clock`: Sets the window title.
- `:INPUT`: A label marking the beginning of the input loop.
- `set /p "alarm_time=..."`: Prompts the user to enter the alarm time in HH:MM format using 24 hour format. The input is stored in the `alarm_time` variable.
- `echo Setting alarm for %alarm_time%...`: Confirms the alarm time set.
- `:CHECKTIME`: A label marking the beginning of the time-checking loop.
- `for /f "tokens=1-2 delims=:" %%a in ("%time:~0,5%") do ...`: This extracts the current hour and minute from the `%time%` environment variable. `%time:~0,5%` extracts the first 5 characters (HH:MM). The `for /f` command splits the time string into tokens using the colon (`:`) as the delimiter. `%%a` and `%%b` become variables holding the hour and minute, respectively. The `set /a` command is used for arithmetic assignment, converting strings to integers. This is also done for alarm time set by the user.
- `if %alarm_hour% EQU %hour% if %alarm_minute% EQU %minute% goto ALARM`: Compares the current time with the alarm time. If they match, the script jumps to the `:ALARM` section. The `EQU` operator performs a case-insensitive equality comparison for strings.
- `timeout /t 60 /nobreak >nul`: Pauses the script for 60 seconds without displaying a prompt and redirecting the output to nul to suppress the default message. The `/nobreak` option prevents the user from interrupting the timeout with a key press.
- `goto CHECKTIME`: Loops back to the `:CHECKTIME` label to check the time again.
- `:ALARM`: A label marking the start of the alarm sequence.
- `echo Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!`: Displays the alarm message. You can customize this with whatever message you like.
- `echo Time to wake up!`: Another customizable alarm message.
- `echo.`: Prints a blank line for better readability.
- `echo Press any key to snooze (1 minute), or close this window to stop the alarm.`: Informs the user about the snooze option.
- `:SNOOZE_CHECK`: A label for snooze check.
- `choice /t 60 /d y /n /m "Alarm Snoozing"`: Waits for user input for up to 60 seconds. `/t 60` sets the timeout to 60 seconds. `/d y` sets the default choice to 'y' (meaning pressing Enter immediately snoozes the alarm). `/n` hides the choices. `/m "Alarm Snoozing"` displays a message instead of the default choice prompt.
- `if errorlevel 1 goto INPUT`: If the user presses Enter (resulting in errorlevel 1) or the timeout expires, the script loops back to the INPUT label, effectively snoozing the alarm for 1 minute.
- `goto INPUT`: After the snooze delay, the alarm resets for the next minute.

## Step 2: Running the Script

1.  Save the `alarm.bat` file.
2.  Double-click the `alarm.bat` file to run it.
3.  The command prompt window will appear, prompting you to enter the alarm time.
4.  Enter the desired alarm time in HH:MM format (e.g., 07:30 for 7:30 AM).
5.  The script will then wait until the specified time and trigger the alarm.

## Step 3: Customization

- **Alarm Sound:** The current script simply displays a message. You can add an alarm sound using the `start` command:

  ```plaintext
  :ALARM
  echo Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!
  echo Time to wake up!
  start /min "" "C:\Windows\Media\Alarm01.wav"
  echo.
  echo Press any key to snooze (1 minute), or close this window to stop the alarm.
  ```

  Replace `"C:\Windows\Media\Alarm01.wav"` with the path to your desired sound file. The `/min` ensures that the sound plays in a minimized window preventing CMD from displaying a new window. The empty string `""` is required as first argument to start a file with whitespace in the path.

  **Important:** Make sure the sound file exists at the specified path.

- **Alarm Message:** Customize the `echo` messages in the `:ALARM` section to personalize the alarm.

- **Snooze Time:** Modify the `timeout /t 60` command to adjust the snooze duration (in seconds). Also modify the snooze message.
- **Number of Snoozes**: You can limit the number of snoozes by adding a counter and exiting after a certain number of snoozes.

  ```plaintext
  @echo off
  title CMD Alarm Clock

  set snooze_count=0
  set max_snoozes=3

  :INPUT
  set /p "alarm_time=Enter alarm time (HH:MM in 24-hour format): "

  echo Setting alarm for %alarm_time%...

  :CHECKTIME
  for /f "tokens=1-2 delims=:" %%a in ("%time:~0,5%") do (
      set /a hour=%%a
      set /a minute=%%b
  )

  for /f "tokens=1-2 delims=:" %%c in ("%alarm_time%") do (
      set /a alarm_hour=%%c
      set /a alarm_minute=%%d
  )

  if %alarm_hour% EQU %hour% if %alarm_minute% EQU %minute% goto ALARM

  timeout /t 60 /nobreak >nul
  goto CHECKTIME

  :ALARM
  echo Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!
  echo Time to wake up!
  echo.
  echo Press any key to snooze (1 minute), or close this window to stop the alarm.

  :SNOOZE_CHECK
  if %snooze_count% GEQ %max_snoozes% goto NO_MORE_SNOOZES

  choice /t 60 /d y /n /m "Alarm Snoozing (Snooze %snooze_count%/%max_snoozes%)"

  if errorlevel 1 (
      set /a snooze_count+=1
      goto INPUT
  )

  goto NO_MORE_SNOOZES

  :NO_MORE_SNOOZES
  echo No more snoozes allowed!
  pause
  exit
  ```

## Step 4: Scheduling the Alarm (Optional)

To make the alarm clock run automatically at a specific time each day, you can use the Windows Task Scheduler.

1.  Search for "Task Scheduler" in the Windows Start Menu and open it.
2.  Click "Create Basic Task" in the right-hand panel.
3.  Enter a name for the task (e.g., "CMD Alarm Clock") and click "Next."
4.  Choose a trigger (e.g., "Daily") and click "Next."
5.  Set the start time and recurrence frequency and click "Next."
6.  Select "Start a program" and click "Next."
7.  In the "Program/script" field, enter `cmd.exe`.
8.  In the "Add arguments" field, enter `/c start "" "path\to\alarm.bat"`. Replace `"path\to\alarm.bat"` with the actual path to your `alarm.bat` file. Note the empty string `""` is required as first argument to start a batch file, otherwise `cmd.exe` will treat the path as the argument.
9.  Click "Next" and then "Finish."
10. You may be prompted for your account password to create the task.

Now, the alarm clock will run automatically at the scheduled time each day.

## Troubleshooting

- **Alarm doesn't go off:** Double-check that the alarm time is entered correctly (in 24-hour format). Ensure the system time is accurate.
- **Script exits immediately:** Make sure you haven't accidentally closed the command prompt window. Also, if the snooze count is exceeded, the script will exit.
- **Sound doesn't play:** Verify that the sound file exists at the specified path and is a valid sound file format that Windows can play (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`). Ensure your computer's audio is not muted.
- **Task Scheduler issue:** Double-check the path to the `alarm.bat` file in the Task Scheduler settings. Make sure the task is enabled.

## Conclusion

You've now built your own CMD-based alarm clock using batch scripting! This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of the Windows command line. Feel free to experiment with the code, add new features, and customize the alarm to your liking. Happy scripting!
