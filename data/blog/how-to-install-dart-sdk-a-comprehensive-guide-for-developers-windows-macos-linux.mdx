# How to Install Dart SDK: A Comprehensive Guide for Developers (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Dart is a powerful and versatile programming language developed by Google. It's the foundation for Flutter, a popular cross-platform UI toolkit for building beautiful natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on how to install the Dart SDK on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, ensuring you can start your Dart and Flutter journey with ease.

## Why Install the Dart SDK?

The Dart SDK (Software Development Kit) is essential for developing Dart applications. It includes:

- **Dart Compiler (dart2js, dartdevc):** Compiles Dart code into JavaScript or native code.
- **Dart VM (Virtual Machine):** A runtime environment for executing Dart code.
- **Dart Analyzer:** Performs static analysis of your code, helping you catch errors early.
- **Dart Packages and Libraries:** A rich ecosystem of pre-built components to accelerate your development.
- **Dart Command-Line Tools (dart, pub):** Tools for compiling, running, testing, and managing Dart projects.

Without the Dart SDK, you won't be able to compile, run, or develop Dart applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Basic understanding of the command line/terminal.**
- **Internet connection** for downloading the SDK.
- **Text editor or IDE:** (Optional but recommended) such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Android Studio. These IDEs often have Dart and Flutter extensions that simplify development.

## Installation on Windows

Here's how to install the Dart SDK on Windows:

1.  **Download the Dart SDK:**

    - Go to the official Dart SDK download page: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
    - Under the "Get the Dart SDK" section, find the "Windows" option.
    - Choose the appropriate installation package (typically the "stable" channel). The download will likely be a zip file.

2.  **Extract the SDK:**

    - Locate the downloaded zip file (e.g., `dart-sdk-windows-x64-release.zip`).
    - Extract the contents of the zip file to a location on your computer. A common location is `C:\src\dart-sdk` or `C:\tools\dart-sdk`. Avoid paths with spaces, as they can sometimes cause issues with command-line tools.
    - **Important:** Remember the path where you extracted the SDK. You'll need it in the next step.

3.  **Update the System Environment Variables:**

    - This is the crucial step that makes Dart accessible from your command line.
    - Search for "environment variables" in the Windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables."
    - Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
    - In the "System variables" section (the lower section), find the "Path" variable and select it.
    - Click the "Edit..." button.
    - Click "New" and add the path to the `bin` directory within your Dart SDK directory. For example, if you extracted the SDK to `C:\src\dart-sdk`, you would add `C:\src\dart-sdk\bin`.
    - Click "OK" on all the dialog boxes to save the changes.

4.  **Verify the Installation:**

    - Open a new command prompt (or restart your existing one to ensure the environment variables are updated).
    - Type `dart --version` and press Enter.
    - If the installation was successful, you should see the Dart SDK version number printed in the console. For example:

      ```plaintext
      Dart SDK version: 3.2.0 (stable) (Tue Oct 24 16:39:49 2023 +0000) on "windows_x64"
      ```

    - If you see an error like "'dart' is not recognized as an internal or external command," double-check that you correctly added the `bin` directory to your Path environment variable and that you restarted your command prompt.

## Installation on macOS

Here's how to install the Dart SDK on macOS:

1.  **Download the Dart SDK:**

    - Go to the official Dart SDK download page: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
    - Under the "Get the Dart SDK" section, find the "macOS" option.
    - Choose the appropriate installation package (typically the "stable" channel). The download will likely be a zip file.

2.  **Extract the SDK:**

    - Locate the downloaded zip file (e.g., `dart-sdk-macos-x64-release.zip`).
    - Extract the contents of the zip file to a location on your computer. A common location is `~/development/dart-sdk` or `/usr/local/share/dart-sdk`. You can use the command line for this:

      ```plaintext
      mkdir ~/development
      cd ~/development
      unzip ~/Downloads/dart-sdk-macos-x64-release.zip
      mv dart-sdk dart-sdk  # Rename to just 'dart-sdk'
      ```

    - **Important:** Remember the path where you extracted the SDK. You'll need it in the next step.

3.  **Update the System Environment Variables:**

    - macOS uses different shell configurations. The most common shell is Zsh. You'll need to edit the `.zshrc` file in your home directory. If you use Bash, you would edit `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`.

    - Open your terminal.

    - Open the `.zshrc` file in a text editor using `nano` or `vim` (or your preferred editor):

      ```plaintext
      nano ~/.zshrc
      ```

      or

      ```plaintext
      vim ~/.zshrc
      ```

    - Add the following lines to the end of the file, replacing `/Users/yourusername/development/dart-sdk` with the actual path where you extracted the SDK:

      ```plaintext
      export DART_SDK=/Users/yourusername/development/dart-sdk
      export PATH="$PATH:$DART_SDK/bin"
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `/Users/yourusername` with your actual macOS username.

    - Save the file and close the editor. In `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`. In `vim`, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

4.  **Activate the Changes:**

    - You need to tell the shell to reload the updated environment variables. Run the following command:

      ```plaintext
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```

      If you edited `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`, use the corresponding command: `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.bashrc`.

5.  **Verify the Installation:**

    - Open a new terminal window (or restart your existing one to ensure the environment variables are updated).
    - Type `dart --version` and press Enter.
    - If the installation was successful, you should see the Dart SDK version number printed in the console. For example:

      ```plaintext
      Dart SDK version: 3.2.0 (stable) (Tue Oct 24 16:39:49 2023 +0000) on "macos_x64"
      ```

    - If you see an error like "dart: command not found," double-check that you correctly added the `bin` directory to your PATH environment variable in the correct shell configuration file and that you sourced the file.

## Installation on Linux

Here's how to install the Dart SDK on Linux:

1.  **Download the Dart SDK:**

    - Go to the official Dart SDK download page: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
    - Under the "Get the Dart SDK" section, find the "Linux" option.
    - Choose the appropriate installation package (typically the "stable" channel). The download will likely be a zip file.

2.  **Extract the SDK:**

    - Locate the downloaded zip file (e.g., `dart-sdk-linux-x64-release.zip`).
    - Extract the contents of the zip file to a location on your computer. A common location is `~/development/dart-sdk` or `/opt/dart-sdk`. You can use the command line for this:

      ```plaintext
      mkdir ~/development
      cd ~/development
      unzip ~/Downloads/dart-sdk-linux-x64-release.zip
      mv dart-sdk dart-sdk # Rename to just 'dart-sdk'
      ```

    - **Important:** Remember the path where you extracted the SDK. You'll need it in the next step.

3.  **Update the System Environment Variables:**

    - Similar to macOS, Linux uses shell configuration files to set environment variables. The most common is Bash. You'll need to edit the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

    - Open your terminal.

    - Open the `.bashrc` file in a text editor using `nano` or `vim` (or your preferred editor):

      ```plaintext
      nano ~/.bashrc
      ```

      or

      ```plaintext
      vim ~/.bashrc
      ```

    - Add the following lines to the end of the file, replacing `/home/yourusername/development/dart-sdk` with the actual path where you extracted the SDK:

      ```plaintext
      export DART_SDK=/home/yourusername/development/dart-sdk
      export PATH="$PATH:$DART_SDK/bin"
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `/home/yourusername` with your actual Linux username.

    - Save the file and close the editor. In `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`. In `vim`, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

4.  **Activate the Changes:**

    - You need to tell the shell to reload the updated environment variables. Run the following command:

      ```plaintext
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

5.  **Verify the Installation:**

    - Open a new terminal window (or restart your existing one to ensure the environment variables are updated).
    - Type `dart --version` and press Enter.
    - If the installation was successful, you should see the Dart SDK version number printed in the console. For example:

      ```plaintext
      Dart SDK version: 3.2.0 (stable) (Tue Oct 24 16:39:49 2023 +0000) on "linux_x64"
      ```

    - If you see an error like "dart: command not found," double-check that you correctly added the `bin` directory to your PATH environment variable in the `.bashrc` file and that you sourced the file.

## Using `dart pub global activate` (Not Recommended for SDK Installation)

While you can use `dart pub global activate` to install certain Dart command-line tools, it's **not a substitute for installing the full Dart SDK.** It installs packages globally, but still relies on having the Dart SDK installed. Trying to use this _without_ the SDK installed will lead to errors.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **"dart: command not found" or "'dart' is not recognized as an internal or external command":** This is the most common issue and usually means the `bin` directory of the Dart SDK is not correctly added to your system's PATH environment variable. Double-check the steps above, ensuring the path is accurate and that you restarted your command prompt/terminal or sourced the relevant configuration file.

- **Permissions issues:** On Linux and macOS, you might encounter permission issues when extracting the SDK or running Dart commands. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the chosen installation directory. If needed, use `sudo` when extracting (carefully!) or change the directory ownership using `chown`. Avoid running `dart` commands as `sudo` normally.

- **Incorrect SDK path:** Double-check the path you added to your environment variables. Make sure it points to the correct directory containing the `bin` folder.

- **Conflicting Dart SDK installations:** If you have multiple Dart SDK installations, make sure the correct one is being used by your system. You might need to adjust your environment variables to prioritize the desired SDK.

## Creating a Simple Dart Program

After successfully installing the Dart SDK, let's create a simple program to verify that everything is working correctly.

1.  **Create a new file named `hello.dart`:**

    ```plaintext
    void main() {
      print('Hello, Dart!');
    }
    ```

2.  **Open your command prompt/terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.dart`.**

3.  **Run the program using the `dart` command:**

    ```plaintext
    dart hello.dart
    ```

4.  **You should see "Hello, Dart!" printed in the console.**

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Dart SDK and run your first Dart program.
