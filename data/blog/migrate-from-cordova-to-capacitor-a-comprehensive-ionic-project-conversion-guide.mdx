# Migrate from Cordova to Capacitor: A Comprehensive Ionic Project Conversion Guide

If you've been developing hybrid mobile applications with Ionic using Cordova, you might be considering a move to Capacitor. Capacitor, built by the Ionic team, offers a modern and more streamlined approach to managing native functionalities and plugins. This guide will walk you through the entire process of migrating your Cordova-based Ionic project to Capacitor, covering everything from preparation to troubleshooting.

## Why Migrate to Capacitor?

Before we dive into the process, let's understand why you might want to migrate:

- **Modern Architecture:** Capacitor is built on a more modern architecture, offering better performance and flexibility compared to Cordova.
- **Official Ionic Support:** Capacitor is officially maintained by the Ionic team, ensuring better integration and support for Ionic frameworks.
- **Native Control:** Capacitor provides direct access to native APIs, allowing for greater control and customization.
- **Simplified Plugin Management:** Capacitor's plugin system is generally easier to manage and integrate with.
- **Cordova Plugin Compatibility:** Capacitor supports most existing Cordova plugins, making the migration process smoother.
- **Web-First Approach:** Capacitor encourages a web-first approach, making development more aligned with modern web development practices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. A recent version is recommended.
- **Ionic CLI:** The Ionic CLI is essential for managing Ionic projects. Install it globally using:

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g @ionic/cli
  # or
  yarn global add @ionic/cli
  ```

- **Cordova Project:** You should have an existing Cordova-based Ionic project.
- **Android Studio and Xcode:** If you plan to target Android and iOS platforms, you'll need Android Studio and Xcode installed, respectively. Make sure you have the necessary SDKs and tooling configured.
- **Basic understanding of Capacitor:** A basic understanding of Capacitor concepts is beneficial.

## Step-by-Step Migration Guide

Now, let's proceed with the migration process.

### 1. Update Ionic CLI and Dependencies

Ensure your Ionic CLI and project dependencies are up to date. This minimizes potential compatibility issues.

```plaintext
ionic doctor check
```

This command checks for common issues and provides guidance on updating dependencies. Follow its recommendations.

### 2. Install Capacitor Core and CLI

Install the Capacitor core dependencies and the Capacitor CLI in your project:

```plaintext
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli --save
# or
yarn add @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
```

### 3. Initialize Capacitor

Initialize Capacitor within your Ionic project:

```plaintext
ionic capacitor init
```

This command will prompt you for your app name and app ID (bundle ID). Choose these carefully, especially the app ID as it's difficult to change later. For example:

```
? What is the name of your app? MyAwesomeApp
? What should be the Package ID for your app? com.example.myawesomeapp
```

This command generates a `capacitor.config.json` (or `capacitor.config.ts`) file in your project root. This file contains the configuration for your Capacitor project. Open this file and review the settings, paying particular attention to the `appId`, `appName`, and `webDir` properties. The `webDir` property should point to the directory where your Ionic app's web assets are built (typically `www`).

Example `capacitor.config.json`:

```plaintext
{
  "appId": "com.example.myawesomeapp",
  "appName": "MyAwesomeApp",
  "webDir": "www",
  "bundledWebRuntime": false
}
```

### 4. Copy Web Assets

Copy your Ionic app's web assets (the contents of the `www` directory) into the specified `webDir` directory. The Ionic CLI provides a convenient command for this:

```plaintext
ionic build
npx cap copy
```

The `ionic build` command builds your Ionic app, generating the web assets. The `npx cap copy` command then copies these assets to the native platforms (Android and iOS).

### 5. Add Native Platforms

Add the native platforms you want to support (Android and/or iOS) to your Capacitor project:

```plaintext
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
```

These commands create native Android and iOS projects within your Capacitor project. These projects are located in the `android` and `ios` directories, respectively.

### 6. Open Native Projects

Open the native projects in their respective IDEs:

```plaintext
npx cap open android
npx cap open ios
```

This opens the Android project in Android Studio and the iOS project in Xcode. This allows you to configure the native projects, install plugins, and debug your app on native devices or simulators.

### 7. Install Cordova Plugins

Capacitor supports many existing Cordova plugins. You can install them using npm (or yarn). Capacitor will attempt to install the plugin's native dependencies as well. However, you may need to manually configure some plugins in the native projects.

For example, to install the Cordova camera plugin:

```plaintext
npm install cordova-plugin-camera
npx cap sync
```

The `npx cap sync` command synchronizes your Capacitor configuration with the native projects, including installing any necessary native dependencies for the Cordova plugins.

**Important Considerations for Cordova Plugins:**

- **Check Compatibility:** Not all Cordova plugins are fully compatible with Capacitor. Refer to the plugin's documentation or the Capacitor community for information on compatibility.
- **Native Configuration:** Some Cordova plugins may require manual configuration in the native projects (Android Studio and Xcode). Follow the plugin's instructions carefully.
- **Capacitor Alternatives:** Consider using Capacitor's official plugins whenever possible, as they are generally better integrated and maintained. For example, instead of `cordova-plugin-camera`, use `@capacitor/camera`.

### 8. Updating Native Dependencies

Sometimes, you might need to update the native dependencies of a plugin manually, especially after adding or removing plugins or when upgrading Capacitor. Use the following command:

```plaintext
npx cap update
```

This command updates the native project dependencies.

### 9. Testing on Devices and Simulators

Test your app on both Android and iOS devices and simulators. This is crucial for identifying any platform-specific issues. Use the debugging tools in Android Studio and Xcode to diagnose and fix any problems.

- **Android Studio:** Use the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager to create and manage virtual devices. Use the debugger to step through your code and inspect variables.
- **Xcode:** Use the Simulator to test on various iOS devices. Use the Instruments tool to profile your app's performance.

### 10. Handling Platform-Specific Code

Sometimes you'll need different code based on whether you're running on the web, Android, or iOS. Capacitor provides a convenient way to detect the platform using the `Capacitor.getPlatform()` method:

```plaintext
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core'

const platform = Capacitor.getPlatform()

if (platform === 'web') {
  // Code specific to the web platform
  console.log('Running in a browser')
} else if (platform === 'android') {
  // Code specific to the Android platform
  console.log('Running on Android')
} else if (platform === 'ios') {
  // Code specific to the iOS platform
  console.log('Running on iOS')
}
```

### 11. Deep Linking

If your Cordova app used deep linking, you'll need to configure it in Capacitor as well. This involves configuring the `capacitor.config.json` file and updating your native project settings. Refer to the Capacitor documentation for detailed instructions on deep linking.

### 12. Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter during the migration process and how to resolve them:

- **Plugin Compatibility Issues:** If a Cordova plugin is not compatible with Capacitor, try finding a Capacitor alternative or creating a custom plugin.
- **Build Errors:** Check the logs in Android Studio and Xcode for build errors. These errors often indicate missing dependencies or incorrect configuration. `npx cap doctor` is useful here as well.
- **Runtime Errors:** Use the debugging tools in Android Studio and Xcode to diagnose runtime errors. Check the JavaScript console for errors.
- **Permissions Issues:** Ensure your app has the necessary permissions to access native features. Configure the permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file (Android) and the `Info.plist` file (iOS).
- **UI Issues:** Test your app on different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure the UI looks correct.

### 13. Best Practices

- **Test Frequently:** Test your app frequently throughout the migration process to catch issues early.
- **Version Control:** Use version control (e.g., Git) to track your changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **Documentation:** Document your migration process, including any specific configuration changes or workarounds.
- **Community Support:** Leverage the Capacitor community for support and guidance.

## Example: Migrating the Camera Plugin

Let's walk through a specific example: migrating the Cordova camera plugin to the Capacitor camera plugin.

1.  **Remove Cordova Camera Plugin:**

    ```plaintext
    cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-camera
    # (If you previously used cordova)
    ```

2.  **Install Capacitor Camera Plugin:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install @capacitor/camera
    # or
    yarn add @capacitor/camera
    ```

3.  **Sync Capacitor:**

    ```plaintext
    npx cap sync
    ```

4.  **Update Code:** Modify your code to use the Capacitor camera API. Here's an example:

    ```plaintext
    import { Camera, CameraResultType, CameraSource } from '@capacitor/camera'

    async function takePicture() {
      try {
        const image = await Camera.getPhoto({
          quality: 90,
          allowEditing: true,
          resultType: CameraResultType.Base64,
          source: CameraSource.Camera, // Or CameraSource.Photos for the gallery
        })

        // image.base64 is the base64 encoded image
        console.log('Image data:', image.base64)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error taking picture:', error)
      }
    }
    ```

This example demonstrates how to use the Capacitor camera plugin to take a picture and get the base64 encoded image data.

## Conclusion

Migrating from Cordova to Capacitor can significantly improve your Ionic app's performance, maintainability, and access to native features. While the process may seem daunting at first, following this comprehensive guide will help you navigate the migration smoothly. Remember to test frequently, leverage the Capacitor community, and document your changes. Good luck!
