# Secure Authentication with Magic Links in Flask: JWTs vs. One-Time Codes

Magic links offer a streamlined and secure alternative to traditional password-based authentication. Instead of requiring users to remember a password, they receive a unique link via email that grants them immediate access to your application. This blog post dives deep into implementing magic links in Flask, exploring two popular methods: JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) and one-time codes. We'll cover the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, provide detailed code examples, and discuss security considerations.

## What are Magic Links?

Magic links are essentially one-time-use URLs that contain a secure token. When a user clicks the link, the token is validated, and they are automatically logged in. This eliminates the need for password management, improving user experience and reducing the risk of password-related security breaches.

## Why Use Magic Links?

- **Improved User Experience:** Passwordless login simplifies the authentication process, making it faster and more convenient for users.
- **Enhanced Security:** Eliminates the need for users to create and remember passwords, reducing the risk of weak or compromised passwords.
- **Reduced Support Overhead:** Fewer password reset requests translate to less support burden for your team.
- **Increased Conversion Rates:** A frictionless login process can lead to higher user engagement and conversion rates.

## Methods for Generating Magic Links in Flask

We'll explore two common methods:

1.  **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens):** Using JWTs to encode user information and an expiration timestamp into the magic link.
2.  **One-Time Codes:** Generating and storing a unique, randomly generated code that is associated with the user.

### 1. Magic Links with JWTs

JWTs are a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In the context of magic links, we can encode the user's ID and an expiration time into the JWT. Upon clicking the link, the JWT is verified to ensure its validity and that it hasn't expired.

**Pros:**

- **Stateless:** The server doesn't need to store any session information about the JWT. The token itself contains all the necessary data.
- **Scalable:** Statelessness makes it easier to scale your application horizontally.
- **Standardized:** JWT is a well-established standard with libraries available in many languages.

**Cons:**

- **Revocation Challenges:** Once a JWT is issued, it cannot be easily revoked before its expiration time without implementing more complex revocation mechanisms (like blacklisting).
- **Size:** JWTs can be relatively large, especially if you include a lot of data in the payload.
- **Security Risks:** Requires careful implementation to prevent vulnerabilities such as token theft or replay attacks.

**Implementation in Flask:**

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, redirect
from flask_mail import Mail, Message
import jwt
import datetime
from functools import wraps
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'your_secret_key') # Use environment variable in production
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_SERVER', 'smtp.example.com')
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = int(os.environ.get('MAIL_PORT', 587))
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
app.config['MAIL_USE_SSL'] = False
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_USERNAME', 'your_email@example.com')
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'your_email_password')
app.config['MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER', 'no-reply@example.com')

mail = Mail(app)

# Example User database (replace with a real database)
users = {
    1: {'email': 'user1@example.com', 'username': 'user1'},
    2: {'email': 'user2@example.com', 'username': 'user2'}
}

# Helper function to generate JWT
def generate_token(user_id):
    payload = {
        'user_id': user_id,
        'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)  # Link expires in 30 minutes
    }
    return jwt.encode(payload, app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithm='HS256')

# Helper function to verify JWT
def verify_token(token):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithms=['HS256'])
        return payload['user_id']
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        return None  # Token has expired
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        return None  # Invalid token

# Helper function to send email
def send_email(email, link):
    msg = Message('Login Link', recipients=[email])
    msg.body = f'Click the following link to log in: {link}'
    mail.send(msg)


@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    email = request.form.get('email')
    # In a real application, you'd query your database for the user by email
    user = next((user for user_id, user in users.items() if user['email'] == email), None)

    if not user:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid email address'}), 400

    token = generate_token(user_id=next((user_id for user_id, u in users.items() if u['email'] == email), None)) # Get user_id from email
    link = f'http://localhost:5000/verify/{token}' #Replace with your actual domain
    send_email(email, link)

    return jsonify({'message': 'Login link sent to your email address'}), 200


@app.route('/verify/<token>')
def verify(token):
    user_id = verify_token(token)
    if user_id:
        # Authenticate the user (e.g., set a session cookie)
        # In a real application, you'd fetch user data from the database
        user = users.get(user_id)
        # For this example, we'll just return a success message
        return jsonify({'message': f'Successfully logged in as {user["username"]}'}), 200
        # Consider redirecting to a profile page here.
        # return redirect('/profile')
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid or expired link'}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`generate_token(user_id)`:** Generates a JWT containing the user ID and an expiration timestamp. The `jwt.encode` function uses the app's secret key and the `HS256` algorithm (HMAC with SHA-256) to sign the token. **Important: Never hardcode the secret key in your code. Always use an environment variable.**
- **`verify_token(token)`:** Verifies the JWT. It decodes the token using the secret key and checks for expiration. If the token is valid, it returns the user ID; otherwise, it returns `None`.
- **`/login` route:** Handles the initial login request. It receives the user's email, generates a JWT, constructs the magic link, and sends the link via email.
- **`/verify/<token>` route:** Handles the link verification. It extracts the token from the URL, verifies it using `verify_token`, and, if valid, authenticates the user. In a real application, you would typically create a session cookie or JWT for subsequent requests.

**Important Security Considerations for JWTs:**

- **Secret Key Management:** Protect your secret key at all costs. Store it securely, ideally using environment variables or a secrets management system. Never commit it to your code repository.
- **Algorithm Choice:** Use strong signing algorithms like `HS256`, `HS384`, or `HS512`. Avoid `None` algorithm.
- **Expiration Time:** Set a reasonable expiration time for your JWTs. Shorter expiration times improve security by limiting the window of opportunity for attackers.
- **Token Storage:** Store JWTs securely on the client-side. Consider using HTTP-only cookies to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** If you are storing JWTs in local storage, implement CSRF protection measures.

### 2. Magic Links with One-Time Codes

This approach involves generating a random, unique code and storing it in your database, linked to the user account. When the user clicks the magic link, the code is verified against the database, and if it matches, the user is authenticated. The code is then immediately invalidated (e.g., by deleting it from the database or setting an `used` flag).

**Pros:**

- **Easy Revocation:** You can easily revoke a magic link by deleting or invalidating the code in the database.
- **Simpler Implementation:** Generally easier to implement than JWT-based solutions, especially for beginners.
- **Fine-Grained Control:** Offers more control over the validity of the magic link.

**Cons:**

- **Stateful:** Requires storing the one-time codes in your database.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Database reads and writes can become a bottleneck as your application scales.
- **Database Dependency:** Relies on the availability and performance of your database.

**Implementation in Flask:**

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, redirect
from flask_mail import Mail, Message
import secrets
import datetime
from functools import wraps
import os
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'your_secret_key')
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_SERVER', 'smtp.example.com')
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = int(os.environ.get('MAIL_PORT', 587))
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
app.config['MAIL_USE_SSL'] = False
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_USERNAME', 'your_email@example.com')
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'your_email_password')
app.config['MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER', 'no-reply@example.com')
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL', 'sqlite:///:memory:') #Use a real database in production
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

mail = Mail(app)
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    magic_code = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True, nullable=True) # Store one-time code
    magic_code_expiry = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)


with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()


# Helper function to generate a secure random code
def generate_magic_code():
    return secrets.token_urlsafe(32)  # Generates a 43 character random string

# Helper function to send email
def send_email(email, link):
    msg = Message('Login Link', recipients=[email])
    msg.body = f'Click the following link to log in: {link}'
    mail.send(msg)


@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    email = request.form.get('email')
    user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()

    if not user:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid email address'}), 400

    magic_code = generate_magic_code()
    user.magic_code = magic_code
    user.magic_code_expiry = datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)  # Code expires in 30 minutes
    db.session.commit()


    link = f'http://localhost:5000/verify/{magic_code}' #Replace with your actual domain
    send_email(email, link)

    return jsonify({'message': 'Login link sent to your email address'}), 200


@app.route('/verify/<magic_code>')
def verify(magic_code):
    user = User.query.filter_by(magic_code=magic_code).first()

    if user and user.magic_code_expiry > datetime.datetime.utcnow():
        # Authenticate the user (e.g., set a session cookie)
        # For this example, we'll just return a success message
        user.magic_code = None  # Invalidate the code
        user.magic_code_expiry = None
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({'message': f'Successfully logged in as {user.username}'}), 200
        # Consider redirecting to a profile page here.
        # return redirect('/profile')
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid or expired link'}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`generate_magic_code()`:** Generates a secure, random code using `secrets.token_urlsafe()`. This function is cryptographically secure.
- **`/login` route:** Generates a new magic code, stores it in the database (associated with the user), sets an expiry time, and sends the link via email.
- **`/verify/<magic_code>` route:** Retrieves the user based on the magic code, checks if the code is still valid (not expired), authenticates the user, and then **invalidates the magic code** by setting `user.magic_code = None` in the database and committing the changes.

**Important Security Considerations for One-Time Codes:**

- **Code Length and Randomness:** Use a sufficiently long and random code to prevent brute-force attacks. `secrets.token_urlsafe()` is a good choice.
- **Database Security:** Secure your database to prevent unauthorized access to the magic codes.
- **Invalidation:** Always invalidate the magic code immediately after it has been used successfully.
- **Expiration Time:** Set a reasonable expiration time for your magic codes.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting magic links for the same email address.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and server.

## Choosing Between JWTs and One-Time Codes

Here's a quick summary to help you decide which method is best for your Flask application:

| Feature      | JWTs                                  | One-Time Codes                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Statefulness | Stateless                             | Stateful                             |
| Revocation   | Difficult (requires extra mechanisms) | Easy (invalidate in the database)    |
| Complexity   | More Complex                          | Simpler                              |
| Scalability  | More Scalable (stateless)             | Requires careful database management |
| Database     | Less Dependent                        | Dependent on the database            |

**Use JWTs if:**

- You need a stateless authentication solution.
- Scalability is a major concern.
- You are comfortable with the complexities of JWTs and their security implications.

**Use One-Time Codes if:**

- Easy revocation is crucial.
- You prefer a simpler implementation.
- You are comfortable managing the codes in your database.
- Your application doesn't require extreme scalability.

## Conclusion

Magic links provide a secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based authentication. Both JWTs and one-time codes offer viable solutions for implementing magic links in Flask. Choose the method that best suits your application's requirements and security considerations. Remember to prioritize security best practices, such as using strong secret keys, secure random code generation, and HTTPS, to protect your users and your application. Remember to replace the dummy email addresses and database configurations with your actual values. Always prioritize security and best practices in a production environment.
