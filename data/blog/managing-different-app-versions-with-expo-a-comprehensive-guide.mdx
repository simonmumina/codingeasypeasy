# Managing Different App Versions with Expo: A Comprehensive Guide

Maintaining and managing multiple versions of your React Native Expo application is crucial for a smooth development lifecycle, effective A/B testing, and a positive user experience. As your app evolves with new features and bug fixes, you need a robust strategy to handle different versions, especially when users are on various versions simultaneously. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to effectively manage app versions with Expo, leveraging tools like EAS Build and EAS Update.

## Why is Version Management Important?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand why version management is so important:

- **Bug Fixes:** Older app versions might have bugs that are fixed in newer versions. Handling these differences gracefully prevents users on older versions from experiencing recurring issues.
- **New Features:** You might want to roll out new features gradually to specific user groups (A/B testing) or only make them available in newer versions.
- **API Compatibility:** As your backend evolves, older app versions might become incompatible with new APIs.
- **Deprecation:** Eventually, you'll need to deprecate older versions to encourage users to upgrade to the latest, most secure, and feature-rich version.
- **Rollbacks:** A clear versioning strategy allows for quick rollbacks to previous stable versions if a new update introduces critical issues.

## Expo Tools for Version Management

Expo provides powerful tools for managing app versions throughout the development and deployment process:

- **`expo-constants`:** This package provides access to various app constants, including the app version, build number, and Expo SDK version.
- **`EAS Build`:** Expo Application Services (EAS) Build is a cloud build service that automates the process of creating native binaries (APK for Android and IPA for iOS) for your Expo app. It allows you to configure different build profiles for different environments (development, staging, production) and manage version codes and bundle identifiers.
- **`EAS Update`:** EAS Update enables you to push over-the-air (OTA) updates to your Expo app without requiring users to download a new version from the app store. This is ideal for bug fixes, minor feature enhancements, and A/B testing.
- **App.json/app.config.js:** This file (or its JavaScript counterpart) is the central configuration file for your Expo app. It contains crucial information like the app name, version, bundle identifier, and various settings for different platforms.

## Versioning Strategies

Here's a common and recommended versioning strategy that aligns well with Expo's ecosystem:

- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Follow SemVer principles (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for your app's `version` in `app.json` or `app.config.js`.
  - **MAJOR:** Increment when you make incompatible API changes.
  - **MINOR:** Increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
  - **PATCH:** Increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- **Build Number (versionCode/buildNumber):** Use incrementing build numbers (`android.versionCode` for Android and `ios.buildNumber` for iOS) to distinguish between builds with the same `version`. These are internal version identifiers used by the app stores. EAS Build helps automate the management of these.

### Example: `app.json` Configuration

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyAwesomeApp",
    "slug": "my-awesome-app",
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "updates": {
      "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": ["**/*"],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myawesomeapp",
      "buildNumber": "10" // Important for iOS releases
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
      },
      "package": "com.example.myawesomeapp",
      "versionCode": 12 // Important for Android releases
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    },
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `version`: The human-readable version of your app (e.g., 1.2.3). This is what users will see.
- `ios.buildNumber`: A monotonically increasing integer for iOS builds. Increase this with each build you submit to the App Store.
- `android.versionCode`: A monotonically increasing integer for Android builds. Increase this with each build you submit to the Play Store.
- `extra.eas.projectId`: The project ID that uniquely identifies your Expo project on EAS. Crucial for EAS Build and EAS Update.

### Automating Versioning with EAS Build

EAS Build simplifies the process of managing build numbers. You can use environment variables to automate the incrementing of `android.versionCode` and `ios.buildNumber` during the build process.

**Example: `eas.json` Configuration**

```plaintext
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildCounter": 1
      },
      "ios": {
        "buildNumber": "1.0.0"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "expo-channel",
      "android": {
        "buildCounter": 1
      },
      "ios": {
        "buildNumber": "1.0.0"
      },
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildCounter": 1
      },
      "ios": {
        "buildNumber": "1.0.0"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

And in your `app.json` you can use environment variables. Make sure you add these to EAS secrets.

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
      "ios": {
        "buildNumber": process.env.IOS_BUILD_NUMBER || "1.0.0"
      },
      "android": {
        "versionCode": parseInt(process.env.ANDROID_VERSION_CODE || "1")
      }
   }
}
```

When you trigger a build with `eas build`, EAS Build can automatically increment these values based on the defined `buildCounter` (for android) or if you're using environment variables from EAS Secrets. The first build will have `versionCode` 1 and `buildNumber` "1.0.0", the second `versionCode` will be 2, etc. You can specify different configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

## Accessing App Versions in Your Code

You can access the app version and build number in your React Native code using the `expo-constants` package.

```plaintext
import Constants from 'expo-constants'
import { Platform } from 'react-native'

const AppVersion = () => {
  const version = Constants.expoConfig?.version
  const buildNumber =
    Platform.OS === 'ios'
      ? Constants.expoConfig?.ios?.buildNumber
      : Constants.expoConfig?.android?.versionCode.toString()

  return (
    <>
      <Text>App Version: {version}</Text>
      <Text>Build Number: {buildNumber}</Text>
    </>
  )
}

export default AppVersion
```

**Explanation:**

- `Constants.expoConfig?.version`: Accesses the `version` field from your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.
- `Constants.expoConfig?.ios?.buildNumber`: Accesses the `buildNumber` field for iOS.
- `Constants.expoConfig?.android?.versionCode`: Accesses the `versionCode` field for Android.
- Platform.OS is used because ios uses `buildNumber` which is a string, and android uses `versionCode` which is a number.

## Handling Different Versions in Your App Logic

Now that you can access the app version, you can use it to implement different logic based on the version running on the user's device. Here are some common use cases:

- **Conditional Feature Availability:**

  ```plaintext
  import Constants from 'expo-constants'

  const ShowNewFeature = () => {
    const version = Constants.expoConfig?.version

    if (version && version >= '1.3.0') {
      return <NewFeatureComponent />
    } else {
      return null // Or a message like "Please update to the latest version"
    }
  }

  export default ShowNewFeature
  ```

- **API Endpoint Switching:**

  ```plaintext
  import Constants from 'expo-constants'

  const API_BASE_URL = () => {
    const version = Constants.expoConfig?.version

    if (version && version >= '1.4.0') {
      return 'https://api.example.com/v2' // Use newer API endpoint
    } else {
      return 'https://api.example.com/v1' // Use older API endpoint
    }
  }

  // Example usage:
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const url = `${API_BASE_URL()}/data`
    // ... fetch logic ...
  }
  ```

- **Forcing Updates (Discouraged but sometimes necessary):** This should be used very cautiously as it can negatively impact user experience. Consider using soft prompts instead.

  ```plaintext
  import Constants from 'expo-constants'
  import { Alert, Linking } from 'react-native'

  const CheckForUpdates = () => {
    const version = Constants.expoConfig?.version

    useEffect(() => {
      if (version && version < '1.5.0') {
        Alert.alert(
          'Update Required',
          'This version of the app is outdated. Please update to the latest version.',
          [
            {
              text: 'Update',
              onPress: () => {
                // Open the App Store or Play Store
                Linking.openURL(
                  Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'YOUR_APP_STORE_URL' : 'YOUR_PLAY_STORE_URL'
                )
              },
            },
          ],
          { cancelable: false }
        )
      }
    }, [])

    return null // Or some other UI component
  }

  export default CheckForUpdates
  ```

## EAS Update: Over-the-Air Updates

EAS Update is a game-changer for managing minor updates and bug fixes. It allows you to push code changes to your users without requiring them to download a new app version from the app store.

**Key Benefits of EAS Update:**

- **Faster Deployment:** Bypass the app store review process for minor updates.
- **Improved User Experience:** Users receive updates seamlessly in the background.
- **A/B Testing:** Roll out new features to specific user groups.
- **Rollbacks:** Quickly revert to a previous version if an update introduces issues.

**Example: Implementing EAS Update**

1.  **Install `expo-updates`:**

    ```plaintext
    npx expo install expo-updates
    ```

2.  **Configure `app.json`:**

    Ensure that you have configured the `updates` section in your `app.json` file, and that the `extra.eas.projectId` is set correctly.

    ```plaintext
    {
      "expo": {
        // ... other configurations ...
        "updates": {
          "url": "https://u.expo.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID" // Replace with your project ID
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Initialize Expo Updates:**

    ```plaintext
    import * as Updates from 'expo-updates'
    import { useEffect } from 'react'

    const App = () => {
      useEffect(() => {
        async function updateApp() {
          try {
            const update = await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()
            if (update.isAvailable) {
              await Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()
              await Updates.reloadAsync()
            }
          } catch (e) {
            // Handle errors gracefully (e.g., network issues)
            console.log('Error fetching update', e)
          }
        }

        updateApp()
      }, [])

      // ... rest of your app ...
    }

    export default App
    ```

4.  **Publish Updates with EAS CLI:**

    ```plaintext
    eas update --message "Fix: Resolved a critical bug"
    ```

**Explanation:**

- `Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()`: Checks if an update is available.
- `Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()`: Downloads the update.
- `Updates.reloadAsync()`: Applies the update by restarting the app.
- `eas update`: Publishes the update to your EAS project.

**Important Considerations for EAS Update:**

- **CodePush Compatibility:** EAS Update replaces CodePush for Expo projects.
- **Binary Compatibility:** EAS Update cannot change native code. For native code changes, you'll need to submit a new version to the app stores.
- **Channel Management:** Use EAS Update channels to target specific user groups (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `preview`).
- **Rollback Strategy:** Have a clear rollback strategy in case an update causes issues. You can rollback to a previous update using the EAS CLI.

## Best Practices for Version Management

- **Automate Versioning:** Integrate versioning into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically increment build numbers and update `app.json` or `app.config.js`.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (like API keys and build configuration) in environment variables and inject them into your builds.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your app on different devices and operating systems to ensure compatibility across versions.
- **Monitor Error Logs:** Use error monitoring tools (like Sentry or BugSnag) to track errors and crashes in different app versions.
- **Communicate Updates:** Inform users about new features and bug fixes in your release notes.
- **Consider Feature Flags:** For more complex feature releases, consider feature flags using libraries like Unleash or LaunchDarkly. These provide even more control over feature rollouts and A/B testing.

## Conclusion

Managing different app versions with Expo is a critical aspect of mobile development. By implementing a robust versioning strategy, leveraging tools like EAS Build and EAS Update, and following best practices, you can ensure a smooth development lifecycle, a positive user experience, and efficient maintenance of your React Native Expo application. Remember to choose the strategies and approaches that best fit your project's specific needs and complexity.
