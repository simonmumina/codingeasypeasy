# Chakra UI Tutorial: Build Beautiful & Accessible React UIs with Ease

Chakra UI has emerged as a leading React component library for building accessible, reusable, and visually appealing user interfaces. Its focus on developer experience, accessibility (a11y), and customization makes it a popular choice for both small projects and large-scale applications. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to getting started with Chakra UI and leveraging its features to create stunning UIs.

## What is Chakra UI?

Chakra UI is a simple, modular, and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications. It offers:

- **Accessibility by Default:** Components are designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to WAI-ARIA standards.
- **Composable Components:** Build complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components.
- **Theming and Styling:** Easily customize the look and feel of your application with a powerful theming system.
- **Developer Experience:** Chakra UI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear documentation and helpful error messages.
- **Performance:** Chakra UI is built with performance in mind, ensuring that your applications are fast and responsive.

## Why Choose Chakra UI?

- **Rapid Development:** Pre-built components save you time and effort compared to building everything from scratch.
- **Consistent Design:** The theming system helps maintain a consistent look and feel across your application.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Built-in accessibility features make your application more inclusive.
- **Clean and Readable Code:** Chakra UI's API is designed to be intuitive and easy to understand, leading to more maintainable code.
- **Strong Community Support:** A large and active community provides ample resources, support, and third-party extensions.

## Getting Started with Chakra UI

### 1. Installation

First, you need to install Chakra UI and its peer dependencies in your React project. Open your terminal and run the following command using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
# or
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
```

**Explanation:**

- `@chakra-ui/react`: The core Chakra UI library.
- `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`: Emotion is a CSS-in-JS library used by Chakra UI for styling.
- `framer-motion`: A popular library for creating animations and transitions, used by some Chakra UI components.

### 2. Setting up the ChakraProvider

To use Chakra UI components, you need to wrap your application with the `ChakraProvider`. This provider makes the theme and other utilities available to all components within your application.

Open your `src/index.js` or `src/App.js` file (or whichever file renders your root component) and add the following code:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ChakraProvider>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

### 3. Using Chakra UI Components

Now you're ready to use Chakra UI components in your application! Let's create a simple button:

```plaintext
import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button colorScheme="blue">Click Me!</Button>
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `Button` component from `@chakra-ui/react`.
- We use the `colorScheme` prop to set the color of the button to blue. Chakra UI provides several built-in color schemes.

## Core Concepts of Chakra UI

### 1. Theming

Chakra UI's theming system allows you to customize the look and feel of your application. You can modify colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

**Creating a Custom Theme:**

1.  Create a new file, for example, `src/theme.js`.
2.  Import `extendTheme` from `@chakra-ui/react`.
3.  Define your theme object and pass it to `extendTheme`.

```plaintext
// src/theme.js
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    brand: {
      900: '#1a365d',
      800: '#153e75',
      700: '#2a69ac',
    },
  },
  fonts: {
    heading: `'Open Sans', sans-serif`,
    body: `'Raleway', sans-serif`,
  },
})

export default theme
```

**Explanation:**

- We define a new color scheme called `brand` with different shades.
- We define custom fonts for headings and body text.

4.  Import your custom theme in `src/index.js` and pass it to the `ChakraProvider`.

```plaintext
// src/index.js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import theme from './theme' // Import your custom theme

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

Now you can use your custom theme in your components:

```plaintext
import { Button, useTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useTheme()
  return (
    <Button bg={theme.colors.brand[500]} color="white">
      Custom Button
    </Button>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

### 2. Responsive Styles

Chakra UI makes it easy to create responsive UIs using its responsive prop syntax. You can pass an object, array, or string to props to define different values for different screen sizes.

```plaintext
import { Box, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Box
      bg="gray.100"
      p={{ base: 4, md: 8 }} // Padding: 4 on small screens, 8 on medium screens and up
      textAlign={{ base: 'center', md: 'left' }} // Text alignment: center on small screens, left on medium screens and up
    >
      <Text fontSize={{ base: 'xl', md: '2xl' }}>Responsive Text</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- `base`: Styles applied to all screen sizes.
- `sm`: Styles applied to small screens (576px and up).
- `md`: Styles applied to medium screens (768px and up).
- `lg`: Styles applied to large screens (992px and up).
- `xl`: Styles applied to extra-large screens (1200px and up).
- `2xl`: Styles applied to 2x extra-large screens (1536px and up).

### 3. Layout Components

Chakra UI provides a set of layout components that make it easy to create common UI layouts. Some of the most useful layout components include:

- **Box:** A basic container component for grouping and styling content.
- **Flex:** For creating flexible layouts using CSS Flexbox.
- **Grid:** For creating grid-based layouts using CSS Grid.
- **Stack:** For stacking elements vertically or horizontally.

**Example using Flex:**

```plaintext
import { Flex, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Flex
      direction="row" // or "column"
      align="center" // Align items vertically
      justify="space-between" // Distribute items horizontally
      bg="teal.500"
      p={4}
      color="white"
    >
      <Box>Item 1</Box>
      <Box>Item 2</Box>
      <Box>Item 3</Box>
    </Flex>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Example using Grid:**

```plaintext
import { Grid, GridItem } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Grid templateColumns="repeat(3, 1fr)" gap={6}>
      <GridItem w="100%" h={10} bg="blue.500" />
      <GridItem w="100%" h={10} bg="blue.500" />
      <GridItem w="100%" h={10} bg="blue.500" />
      <GridItem w="100%" h={10} bg="blue.500" />
      <GridItem w="100%" h={10} bg="blue.500" />
      <GridItem w="100%" h={10} bg="blue.500" />
    </Grid>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

### 4. Component Composition

Chakra UI encourages component composition, which means building complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components. This approach makes your code more modular, maintainable, and testable.

**Example: Creating a custom Card component:**

```plaintext
import { Box, Heading, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function Card({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <Box borderWidth="1px" borderRadius="md" p={4} boxShadow="md">
      <Heading fontSize="xl" mb={2}>
        {title}
      </Heading>
      <Text>{description}</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default Card
```

Now you can use the `Card` component in your application:

```plaintext
import Card from './Card'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card title="My Card" description="This is a custom card component built with Chakra UI." />
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. useDisclosure Hook

The `useDisclosure` hook is a handy utility for managing the open/closed state of components like modals, drawers, and menus.

```plaintext
import {
  Button,
  Modal,
  ModalOverlay,
  ModalContent,
  ModalHeader,
  ModalBody,
  ModalCloseButton,
  useDisclosure,
} from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyComponent() {
  const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={onOpen}>Open Modal</Button>

      <Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}>
        <ModalOverlay />
        <ModalContent>
          <ModalHeader>Modal Title</ModalHeader>
          <ModalCloseButton />
          <ModalBody>This is the modal content.</ModalBody>
        </ModalContent>
      </Modal>
    </>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

### 2. Color Mode Switcher

Chakra UI makes it easy to implement a light/dark mode switcher in your application.

```plaintext
import { useColorMode, IconButton, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons'

function ColorModeSwitcher() {
  const { colorMode, toggleColorMode } = useColorMode()
  return (
    <IconButton
      aria-label="Toggle color mode"
      onClick={toggleColorMode}
      icon={colorMode === 'light' ? <MoonIcon /> : <SunIcon />}
    />
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Box p={4}>
      <ColorModeSwitcher />
      {/* ... other components ... */}
    </Box>
  )
}

export default App
```

### 3. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Chakra UI works well with SSR frameworks like Next.js. You need to ensure that the styles are properly injected into the server-rendered HTML. Refer to the Chakra UI documentation for Next.js setup instructions.
