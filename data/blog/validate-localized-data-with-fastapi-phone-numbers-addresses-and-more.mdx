# Validate Localized Data with FastAPI: Phone Numbers, Addresses & More

Building international applications requires robust data validation that respects regional differences. Simply applying a generic validation rule won't cut it when dealing with localized data like phone numbers, addresses, and even names.  This blog post will guide you through validating localized data in your FastAPI applications, focusing on phone numbers and addresses, and demonstrating best practices for building international-ready APIs.

## Why Localized Data Validation Matters

Incorrect data is a pain.  For international applications, it's a significantly larger pain. Here's why localized data validation is crucial:

*   **Improved Data Quality:** Ensures the data you collect conforms to local standards, reducing errors and improving the overall quality of your database.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:**  By validating data formats at the point of entry, you can provide instant feedback to users, guiding them to provide correct information and improving their overall experience.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:**  Many countries have specific regulations regarding data formats, especially for personal information. Proper validation helps you stay compliant.
*   **Operational Efficiency:**  Clean, validated data streamlines processes, reduces manual correction efforts, and minimizes downstream errors.
*   **Improved Analytics:**  Accurate data leads to better insights and more reliable analytics, empowering you to make informed business decisions.

## Setting up Your FastAPI Project

First, make sure you have FastAPI installed along with Uvicorn (for serving the application).

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

Let's create a basic FastAPI application:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    # We'll add localized validation here later

@app.post("/users/")
async def create_user(user: User):
    # Logic to create a user in the database
    return user
```

## Validating Phone Numbers

Phone number validation is a classic example of localized data validation. The format of a phone number varies dramatically from country to country.  We'll use the `phonenumbers` library for Python, which provides excellent functionality for parsing, formatting, and validating phone numbers.

Install the `phonenumbers` library:

```bash
pip install phonenumbers
```

Now, let's modify our `User` model to include phone number validation:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
import phonenumbers

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    phone_number: str
    country_code: str  # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code

    @validator("phone_number")
    def validate_phone_number(cls, phone_number, values):
        country_code = values.get("country_code")
        if not country_code:
            raise ValueError("Country code is required for phone number validation.")

        try:
            parsed_number = phonenumbers.parse(phone_number, country_code.upper()) # Country codes must be uppercase
            if not phonenumbers.is_valid_number(parsed_number):
                raise ValueError("Invalid phone number for the specified country.")
            return phonenumbers.format_number(parsed_number, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.E164) # Format to E.164
        except phonenumbers.NumberParseException as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid phone number format: {e}")


@app.post("/users/")
async def create_user(user: User):
    # Logic to create a user in the database
    return user
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `phonenumbers`:** We import the necessary library.
2.  **`User` Model:** We add `phone_number` and `country_code` fields.  The `country_code` is crucial for accurately parsing the phone number.  We use the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (e.g., "US", "GB", "DE").
3.  **`@validator("phone_number")`:**  This Pydantic validator runs when the `phone_number` field is being validated.
4.  **`validate_phone_number` Function:**
    *   It retrieves the `country_code` from the `values` dictionary (which contains all the model fields).
    *   It raises a `ValueError` if the `country_code` is missing.  This is essential because `phonenumbers` needs the country code to correctly parse the phone number.
    *   It uses `phonenumbers.parse()` to parse the phone number, providing both the phone number and the country code.  We use `.upper()` to ensure the country code is uppercase as `phonenumbers` expects.
    *   It uses `phonenumbers.is_valid_number()` to check if the parsed number is a valid phone number for the specified country.
    *   If the number is valid, it formats it to the E.164 international standard using `phonenumbers.format_number(..., phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.E164)`.  This ensures consistency in your database.
    *   If any error occurs during parsing (e.g., the phone number is in an invalid format), it catches the `phonenumbers.NumberParseException` and raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message.

**Testing the Phone Number Validation:**

Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Now, you can use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send a POST request to `/users/`.

**Valid Request:**

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "202-456-1111",
    "country_code": "US"
}
```

This will return the same data back, but the `phone_number` will be formatted in E.164 format:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "+12024561111",
    "country_code": "US"
}
```

**Invalid Request (Invalid Phone Number):**

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "12345",
    "country_code": "US"
}
```

This will return an HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity error with a detailed message:

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": [
        "body",
        "phone_number"
      ],
      "msg": "Invalid phone number for the specified country.",
      "type": "value_error"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Invalid Request (Missing Country Code):**

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "202-456-1111"
}
```

This will also return an HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity error:

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": [
        "body",
        "phone_number"
      ],
      "msg": "Country code is required for phone number validation.",
      "type": "value_error"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validating Addresses

Validating addresses is significantly more complex than validating phone numbers. Address formats vary wildly between countries and even within countries.  A complete address validation solution often involves:

*   **Parsing:** Breaking down the address string into its constituent parts (street address, city, state/province, postal code, country).
*   **Standardization:**  Converting the address components to a consistent, standardized format.  For example, changing "St" to "Street" or "Rd" to "Road".
*   **Verification:**  Checking if the address actually exists and is deliverable.  This often involves querying a geocoding service or address validation API.

While building a fully comprehensive address validation solution from scratch is a significant undertaking, we can use libraries to assist us. We'll illustrate a simplified approach using `libpostal` for parsing and standardizing addresses, and then discuss the limitations and considerations for a production environment.

**Important Note:**  `libpostal` is a powerful library, but its installation can be tricky, especially on certain platforms.  It may require compiling from source. Please refer to the official `libpostal` documentation for detailed installation instructions: [https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal)

Install `postal` Python bindings:

```bash
pip install postal
```

**Address Validation Example (Simplified):**

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
import phonenumbers
from postal.parser import parse_address
from postal.normalize import normalize_address

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    phone_number: str
    country_code: str
    address: str

    @validator("phone_number")
    def validate_phone_number(cls, phone_number, values):
        country_code = values.get("country_code")
        if not country_code:
            raise ValueError("Country code is required for phone number validation.")

        try:
            parsed_number = phonenumbers.parse(phone_number, country_code.upper()) # Country codes must be uppercase
            if not phonenumbers.is_valid_number(parsed_number):
                raise ValueError("Invalid phone number for the specified country.")
            return phonenumbers.format_number(parsed_number, phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.E164) # Format to E.164
        except phonenumbers.NumberParseException as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid phone number format: {e}")

    @validator("address")
    def validate_address(cls, address, values):
        try:
            normalized_addresses = normalize_address(address, country=values.get("country_code"))
            if not normalized_addresses:
                raise ValueError("Could not normalize address.")

            parsed_address = parse_address(normalized_addresses[0]) # Take the first normalized address
            if not parsed_address:
                raise ValueError("Could not parse address.")

            # Basic validation: check if street and city are present
            has_street = any(component[1] == 'road' or component[1] == 'house_number' for component in parsed_address)
            has_city = any(component[1] == 'city' for component in parsed_address)

            if not has_street or not has_city:
                raise ValueError("Address is incomplete (missing street or city).")

            # Return the normalized address string for storage
            return normalized_addresses[0]

        except Exception as e:  # Catching a generic exception here, refine as needed
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid address format: {e}")


@app.post("/users/")
async def create_user(user: User):
    # Logic to create a user in the database
    return user
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `postal`:** We import `parse_address` and `normalize_address` from the `postal` library.
2.  **`User` Model:** We add an `address` field.
3.  **`@validator("address")`:**  This Pydantic validator runs when the `address` field is being validated.
4.  **`validate_address` Function:**
    *   **Normalization:**  It uses `normalize_address()` to standardize the address. The `country` parameter is important for better normalization.
    *   **Parsing:** It uses `parse_address()` to break down the normalized address into components.
    *   **Basic Validation:** It checks if the parsed address contains a street (road or house_number) and a city component.  This is a very basic check; more sophisticated validation is needed for production.
    *   **Returns Normalized Address:** If validation passes, it returns the normalized address string.
    *   **Error Handling:**  It catches potential exceptions during normalization and parsing.

**Testing the Address Validation:**

Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn.

**Valid Request:**

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "202-456-1111",
    "country_code": "US",
    "address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA"
}
```

This will normalize the address and return something similar to:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "+12024561111",
    "country_code": "US",
    "address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA",
}
```

**Invalid Request (Missing City):**

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "202-456-1111",
    "country_code": "US",
    "address": "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway"
}
```

This will return a validation error.

**Important Considerations for Address Validation in Production:**

*   **`libpostal` Limitations:** `libpostal` is excellent for parsing and standardization, but it doesn't verify address existence or deliverability. It also requires careful installation and configuration.
*   **Address Validation APIs:**  For production-level address validation, consider using commercial address validation APIs like:
    *   **Google Address Validation API:** [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/overview](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/overview)
    *   **SmartyStreets:** [https://www.smartystreets.com/](https://www.smartystreets.com/)
    *   **Loqate (GBG):** [https://www.loqate.com/](https://www.loqate.com/)
    *   **Melissa Data:** [https://www.melissadata.com/](https://www.melissadata.com/)

    These APIs provide comprehensive address verification, standardization, and geocoding.  They typically have usage-based pricing.
*   **Asynchronous Validation:**  Address validation can be slow, especially when using external APIs. Consider performing validation asynchronously to avoid blocking your main application thread. You can use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` or a task queue like Celery.
*   **Error Handling:**  Handle API errors gracefully.  Address validation APIs can sometimes be unavailable or return errors for various reasons. Implement retry mechanisms and provide informative error messages to the user.
*   **Caching:**  Cache validation results to reduce API calls and improve performance. Be mindful of data privacy regulations when caching.
*   **User Feedback:** Allow users to correct addresses if the validation fails or the API suggests changes. The user might know the correct address even if the API doesn't.
*   **Country-Specific Logic:**  Address formats and validation rules can vary significantly between countries. Consider using country-specific logic to tailor the validation process.
*   **Data Storage:** When storing addresses, store both the original user-entered address and the standardized/validated address.  This allows you to retain the original input while also having a clean, consistent representation for processing.

## Additional Localization Considerations

Beyond phone numbers and addresses, other data points often require localization:

*   **Names:**  Name formats vary across cultures. Some cultures use given name/family name order, while others use different conventions.
*   **Dates and Times:**  Date and time formats are heavily localized. Use libraries like `arrow` or `pendulum` for handling dates and times in a locale-aware manner.
*   **Currencies:** Use libraries like `babel` or `moneyed` to handle currencies and their formatting.
*   **Measurements:**  Consider different units of measurement (e.g., metric vs. imperial).
*   **Text:**  Use proper internationalization (i18n) techniques to support multiple languages in your application.

## Conclusion

Validating localized data is essential for building robust and user-friendly international applications.  By leveraging libraries like `phonenumbers` and `libpostal` (or using commercial address validation APIs), you can significantly improve data quality, enhance the user experience, and ensure compliance with local regulations.  Remember to choose the right validation approach based on your specific needs and budget, and to handle errors gracefully.  By taking the time to properly validate localized data, you'll create a more reliable and globally accessible application.
