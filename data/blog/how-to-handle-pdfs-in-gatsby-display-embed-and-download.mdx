# How to Handle PDFs in Gatsby: Display, Embed, and Download

Gatsby, a popular React-based static site generator, offers incredible performance and flexibility for building modern websites. While it excels at handling HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, working with PDF files requires a slightly different approach. This comprehensive guide explores various methods for effectively handling PDFs in your Gatsby project, covering displaying, embedding, and providing download links.

## Why Handle PDFs in Gatsby?

PDFs are a ubiquitous format for documents, reports, presentations, and more. You might need to incorporate them into your Gatsby site for various reasons:

- **Documentation:** Provide user manuals, API documentation, or tutorials in PDF format.
- **Reports & Data:** Display reports, research papers, or data visualizations stored as PDFs.
- **Forms & Templates:** Offer downloadable forms or templates in PDF format for users to fill out and print.
- **Presentations:** Showcase presentations as interactive or downloadable PDFs.

## Method 1: Simple Download Links

The simplest method is to provide a direct download link to your PDF file. This approach requires minimal setup and is suitable when you primarily want users to download the document rather than view it directly in the browser.

**Steps:**

1.  **Place the PDF in your `static` folder:** Gatsby treats the `static` folder as a publicly accessible directory. Place your PDF files within this folder. For example, create a `pdfs` subdirectory inside `static` to organize your PDF files: `static/pdfs/my-document.pdf`.

2.  **Create a link in your Gatsby component:** Use a standard HTML `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute pointing to the PDF file path within the `static` folder.

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Download our latest report:</p>
      <a href="/pdfs/my-document.pdf" download="my-document.pdf">
        Download Report (PDF)
      </a>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- `/pdfs/my-document.pdf`: This path is relative to the root of your Gatsby site (the `static` folder).
- `download="my-document.pdf"`: The `download` attribute tells the browser to download the file with the specified name. If omitted, the browser might attempt to open the PDF directly.

**Pros:**

- Simple to implement.
- Works without any external libraries.

**Cons:**

- Doesn't allow users to view the PDF within the browser.
- Relies on the browser's built-in PDF viewer (if available).

## Method 2: Embedding PDFs with `react-pdf`

For a more integrated experience, you can embed the PDF directly into your Gatsby page using the `react-pdf` library. This library allows you to render PDFs within a React component, providing more control over the presentation and interaction.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install `react-pdf`:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install react-pdf
    # or
    yarn add react-pdf
    ```

2.  **Import and use the `react-pdf` components:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { Document, Page, pdfjs } from 'react-pdf'
import 'react-pdf/dist/esm/Page/AnnotationLayer.css' //Optional, but recommended

pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjs.version}/pdf.worker.min.js`

const PdfViewer = ({ pdfPath }) => {
  const [numPages, setNumPages] = useState(null)
  const [pageNumber, setPageNumber] = useState(1)

  function onDocumentLoadSuccess({ numPages }) {
    setNumPages(numPages)
  }

  const goToPrevPage = () => setPageNumber(pageNumber > 1 ? pageNumber - 1 : pageNumber)

  const goToNextPage = () => setPageNumber(pageNumber < numPages ? pageNumber + 1 : pageNumber)

  return (
    <div>
      <Document file={pdfPath} onLoadSuccess={onDocumentLoadSuccess}>
        <Page pageNumber={pageNumber} />
      </Document>
      <div>
        <button onClick={goToPrevPage}>Prev</button>
        <span>
          Page {pageNumber || (numPages ? 1 : '--')} of {numPages || '--'}
        </span>
        <button onClick={goToNextPage}>Next</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default PdfViewer
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import { Document, Page, pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';`**: Imports the necessary components from `react-pdf`.
- **`pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = ...`**: This is crucial! `react-pdf` uses Web Workers for PDF rendering. You need to specify the location of the `pdf.worker.min.js` file. Using a CDN like cdnjs is the easiest approach. Alternatively, you can configure webpack to bundle this worker file locally.
- **`Document file={pdfPath} onLoadSuccess={onDocumentLoadSuccess}`**: The `Document` component loads the PDF from the specified `pdfPath`. The `onLoadSuccess` callback is triggered after the PDF is successfully loaded, allowing you to access the number of pages.
- **`Page pageNumber={pageNumber}`**: The `Page` component renders a single page of the PDF, specified by the `pageNumber` prop.
- **State Management (`useState`):** The example utilizes `useState` hooks to manage the current page number and the total number of pages, enabling navigation through the document.
- **Navigation Buttons:** The `goToPrevPage` and `goToNextPage` functions update the `pageNumber` state, allowing users to navigate between pages.

3.  **Use the `PdfViewer` component in your Gatsby page:**

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import PdfViewer from '../components/PdfViewer' // Adjust the path

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Embedded PDF</h1>
      <PdfViewer pdfPath="/pdfs/my-document.pdf" />
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyPage
```

**Important Considerations for `react-pdf`:**

- **Web Workers:** As mentioned above, configuring the Web Worker is essential for `react-pdf` to function correctly. Double-check your configuration if you encounter errors related to `pdf.worker.min.js`.
- **CSS:** The `react-pdf` library includes default styles. You can customize these styles using CSS or by overriding the default CSS classes. The provided import of the AnnotationLayer.css helps clear annotations that are added to pages.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where the PDF fails to load or encounters rendering issues.

**Pros:**

- Allows users to view the PDF directly on the page.
- Provides more control over the PDF's presentation.
- Supports features like page navigation and zoom.

**Cons:**

- Requires installing an external library.
- More complex setup than simple download links.
- Performance can be an issue with large PDFs. Consider lazy loading pages or using a PDF viewer optimized for large documents.

## Method 3: Using an Iframe (Less Recommended)

While not the ideal solution, you can embed a PDF using an `<iframe>` tag. This approach relies on the browser's built-in PDF viewer and may not offer the best user experience or control over the PDF's presentation.

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <iframe src="/pdfs/my-document.pdf" width="800px" height="600px" title="My PDF Document" />
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src="/pdfs/my-document.pdf"`**: Specifies the path to the PDF file.
- **`width` and `height`**: Sets the dimensions of the iframe.
- **`title`**: Provides a title for the iframe, which is important for accessibility.

**Pros:**

- Simple to implement.
- Doesn't require external libraries.

**Cons:**

- Relies on the browser's PDF viewer, which can vary in functionality and appearance.
- Limited control over the PDF's presentation.
- Can be less performant than other methods.
- Potential security risks if the PDF source is untrusted.

**Why is Iframe less recommended?**

- **Security Concerns:** Iframes can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the content within the iframe is untrusted.
- **Performance Issues:** Loading large PDFs within an iframe can impact the overall page performance.
- **Limited Customization:** You have limited control over the appearance and functionality of the PDF viewer within the iframe.

## Method 4: Offering both View and Download Options

The best approach often involves providing users with both options: the ability to view the PDF directly on the page and the option to download it. You can combine the `react-pdf` library for viewing and a download link for downloading.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import PdfViewer from '../components/PdfViewer'

const MyPage = () => {
  const pdfPath = '/pdfs/my-document.pdf'

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>PDF Document</h1>
      <PdfViewer pdfPath={pdfPath} />
      <p>
        <a href={pdfPath} download="my-document.pdf">
          Download PDF
        </a>
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyPage
```

This provides a well-rounded user experience.

## Optimizing PDFs for Gatsby

- **Compress PDFs:** Reduce the file size of your PDFs to improve loading times. Tools like Adobe Acrobat or online PDF compressors can help.
- **Optimize Images:** Ensure that images within your PDFs are optimized for the web.
- **Lazy Loading:** For large PDFs, consider lazy loading pages to improve initial page load performance. `react-pdf` can be used with libraries like `react-lazyload` to achieve this.
- **Accessibility:** Make sure your PDFs are accessible to users with disabilities. Add alt text to images, use proper heading structures, and provide sufficient contrast.

## Conclusion

Handling PDFs in Gatsby requires careful consideration of the user experience and performance. While simple download links are a quick solution, embedding PDFs with `react-pdf` offers a more integrated and customizable experience. By combining both viewing and download options, you can provide users with the flexibility they need. Remember to optimize your PDFs for the web to ensure fast loading times and accessibility. Choose the method that best suits your project's requirements and the needs of your users. Remember to test your PDF implementation thoroughly across different browsers and devices.
