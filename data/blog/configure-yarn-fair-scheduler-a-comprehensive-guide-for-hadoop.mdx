# Configure YARN Fair Scheduler: A Comprehensive Guide for Hadoop

The **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)** framework is a crucial component of Hadoop 2.0 and later, responsible for resource management and job scheduling within the cluster.  One of YARN's key features is its pluggable scheduler, allowing administrators to choose the scheduling algorithm that best suits their needs.  The **Fair Scheduler** is a popular choice, providing a way to dynamically balance resources between multiple users and jobs, preventing resource starvation and improving overall cluster utilization.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to configure the YARN Fair Scheduler, covering its benefits, configuration parameters, and practical examples.

## What is the YARN Fair Scheduler?

The Fair Scheduler aims to allocate cluster resources fairly among all running applications. Instead of queuing applications sequentially, it dynamically distributes resources (CPU and memory) to all applications running in the cluster.  This ensures that no single user or application monopolizes resources, leading to more equitable resource distribution and better overall performance.

**Key Benefits of using the Fair Scheduler:**

*   **Fair Resource Allocation:**  Resources are allocated based on the demand of each running application, preventing resource starvation.
*   **Improved Cluster Utilization:** By dynamically allocating resources, the Fair Scheduler optimizes cluster utilization, reducing idle resources.
*   **Prioritized Job Execution:** Allows prioritizing certain jobs or users by allocating them more resources.
*   **Support for Pools:** Enables grouping users and applications into pools, allowing resource management and fairness within specific groups.
*   **Preemption:**  Allows the scheduler to preempt resources from containers running with lower priority to give them to higher priority containers when resources are constrained.
*   **Queue Management:**  Provides features for creating and managing queues with different configurations and priorities.
*   **Dynamic Queue Creation:** Support for automatic creation of queues based on user or group names.

## Configuration Files for the Fair Scheduler

The Fair Scheduler is configured primarily through two main files:

1.  **`yarn-site.xml`:** This file contains the core YARN configuration parameters.  We'll configure it to enable the Fair Scheduler.
2.  **`fair-scheduler.xml`:** This file defines the queues, their weights, and other scheduling parameters.  This is where the fine-grained control of the scheduler is exercised.

## Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

Here's a step-by-step guide to configuring the YARN Fair Scheduler:

**1. Configure `yarn-site.xml`**

   This file tells YARN to use the Fair Scheduler. Locate your `yarn-site.xml` file (usually in `$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop`). Add or modify the following properties:

   ```xml
   <configuration>
     <property>
       <name>yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.class</name>
       <value>org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.FairScheduler</value>
       <description>The class name of the YARN scheduler.</description>
     </property>

     <property>
       <name>yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file</name>
       <value>/etc/hadoop/fair-scheduler.xml</value>
       <description>Path to the allocation file for the Fair Scheduler.</description>
     </property>

     <property>
       <name>yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption</name>
       <value>true</value>
       <description>Whether to enable preemption of containers by the FairScheduler to satisfy fair sharing.  Default is false</description>
     </property>

   </configuration>
   ```

   **Explanation of properties:**

   *   `yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.class`:  Specifies the class that implements the YARN scheduler.  We set it to `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.fair.FairScheduler` to enable the Fair Scheduler.
   *   `yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file`: Specifies the path to the `fair-scheduler.xml` file, which defines the queue configurations and scheduling policies. **Important:** Change `/etc/hadoop/fair-scheduler.xml` to the actual path of your `fair-scheduler.xml` file.
   *   `yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption`: Enables or disables preemption. Setting it to `true` allows the scheduler to reallocate resources from lower priority containers to higher priority ones, but it can lead to increased overhead due to container restarts.  Evaluate its impact on your workload before enabling.

**2. Create and Configure `fair-scheduler.xml`**

   This file defines the queues and their properties. Create a file named `fair-scheduler.xml` in the location specified in `yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file` (e.g., `/etc/hadoop/`).  Here's a basic example:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <allocations>
     <queue name="root">
       <minResources>1024mb,1vcores</minResources>
       <maxResources>4096mb,4vcores</maxResources>
       <weight>1.0</weight>
       <schedulingPolicy>fair</schedulingPolicy>
     </queue>

     <queue name="developers">
       <minResources>512mb,1vcores</minResources>
       <maxResources>2048mb,2vcores</maxResources>
       <weight>0.5</weight>
       <schedulingPolicy>fair</schedulingPolicy>
     </queue>

     <queue name="research">
       <minResources>512mb,1vcores</minResources>
       <maxResources>2048mb,2vcores</maxResources>
       <weight>0.5</weight>
       <schedulingPolicy>fifo</schedulingPolicy>
     </queue>

     <defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>fair</defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>
   </allocations>
   ```

   **Explanation of Elements:**

   *   `<allocations>`:  The root element of the file.
   *   `<queue name="queue_name">`: Defines a queue with a specific name.  Queues are hierarchical.  The `root` queue is the parent of all other queues, unless specified otherwise.
   *   `<minResources>`: The minimum amount of resources (memory and virtual cores) that the queue is guaranteed to receive. The format is `<memory_in_MB>mb,<vcores>vcores`.
   *   `<maxResources>`: The maximum amount of resources that the queue can use.  The format is `<memory_in_MB>mb,<vcores>vcores`.
   *   `<weight>`:  A relative weight that determines the queue's share of resources compared to other queues.  Higher weights result in a larger share of the cluster resources. In this case, `root` will get twice as many resources compared to `developers` or `research` if they are all fully utilized.
   *   `<schedulingPolicy>`:  The scheduling policy to use for this queue.  Common options include:
        *   `fair`:  Resources are allocated fairly among the running applications within the queue.  (Default)
        *   `fifo`:  Applications are scheduled in a First-In, First-Out order.
        *   `drf`: Dominant Resource Fairness, fairly shares the cluster resources amongst the running applications considering multiple resource types.
   *   `<defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>`: Defines the default scheduling policy for queues that do not explicitly define one.

**3. Queue Hierarchy and Inheritance**

   The Fair Scheduler supports a hierarchical queue structure.  This allows you to organize your applications and users into groups and subgroups, providing more granular control over resource allocation. For instance:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <allocations>
     <queue name="root">
       <minResources>1024mb,1vcores</minResources>
       <maxResources>8192mb,8vcores</maxResources>
       <weight>1.0</weight>
       <schedulingPolicy>fair</schedulingPolicy>

       <queue name="department_a">
         <minResources>512mb,1vcores</minResources>
         <maxResources>4096mb,4vcores</maxResources>
         <weight>0.7</weight>
       </queue>

       <queue name="department_b">
         <minResources>512mb,1vcores</minResources>
         <maxResources>4096mb,4vcores</maxResources>
         <weight>0.3</weight>
       </queue>
     </queue>
     <defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>fair</defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>
   </allocations>
   ```

   In this example, `department_a` and `department_b` are children of the `root` queue.  They inherit the `schedulingPolicy` from their parent, but they have their own defined `minResources`, `maxResources`, and `weight`. The `root` queue has 100% weight, and that is split within department_a and department_b with weights 0.7 and 0.3 respectively.  This will dictate how resources are shared among the department_a and department_b queues.

**4. User and Group Mappings**

   You can configure the Fair Scheduler to automatically place jobs into specific queues based on the user or group that submits the job.  This is done using the `<user>` and `<group>` elements within the `fair-scheduler.xml` file. For instance:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <allocations>
     <queue name="root">
       <minResources>1024mb,1vcores</minResources>
       <maxResources>8192mb,8vcores</maxResources>
       <weight>1.0</weight>
       <schedulingPolicy>fair</schedulingPolicy>
     </queue>

     <queue name="engineering">
       <minResources>512mb,1vcores</minResources>
       <maxResources>4096mb,4vcores</maxResources>
       <weight>0.5</weight>
     </queue>

     <queue name="marketing">
       <minResources>512mb,1vcores</minResources>
       <maxResources>4096mb,4vcores</maxResources>
       <weight>0.5</weight>
     </queue>

     <user name="alice">
       <maxRunningApps>5</maxRunningApps>
     </user>

     <group name="engineers">
       <queue>engineering</queue>
     </group>

     <defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>fair</defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>
   </allocations>
   ```

   In this example:

   *   All jobs submitted by users in the `engineers` group will automatically be placed into the `engineering` queue.
   *   The user `alice` is limited to a maximum of 5 running applications. This limits resource utilization and prevents one user from consuming all available resources.

**5. Dynamic Queue Creation**

   The Fair Scheduler can be configured to automatically create queues based on user or group names.  This eliminates the need to manually define queues for each user or group.  Enable dynamic queue creation in `fair-scheduler.xml` using the `<queuePlacementPolicy>` element:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <allocations>
       <queuePlacementPolicy>
           <rule name="specified" create="false" />
           <rule name="user" create="true" />
           <rule name="default" queue="root" />
       </queuePlacementPolicy>
       <defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>fair</defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>
   </allocations>
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   *   `<queuePlacementPolicy>`:  Defines the rules for placing applications into queues.
   *   `<rule name="specified" create="false" />`: If an application explicitly specifies a queue, use that queue. Do not create a queue if it does not exist.
   *   `<rule name="user" create="true" />`: If the application doesn't specify a queue, create a queue with the same name as the user submitting the application.
   *   `<rule name="default" queue="root" />`: If no other rule applies, place the application in the `root` queue.

**6.  Restart YARN Services**

   After modifying the configuration files, restart the YARN ResourceManager and NodeManager services for the changes to take effect.

   ```bash
   # Restart ResourceManager
   yarn resourcemanager -restart

   # Restart NodeManagers (usually done through your cluster management tool)
   # For example, using Ambari:  Restart the YARN service.
   ```

**7. Monitoring and Tuning**

   After deploying the Fair Scheduler, it's crucial to monitor its performance and tune the configuration as needed.

   *   **YARN Web UI:** The YARN web UI provides a wealth of information about the scheduler, including resource allocation, queue utilization, and application status.  Use this to identify potential bottlenecks and adjust queue configurations accordingly. (Typically accessed at `http://<resource_manager_host>:8088`)
   *   **Metrics:**  Collect and analyze YARN metrics to gain insights into resource usage patterns.  Tools like Ganglia, Prometheus, and Grafana can be used for monitoring and visualization.
   *   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your Fair Scheduler configuration with realistic workloads to ensure it meets your performance and fairness requirements.
   *   **Log Analysis:**  Inspect YARN logs for errors or warnings that may indicate configuration issues.

## Advanced Configuration Options

Beyond the basic configuration, the Fair Scheduler offers a number of advanced options for fine-tuning its behavior:

*   **`yarn.scheduler.fair.max.assign`:**  The maximum number of containers to assign at once in a single scheduling iteration. Adjusting this parameter can impact scheduling latency.
*   **`yarn.scheduler.fair.locality.threshold.node`:** The percentage of resources on a node that must be free before the scheduler will consider scheduling a task on that node if it's not a local task.
*   **`yarn.scheduler.fair.locality.threshold.rack`:** The percentage of resources on a rack that must be free before the scheduler will consider scheduling a task on that rack if it's not a rack-local task.
*   **`yarn.scheduler.fair.sizebasedweight`:** (Deprecated)  Whether to weigh queues based on the number of running applications.
*   **`yarn.scheduler.fair.clusterutilization.threshold`:** The maximum percentage of cluster capacity that the scheduler can utilize.  This helps prevent the cluster from becoming overloaded.

## Example: Configuring for Different Departments with Priorities

Let's say you have three departments: Data Science, Engineering, and Marketing. You want to give Data Science higher priority and guarantee them a minimum amount of resources:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<allocations>
  <queue name="root">
    <minResources>2048mb,2vcores</minResources>
    <maxResources>16384mb,16vcores</maxResources>
    <weight>1.0</weight>
    <schedulingPolicy>fair</schedulingPolicy>

    <queue name="data_science">
      <minResources>1024mb,1vcores</minResources>
      <maxResources>8192mb,8vcores</maxResources>
      <weight>0.6</weight>
    </queue>

    <queue name="engineering">
      <minResources>512mb,0vcores</minResources>
      <maxResources>4096mb,4vcores</maxResources>
      <weight>0.2</weight>
    </queue>

    <queue name="marketing">
      <minResources>512mb,0vcores</minResources>
      <maxResources>4096mb,4vcores</maxResources>
      <weight>0.2</weight>
    </queue>
  </queue>

  <defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>fair</defaultQueueSchedulingPolicy>
</allocations>
```

In this configuration:

*   `data_science` has a higher `weight` (0.6) compared to `engineering` and `marketing` (0.2 each), giving it higher priority.
*   Each queue has its own `minResources` and `maxResources`, ensuring a guaranteed minimum and a maximum limit on resource consumption.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Applications stuck in ACCEPTED state:** This usually indicates that the cluster is under-resourced, or that the queue's `minResources` requirement cannot be met. Check the queue configuration and cluster capacity.
*   **Uneven resource allocation:** Ensure that the weights and scheduling policies are configured correctly to achieve the desired fairness. Monitor queue utilization and adjust the configuration as needed.
*   **Preemption causing performance issues:** If preemption is enabled, excessive container restarts can negatively impact application performance.  Consider disabling preemption or adjusting the `yarn.scheduler.fair.preemption` and related parameters.
*   **Errors in `fair-scheduler.xml`:**  Carefully review the XML file for syntax errors, missing tags, or invalid values. YARN will usually provide helpful error messages in the logs.

## Conclusion

The YARN Fair Scheduler is a powerful tool for managing resources in a Hadoop cluster. By understanding its configuration options and best practices, you can ensure fair resource allocation, improved cluster utilization, and prioritized job execution.  Remember to monitor your cluster's performance and tune the Fair Scheduler configuration as needed to meet your specific requirements.
