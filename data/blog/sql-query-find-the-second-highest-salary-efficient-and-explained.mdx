# SQL Query: Find the Second Highest Salary (Efficient & Explained)

Finding the second highest salary in a database table is a common SQL interview question and a practical task in many data analysis scenarios. This blog post will guide you through several methods to achieve this, explaining the logic behind each approach and providing code examples for various database systems. We'll cover subqueries, `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`, and window functions to equip you with a comprehensive understanding.

## The Problem: Finding the Second Highest Salary

Imagine you have an `Employees` table with columns like `employee_id` and `salary`. Your goal is to write an SQL query that returns the second highest salary in this table. If there isn't a second highest salary (e.g., only one salary or all salaries are the same), the query should ideally return `NULL`.

## Approach 1: Using Subqueries

This approach uses a subquery to find the maximum salary, and then another subquery to find the maximum salary that is *less* than the maximum salary.  This is a classic and understandable method.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees);
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees` (Inner Subquery):** This inner query finds the absolute highest salary in the `Employees` table.

2.  **`WHERE salary < (Inner Subquery)`:** The outer query selects the maximum salary from the `Employees` table, but it filters the results to only include salaries that are *less than* the highest salary found by the inner query.  This effectively finds the second highest.

3.  **`SELECT MAX(salary)` (Outer Query):** The outer query then finds the maximum of these filtered salaries, giving you the second highest salary.

**Handling `NULL` Cases:**

If there's only one distinct salary, the subquery will return the same salary as the inner query.  This will result in the `WHERE` clause filtering out all salaries, and `MAX(salary)` will return `NULL`. This is the desired behavior.

**Example (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 50000.00),
(2, 60000.00),
(3, 70000.00),
(4, 60000.00),
(5, 80000.00);


SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees); -- Returns 70000.00


INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (6, 80000.00);

SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees); -- Returns 70000.00


DELETE FROM Employees;
INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (1, 50000);

SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees); -- Returns NULL
```

## Approach 2: Using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` (or `ROWNUM` in Oracle)

This approach leverages the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses (or the equivalent in Oracle) to select the second row after sorting the salaries in descending order.  This is often more efficient than using subqueries, especially in large tables.

**Standard SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite):**

```sql
SELECT salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ORDER BY salary DESC`:** This sorts the salaries in descending order, so the highest salary is at the top.

2.  **`LIMIT 1`:** This limits the result set to only one row.

3.  **`OFFSET 1`:** This skips the first row (the highest salary), effectively selecting the second row.

**Handling `NULL` Cases:**

If there are fewer than two distinct salaries, this query will return an empty result set, which is often treated as `NULL` by database clients.

**Oracle (Using `ROWNUM`):**

Oracle doesn't directly support `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`. You'll need to use `ROWNUM` within a subquery:

```sql
SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary, ROWNUM as rn
    FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM Employees
        ORDER BY salary DESC
    )
    WHERE ROWNUM <= 2
)
WHERE rn = 2;
```

**Explanation (Oracle):**

1. **`SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC`:** This inner-most query selects all distinct salaries and sorts them in descending order.
2. **`SELECT salary, ROWNUM as rn FROM (...) WHERE ROWNUM <= 2`:** This query assigns a row number (`ROWNUM`) to each distinct salary and filters the result set to the top 2 rows. `ROWNUM` assignment happens *before* ordering in Oracle without the inner subquery, which is why we need it.
3. **`SELECT salary FROM (...) WHERE rn = 2`:**  Finally, this query selects the salary from the row where `ROWNUM` is 2, which represents the second highest salary.

**Example (MySQL):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 50000.00),
(2, 60000.00),
(3, 70000.00),
(4, 60000.00),
(5, 80000.00);

SELECT salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1; -- Returns 70000.00

INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (6, 80000.00);

SELECT salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1; -- Returns 70000.00

DELETE FROM Employees;
INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (1, 50000);

SELECT salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1; -- Returns NULL (No rows returned)
```

**Important Note:**

The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` method assumes that `salary` is unique, if there are more than one rows with the same salary, then this method is not correct. `DISTINCT` can be used inside the query to get the unique salaries before applying `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

```sql
SELECT salary
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC) as distinct_salaries
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

This addresses the edge case where duplicate salaries might skew the result.

## Approach 3: Using Window Functions (RANK or DENSE_RANK)

Window functions provide a powerful way to rank rows within a partition (or the entire table in this case).  `RANK()` assigns a rank to each row based on its salary, while `DENSE_RANK()` assigns consecutive ranks without gaps, even if there are ties in salary.

**SQL Standard (MySQL 8.0+, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle):**

```sql
SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM Employees
) AS ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)`:** This calculates the dense rank of each salary based on its value. The `OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)` clause specifies that the ranking should be done based on the `salary` column in descending order.  `DENSE_RANK()` ensures that ranks are consecutive, even if multiple employees have the same salary.

2.  **`SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() ... FROM Employees`:** This creates a derived table (or subquery) called `ranked_salaries` that includes the salary and its corresponding rank.

3.  **`SELECT salary FROM ranked_salaries WHERE salary_rank = 2`:** The outer query then selects the salary from the `ranked_salaries` table where the `salary_rank` is equal to 2, effectively retrieving the second highest salary.

**Handling `NULL` Cases:**

If there is no second highest salary, the `WHERE salary_rank = 2` clause will filter out all rows, and the query will return an empty result set, which can be interpreted as `NULL`.  If you want to *explicitly* return `NULL`, you can use a `CASE` statement:

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN NULL
        ELSE (SELECT salary FROM (
                  SELECT salary,
                         DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
                  FROM Employees
              ) AS ranked_salaries WHERE salary_rank = 2 LIMIT 1)
    END
FROM Employees;
```

**Example (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 50000.00),
(2, 60000.00),
(3, 70000.00),
(4, 60000.00),
(5, 80000.00);

SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM Employees
) AS ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2; -- Returns 70000.00


INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (6, 80000.00);

SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM Employees
) AS ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2; -- Returns 70000.00

DELETE FROM Employees;
INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, salary) VALUES (1, 50000);


SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM Employees
) AS ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2; -- Returns NULL (No rows returned)
```

**Why use `DENSE_RANK()` over `RANK()`?**

If you have multiple employees with the same salary, `RANK()` will skip ranks. For example, if two employees have the highest salary, they both get rank 1, and the next highest salary will get rank 3.  `DENSE_RANK()` avoids this, assigning consecutive ranks (1, 1, 2). Therefore, `DENSE_RANK()` is generally preferred for finding the *second distinct* highest salary.

## Performance Considerations

*   **Subqueries:** While easy to understand, subqueries can sometimes be less efficient, especially in large tables. The database might need to scan the table multiple times.

*   **`LIMIT` and `OFFSET`:**  This approach can be very efficient, especially when combined with an index on the `salary` column.  However, the performance can degrade as the offset increases.

*   **Window Functions:** Window functions often provide good performance because the database can optimize the ranking process. They can be especially efficient if the database supports window function optimization.

Generally, `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` or window functions are preferred over subqueries for performance reasons, especially with large datasets. Always test the performance of your queries on your specific database and data to determine the most efficient approach.

## Choosing the Right Approach

*   **Readability:** Subqueries are often the easiest to understand for beginners.
*   **Performance:**  `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` (or their equivalents) and window functions are often more efficient for large tables.
*   **Database Support:** Ensure that the chosen method is supported by your specific database system.
