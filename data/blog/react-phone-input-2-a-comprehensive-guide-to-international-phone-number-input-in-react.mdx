# React Phone Input 2: A Comprehensive Guide to International Phone Number Input in React

Collecting phone numbers in web applications is a common requirement, especially when dealing with user registration, contact forms, or any service that requires verification. However, handling international phone numbers correctly can be tricky.  This is where the `react-phone-input-2` package comes to the rescue.  It provides a user-friendly and robust solution for handling international phone number input within your React applications.  This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from basic installation and usage to advanced customization and integration with popular form libraries.

## What is `react-phone-input-2`?

`react-phone-input-2` is a React component that provides a stylish and feature-rich international phone number input field.  It offers several key features:

*   **Internationalization:**  Supports a vast range of countries with automatic country code detection and flag display.
*   **Validation:**  Provides built-in validation to ensure users enter valid phone numbers based on the selected country.
*   **Customization:**  Highly customizable with options to modify the styling, flags, and behavior to fit your application's design.
*   **Accessibility:**  Designed with accessibility in mind, providing a good user experience for everyone.
*   **Lightweight:**  Has a small footprint and doesn't add unnecessary bloat to your application.

## Getting Started: Installation

The first step is to install the `react-phone-input-2` package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-phone-input-2
# or
yarn add react-phone-input-2
```

## Basic Usage

Now that you have installed the package, let's implement a simple example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PhoneInput from 'react-phone-input-2';
import 'react-phone-input-2/lib/style.css'; // Import the styles!

function App() {
  const [phone, setPhone] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <PhoneInput
        country={'us'}  // Default country
        value={phone}
        onChange={phone => setPhone(phone)}
      />
      <p>Phone number: {phone}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Import Necessary Modules:** We import the `PhoneInput` component from `react-phone-input-2` and the CSS styles for the component.  **Important:** Remember to import the CSS, or the component will look unstyled.
*   **State Management:**  We use the `useState` hook to manage the phone number entered by the user.  The `phone` state variable holds the phone number, and `setPhone` is used to update the state.
*   **Rendering the Component:**  We render the `PhoneInput` component and pass the following props:
    *   `country`: Sets the default country to `us` (United States).  You can set this to any country code (e.g., `gb` for United Kingdom, `ca` for Canada).
    *   `value`:  Binds the phone number state variable (`phone`) to the input field.
    *   `onChange`:  A function that is called whenever the phone number changes.  We update the state variable `phone` with the new phone number value.
*   **Displaying the Phone Number:** We display the current phone number below the input field.

This basic example will render a phone number input field with a country code dropdown and flag display. The default country is set to the United States.

## Advanced Customization

The `react-phone-input-2` component provides a wide range of customization options to tailor the component to your specific needs. Let's explore some of the most useful ones.

### 1.  Country Code Preference

You can specify a preference order for displaying countries in the dropdown using the `preferredCountries` prop:

```jsx
<PhoneInput
  country={'us'}
  preferredCountries={['us', 'gb', 'ca']}
  value={phone}
  onChange={phone => setPhone(phone)}
/>
```

This will display United States, Great Britain, and Canada at the top of the dropdown list.

### 2.  Disable Country Code Change

If you want to prevent users from changing the country code, you can use the `disableCountryCode` prop:

```jsx
<PhoneInput
  country={'us'}
  disableCountryCode
  value={phone}
  onChange={phone => setPhone(phone)}
/>
```

This will hide the country code dropdown and prevent users from selecting a different country.  The flag will still be visible.

### 3.  Disable Area Codes

In some cases, you might want to disable the display of area codes in the input field. You can achieve this using the `disableAreaCodes` prop:

```jsx
<PhoneInput
  country={'us'}
  disableAreaCodes
  value={phone}
  onChange={phone => setPhone(phone)}
/>
```

### 4.  Changing the Placeholder

The `placeholder` prop allows you to customize the placeholder text in the input field:

```jsx
<PhoneInput
  country={'us'}
  placeholder="Enter your phone number"
  value={phone}
  onChange={phone => setPhone(phone)}
/>
```

### 5.  Custom Styling

You can customize the styling of the component using CSS classes or inline styles. The package provides various CSS classes that you can target. For example:

```jsx
<PhoneInput
  country={'us'}
  value={phone}
  onChange={phone => setPhone(phone)}
  inputStyle={{ width: '100%', borderColor: 'red' }} // Inline styling
  buttonStyle={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}} // Styling the country select button
  dropdownStyle={{backgroundColor: 'lightgreen'}} // Styling the dropdown
/>
```

You can also override the default CSS classes by providing your own styles in your CSS file or using a CSS-in-JS solution like Styled Components.

### 6.  Formatting the Phone Number

You can control how the phone number is formatted using the `enableAreaCodeStretch` and other formatting-related props.  Refer to the package documentation for a complete list.

### 7.  Disable Dropdown

If you don't need the country dropdown at all, you can disable it completely:

```jsx
<PhoneInput
  country={'us'}
  disableDropdown
  value={phone}
  onChange={phone => setPhone(phone)}
/>
```

This will only show the input field with the selected country's flag.

## Validation

`react-phone-input-2` doesn't inherently provide real-time validation of *every* possible number. However, it does provide the country code selection, which is crucial for determining the number format. To get robust validation you'll need to integrate with a validation library like `libphonenumber-js`.

Here's how to integrate `libphonenumber-js` for validation:

1. **Install libphonenumber-js:**

   ```bash
   npm install libphonenumber-js
   # or
   yarn add libphonenumber-js
   ```

2. **Implement Validation Logic:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PhoneInput from 'react-phone-input-2';
import 'react-phone-input-2/lib/style.css';
import { isValidPhoneNumber } from 'libphonenumber-js';

function App() {
  const [phone, setPhone] = useState('');
  const [isValid, setIsValid] = useState(true); // Initially assume valid

  const handlePhoneChange = (value, countryData) => {
    setPhone(value);
    const isValid = isValidPhoneNumber(value, countryData.countryCode.toUpperCase());
    setIsValid(isValid);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <PhoneInput
        country={'us'}
        value={phone}
        onChange={handlePhoneChange}
        isValid={isValid} // Pass the validation state
      />
      {!isValid && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>Invalid Phone Number</p>}
      <p>Phone number: {phone}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Import `isValidPhoneNumber`:** We import the `isValidPhoneNumber` function from `libphonenumber-js`.
*   **Validation Logic:**
    *   Inside `handlePhoneChange`, we call `isValidPhoneNumber` with the entered phone number (`value`) and the country code (obtained from `countryData.countryCode.toUpperCase()`). The library expects the country code in uppercase.
    *   We update the `isValid` state variable based on the validation result.
*   **Displaying Validation Error:**  We conditionally render an error message if the phone number is invalid.  Remember to style the error message appropriately.
*   **Passing `isValid` prop (Optional but Recommended):**  You *can* pass the `isValid` state as a prop to `PhoneInput` itself (`isValid={isValid}`).  This is helpful for visually indicating the valid/invalid state on the component itself (e.g., changing the border color).  However, you will need to add custom CSS to style the input field based on the `isValid` prop. See the example below for how to do this.

**Custom Styling Based on Validation (Important!)**

To visually indicate validation status directly in the `PhoneInput` component, you'll need to use CSS.  Here's an example using inline styles:

```jsx
<PhoneInput
  country={'us'}
  value={phone}
  onChange={handlePhoneChange}
  inputStyle={{
    borderColor: isValid ? 'green' : 'red',
  }}
/>
```

This will change the border color of the input field to green if the phone number is valid and red if it's invalid. You can use CSS classes for more complex styling.

**Important Considerations for Validation:**

*   **As-You-Type Formatting:** The `react-phone-input-2` library provides basic formatting as you type, but it's not perfect.  `libphonenumber-js` is more accurate for determining validity.
*   **Country Code is Key:**  The country code is essential for accurate validation.  Make sure the component is configured correctly to handle different country codes.
*   **Real-time vs. Submit-Time Validation:** You can choose to validate the phone number in real-time (as the user types) or only when the form is submitted.  Real-time validation provides a better user experience.  Submit-time validation is typically used for backend validation.
*   **Backend Validation:**  Always validate the phone number on the backend to prevent malicious attacks and ensure data integrity.  Use `libphonenumber-js` or a similar library on your backend.

## Integration with Formik and Yup

For more complex forms, it's best to integrate `react-phone-input-2` with form management libraries like Formik and validation libraries like Yup.

1.  **Install Formik and Yup:**

    ```bash
    npm install formik yup
    # or
    yarn add formik yup
    ```

2.  **Implement Formik and Yup Integration:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFormik } from 'formik';
import * as Yup from 'yup';
import PhoneInput from 'react-phone-input-2';
import 'react-phone-input-2/lib/style.css';
import { isValidPhoneNumber } from 'libphonenumber-js';

const validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  phone: Yup.string()
    .required('Phone number is required')
    .test(
      'is-valid-phone',
      'Invalid phone number',
      (value) => {
        if (!value) return false; // If value is empty, it's caught by .required()
        return isValidPhoneNumber(value); // Uses libphonenumber-js for validation
      }
    ),
});

function App() {
  const formik = useFormik({
    initialValues: {
      phone: '',
    },
    validationSchema: validationSchema,
    onSubmit: (values) => {
      alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));
    },
  });

  return (
    <form onSubmit={formik.handleSubmit}>
      <PhoneInput
        country={'us'}
        value={formik.values.phone}
        onChange={(value) => formik.setFieldValue('phone', value)}
        onBlur={formik.handleBlur} // Handle blur for touched status
        name="phone" // Important: set the name prop to match Formik's field name
      />
      {formik.touched.phone && formik.errors.phone ? (
        <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>{formik.errors.phone}</div>
      ) : null}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Install Dependencies:** We import `useFormik` from Formik and `Yup` for validation schemas, along with `PhoneInput` and `isValidPhoneNumber`.
*   **Yup Validation Schema:** We define a Yup validation schema for the `phone` field:
    *   `.required()`:  Ensures that the phone number is required.
    *   `.test()`:  Uses a custom test function to validate the phone number using `isValidPhoneNumber` from `libphonenumber-js`.
    *   The custom test function first checks if the value is empty. If it's empty, the `.required()` validator will handle it. If the value is not empty, it calls `isValidPhoneNumber` to validate the phone number.
*   **Formik Hook:** We use the `useFormik` hook to manage the form state, validation, and submission.
*   **`initialValues`:** Sets the initial value of the `phone` field to an empty string.
*   **`validationSchema`:**  Specifies the Yup validation schema to use for validation.
*   **`onSubmit`:**  A function that is called when the form is submitted.  It displays the form values in an alert.
*   **Integrating `PhoneInput` with Formik:**
    *   `value={formik.values.phone}`: Binds the `PhoneInput` component to the Formik state for the `phone` field.
    *   `onChange={(value) => formik.setFieldValue('phone', value)}`:  Updates the Formik state whenever the phone number changes.  Crucially, we use `formik.setFieldValue` to update Formik's state.
    *   `onBlur={formik.handleBlur}`: Handles the blur event to update the `touched` status for the `phone` field. This allows Formik to track whether the user has interacted with the field.
    *   `name="phone"`:  **Critical!** Sets the `name` prop of the `PhoneInput` to the same name as the field in your Formik state (`"phone"`).  This is how Formik knows which field to associate the input with.
*   **Displaying Validation Errors:**  We conditionally render an error message if the `phone` field has been touched and has errors.

**Key Considerations for Formik and Yup Integration:**

*   **`setFieldValue` is Essential:**  Always use `formik.setFieldValue` to update Formik's state when the `PhoneInput` value changes.
*   **`name` Prop is Crucial:** Set the `name` prop on the `PhoneInput` component to match the corresponding field name in your Formik state.
*   **`onBlur` for Touched Status:**  Include the `onBlur` handler to properly track the touched status of the field, which is necessary for displaying validation errors.
*   **Custom Validation Logic:**  The custom validation logic within the Yup schema allows you to use `libphonenumber-js` (or another validation library) for robust phone number validation.
*   **Backend Validation:**  Always validate the phone number on the backend for security and data integrity.
