# OAuth2 vs JWT in Spring Security: Deep Dive and Practical Examples

Spring Security offers powerful mechanisms for securing your applications, and two prominent technologies within this ecosystem are OAuth2 and JWT (JSON Web Token). While often used together, they serve different purposes and understanding their distinctions is crucial for building secure and scalable systems. This blog post provides a detailed comparison of OAuth2 and JWT within the context of Spring Security, including practical code examples.

## What is OAuth2?

OAuth2 (Open Authorization) is an authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service on behalf of a resource owner. It allows users to grant access to their resources (data, profiles, etc.) hosted on one service to another application _without_ sharing their credentials (username and password).

**Key Concepts in OAuth2:**

- **Resource Owner:** The entity that owns the protected resources (e.g., a user).
- **Client:** The application requesting access to the resource owner's resources (e.g., a third-party application).
- **Authorization Server:** Issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining their consent.
- **Resource Server:** Hosts the protected resources and validates the access token presented by the client.
- **Access Token:** A credential that grants the client limited access to the resource owner's resources. It has a limited scope and lifespan.
- **Authorization Grant:** A credential representing the resource owner's authorization (e.g., authorization code, implicit grant, password grant, client credentials).

**OAuth2 Flows (Simplified):**

OAuth2 defines several flows tailored to different use cases. The most common are:

- **Authorization Code Grant:** The most secure and recommended flow for web applications. It involves redirecting the user to the authorization server, which issues an authorization code. The client then exchanges the code for an access token.
- **Implicit Grant:** Suitable for single-page applications (SPAs) where the client cannot securely store secrets. The access token is directly returned to the client upon user authorization.
- **Password Grant:** The client directly requests an access token using the resource owner's credentials. **This flow is generally discouraged** because it requires the client to handle the resource owner's credentials, increasing the risk of security breaches.
- **Client Credentials Grant:** Used for machine-to-machine authentication where the client authenticates itself using its own credentials.

## What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. These claims can be about the user (authentication), their permissions (authorization), or any other relevant information. JWTs are digitally signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair (with RSA or ECDSA).

**Key Components of a JWT:**

A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.):

- **Header:** Contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing and the token type (JWT).
- **Payload:** Contains the claims, which are statements about the user or the data being transmitted. Claims can be registered claims (e.g., `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`), public claims (registered in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry), or private claims (custom claims).
- **Signature:** Calculated using the header, the payload, and the secret key (or private key). The signature verifies the integrity of the token and ensures that it hasn't been tampered with.

**Example JWT (decoded):**

```plaintext
{
  "header": {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  },
  "payload": {
    "sub": "user123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "roles": ["ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN"],
    "iss": "my-auth-server",
    "exp": 1672531200
  },
  "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMTIzIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwicm9sZXMiOlsiUk9MRV9VU0VSIiwiUk9MRV9BRE1JTiJdLCJpc3MiOiJteS1hdXRoLXNlcnZlciIsImV4cCI6MTY3MjUzMTIwMH0.signature"
}
```

## How They Work Together in Spring Security

In Spring Security, OAuth2 and JWT are often used in conjunction. The OAuth2 authorization server issues access tokens, and those access tokens can be JWTs. This allows the resource server to easily verify the authenticity and authorization of the client by validating the JWT's signature and claims.

**Typical Workflow:**

1.  The client requests an access token from the authorization server (using an OAuth2 flow).
2.  The authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains their consent (if required).
3.  The authorization server issues a JWT as the access token.
4.  The client presents the JWT to the resource server when accessing protected resources.
5.  The resource server validates the JWT's signature and claims (e.g., expiration time, issuer, audience, roles).
6.  If the JWT is valid and the client has the necessary permissions, the resource server grants access to the requested resources.

## Spring Security Implementation: Code Examples

Let's illustrate how to implement OAuth2 and JWT in Spring Security with Spring Boot.

**1. Setting up the Authorization Server (using Spring Authorization Server):**

First, you'll need to add the Spring Authorization Server dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```plaintext
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

**Configuration:**

```plaintext
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.core.Ordered;
import org.springframework.core.annotation.Order;
import org.springframework.security.config.Customizer;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfiguration;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.AuthorizationGrantType;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.ClientAuthenticationMethod;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.OidcScopes;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.authorization.client.InMemoryRegisteredClientRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.authorization.client.RegisteredClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.authorization.client.RegisteredClientRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.authorization.config.ProviderSettings;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

import java.util.UUID;

@Configuration
public class AuthorizationServerConfig {

    @Bean
    @Order(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)
    public SecurityFilterChain authorizationServerSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfiguration.applyDefaultSecurity(http);
        return http.formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults()).build();
    }

    @Bean
    public RegisteredClientRepository registeredClientRepository() {
        RegisteredClient registeredClient = RegisteredClient.withId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                .clientId("client-id")
                .clientSecret("{noop}secret") // Use BCryptPasswordEncoder in production
                .clientAuthenticationMethod(ClientAuthenticationMethod.CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC)
                .authorizationGrantType(AuthorizationGrantType.AUTHORIZATION_CODE)
                .authorizationGrantType(AuthorizationGrantType.REFRESH_TOKEN)
                .redirectUri("http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/custom")
                .scope(OidcScopes.OPENID)
                .scope("read")
                .build();

        return new InMemoryRegisteredClientRepository(registeredClient);
    }

    @Bean
    public ProviderSettings providerSettings() {
        return ProviderSettings.builder().issuer("http://auth-server:9000").build();
    }

}
```

**Explanation:**

- `authorizationServerSecurityFilterChain`: Configures the security filter chain for the authorization server. `OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfiguration.applyDefaultSecurity(http)` sets up the standard OAuth2 endpoints.
- `registeredClientRepository`: Registers the OAuth2 client. You would typically store client details in a database in a real-world application.
  - `clientId`: The client's unique identifier.
  - `clientSecret`: The client's secret key (use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` for secure password storage in production). The `{noop}` prefix disables password encoding. **Never store secrets in plain text in production.**
  - `clientAuthenticationMethod`: The method used to authenticate the client (e.g., `CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC`).
  - `authorizationGrantType`: The OAuth2 flow supported by the client (e.g., `AUTHORIZATION_CODE`, `REFRESH_TOKEN`).
  - `redirectUri`: The URI where the authorization server will redirect the user after authorization.
  - `scope`: The permissions the client is requesting (e.g., `openid`, `read`).
- `providerSettings`: Configures settings for the authorization server, such as the issuer URI.

**2. Setting up the Resource Server:**

Add the necessary dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```plaintext
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Configuration:**

```plaintext
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

import static org.springframework.security.config.Customizer.withDefaults;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class ResourceServerConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -> authz
                .requestMatchers("/api/**").authenticated()
                .anyRequest().permitAll()
            )
            .oauth2ResourceServer((oauth2) -> oauth2.jwt(withDefaults()));
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `@EnableWebSecurity`: Enables Spring Security's web security features.
- `filterChain`: Configures the security filter chain for the resource server.
  - `.requestMatchers("/api/**").authenticated()`: Requires authentication for any request to `/api/**`.
  - `.oauth2ResourceServer((oauth2) -> oauth2.jwt(withDefaults()))`: Configures the resource server to validate JWTs. `withDefaults()` uses the default JWT configuration.

**3. Creating a Controller (Protected Resource):**

```plaintext
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class ApiController {

    @GetMapping("/api/resource")
    public String getResource() {
        return "Protected Resource Accessed Successfully!";
    }
}
```

**4. Configure application.properties:**

```properties
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://auth-server:9000
#or
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=http://auth-server:9000/oauth2/jwks
```

**Explanation:**

- `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri`: Configures the issuer URI of the JWT provider. The resource server uses this to validate the `iss` claim in the JWT. Alternatively, you can point directly to the `jwks` endpoint.

**Testing the Setup:**

1.  Start both the Authorization Server and the Resource Server applications.
2.  Request an authorization code from the Authorization Server's `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint (e.g., using Postman or a browser).
3.  Exchange the authorization code for an access token using the Authorization Server's `/oauth2/token` endpoint.
4.  Send a request to the Resource Server's `/api/resource` endpoint, including the access token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`).
5.  If the access token is valid, the Resource Server will return the protected resource.

## Choosing Between OAuth2 and JWT

- **Use OAuth2 when:** You need to delegate access to resources on behalf of a user to a third-party application. It's ideal for scenarios where users want to grant limited access to their data without sharing their credentials.
- **Use JWT when:** You need a compact and self-contained way to represent claims and securely transmit information between parties. JWTs are well-suited for authentication, authorization, and session management.
- **Use both when:** You need a robust and secure system. OAuth2 can be used to issue JWT access tokens, which can then be used to authenticate and authorize clients accessing protected resources.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**OAuth2 Advantages:**

- **Delegation of Access:** Allows users to grant limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials.
- **Standardized Framework:** Widely adopted and supported across various platforms and programming languages.
- **Centralized Authorization:** Provides a centralized point for managing authorization policies.

**OAuth2 Disadvantages:**

- **Complexity:** Can be more complex to implement than simpler authentication mechanisms.
- **Network Dependency:** Requires communication with the authorization server to obtain and validate access tokens (although this is reduced when using JWTs as access tokens).

**JWT Advantages:**

- **Compact and Self-Contained:** JWTs are small and contain all the necessary information for authentication and authorization.
- **Stateless:** The resource server doesn't need to contact the authorization server for every request, as the JWT contains the necessary claims.
- **Scalable:** JWTs can be easily distributed across multiple servers without requiring shared session storage.

**JWT Disadvantages:**

- **Token Size:** Can be larger than opaque tokens, especially with many claims.
- **Revocation Challenges:** Revoking a JWT is difficult once it's issued (short expiration times and refresh tokens are common solutions).
- **Secret Management:** Requires careful management of the secret key used to sign the JWT.

## Conclusion

OAuth2 and JWT are powerful tools for securing your Spring Security applications. Understanding their differences and how they can be used together is crucial for building robust, scalable, and secure systems. By carefully considering your specific requirements, you can choose the right approach to protect your resources and provide a seamless user experience. Remember to always prioritize security best practices when implementing these technologies, such as using strong passwords, encrypting sensitive data, and regularly rotating secrets.
