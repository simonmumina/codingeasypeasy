# Validate Full-Width Characters in Input Fields with Express-Validator

In modern web application development, robust input validation is paramount.  Protecting your backend from malicious or malformed data is crucial for security and data integrity.  One common validation scenario involves ensuring that an input field contains only full-width characters. This is especially important when dealing with languages like Japanese, Chinese, and Korean (CJK), where full-width characters are the norm.

This blog post will guide you through the process of validating whether an input field contains only full-width characters using the powerful Express-Validator middleware for Node.js.  We'll cover the necessary setup, the implementation of a custom validator, and provide practical code examples to help you implement this validation in your own projects.

## Why Validate Full-Width Characters?

You might be wondering why validating full-width characters is necessary. Here are a few key reasons:

*   **Data Consistency:** Ensuring consistency in data representation. If you're expecting a field to contain only full-width characters, validating this constraint ensures that your data conforms to your requirements.

*   **Security:** Preventing injection attacks. While not a direct vulnerability, inconsistent character encodings can sometimes be exploited in certain contexts.  Validating the character width can help prevent unexpected behavior.

*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Correctly handling and displaying text in different languages.  When dealing with CJK languages, using the correct character width is essential for proper rendering and user experience.

*   **Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with systems that expect specific character encodings and widths.

## Setting Up Your Project

Before we dive into the code, let's set up a basic Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Initialize a new Node.js project:**

    ```bash
    mkdir express-validator-example
    cd express-validator-example
    npm init -y
    ```

2.  **Install Express and Express-Validator:**

    ```bash
    npm install express express-validator
    ```

## Implementing the Full-Width Character Validator

Express-Validator provides a flexible way to create custom validators. We'll leverage this feature to implement our full-width character validation logic.

First, let's create a utility function that checks if a given string contains only full-width characters.  We'll use a regular expression for this purpose.

```javascript
// utils/isFullWidth.js
function isFullWidth(str) {
  if (typeof str !== 'string') {
    return false; // Return false if not a string
  }
  return /[\uFF01-\uFF5E\u3000-\u303F]/.test(str) && !/[^\uFF01-\uFF5E\u3000-\u303F]/.test(str);
}

module.exports = isFullWidth;
```

**Explanation:**

*   `typeof str !== 'string'`: This checks if the input is a string. If it's not, it immediately returns `false`.  This prevents unexpected errors if a non-string value is passed to the function.

*   `/[\uFF01-\uFF5E\u3000-\u303F]/.test(str)`: This regular expression tests if the string contains **at least one** full-width character. The Unicode ranges `\uFF01-\uFF5E` and `\u3000-\u303F` cover common full-width characters used in CJK languages.

*   `!/[^\uFF01-\uFF5E\u3000-\u303F]/.test(str)`: This regular expression tests if the string contains **any character that is NOT a full-width character**.  The `^` inside the square brackets means "not".  The `!` negates the result, so the entire expression returns `true` only if the string contains *only* full-width characters.

Now, let's integrate this utility function with Express-Validator.

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
const isFullWidth = require('./utils/isFullWidth');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // For parsing form data

app.post('/submit',
  // Validation middleware
  body('fullName')
    .notEmpty()
    .withMessage('Full name is required')
    .custom(value => {
      if (!isFullWidth(value)) {
        throw new Error('Full name must contain only full-width characters.');
      }
      return true; // Indicate success
    }),
  (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }

    // Process the valid data
    const fullName = req.body.fullName;
    console.log('Received full name:', fullName);
    res.send('Form submitted successfully!');
  }
);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    <form action="/submit" method="post">
      <label for="fullName">Full Name (Full-Width Characters Only):</label>
      <input type="text" id="fullName" name="fullName"><br><br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
  `);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** We import `express`, `body` and `validationResult` from `express-validator`, and our custom `isFullWidth` function.

2.  **Create an Express app:**  We initialize the Express application.

3.  **Middleware Setup:** `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`  This is crucial for parsing data submitted through HTML forms.  Without it, `req.body` will be empty.

4.  **Route Definition (`/submit`):** This route handles the form submission.

    *   **Validation Middleware:**  `body('fullName')...` This is where the Express-Validator magic happens.
        *   `body('fullName')`:  Specifies that we're validating the `fullName` field in the request body.
        *   `.notEmpty().withMessage('Full name is required')`: Ensures that the field is not empty.
        *   `.custom(value => { ... })`:  This is where we use our custom validator.
            *   The `value` argument contains the value of the `fullName` field.
            *   `if (!isFullWidth(value)) { ... }`:  We call our `isFullWidth` function to check if the value contains only full-width characters.
            *   `throw new Error('Full name must contain only full-width characters.');`:  If the validation fails, we throw an error with a descriptive message.  This message will be included in the validation errors returned by Express-Validator.
            *   `return true;`:  If the validation passes, we explicitly return `true`. This is important to tell Express-Validator that the validation was successful.
    *   **Error Handling:**
        *   `const errors = validationResult(req);`:  `validationResult` collects any validation errors that occurred during the validation process.
        *   `if (!errors.isEmpty()) { ... }`:  If there are any errors, we send a 400 (Bad Request) response with the error details in JSON format.
    *   **Successful Submission:** If there are no validation errors, we process the data and send a success response.

5.  **Basic Form (`/`):**  A simple HTML form is provided at the root route to allow users to submit data.

6.  **Start the server:**  The server listens on port 3000.

## Running the Example

1.  Save the above code as `server.js` and the utility function as `utils/isFullWidth.js`.
2.  Run the server: `node server.js`
3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
4.  Enter a full name with only full-width characters (e.g., 太郎 山田) and submit the form.
5.  Try submitting a name with a mix of full-width and half-width characters (e.g., 太郎Yamada). You should see a validation error.

## Best Practices and Considerations

*   **Error Messages:** Provide clear and informative error messages to guide the user.
*   **Unicode Ranges:**  Adjust the Unicode ranges in the regular expression if you need to support a different set of full-width characters. Refer to Unicode documentation for accurate ranges.
*   **Client-Side Validation:** Consider adding client-side validation using JavaScript for a better user experience.  However, **never rely solely on client-side validation**.  Always perform server-side validation for security.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** If your application supports multiple languages, make sure your validation logic is locale-aware and handles character encoding correctly.
