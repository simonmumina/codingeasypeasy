# How to Change Apache Port from 80 to Another Port (Step-by-Step Guide)

The default port for HTTP traffic is port 80. While widely used, it's sometimes necessary or desirable to change Apache's listening port to something else. This might be to avoid conflicts with other services using port 80, to enhance security by obscuring the standard port, or to run multiple Apache instances on the same machine. This guide will walk you through the process of changing the Apache port from 80 to another port, such as 8080 or any other valid and unused port.

## Why Change the Apache Port?

Before diving into the steps, let's understand why you might want to change the default Apache port:

*   **Conflict Resolution:** Another application might already be using port 80.  Changing Apache's port resolves this conflict.
*   **Security Through Obscurity:** While not a primary security measure, changing the default port can deter some basic port scanning attacks.  It's important to remember that this isn't a substitute for proper security practices.
*   **Running Multiple Apache Instances:** If you need to run multiple Apache instances on the same server, each must listen on a different port.
*   **Development/Testing Environments:**  Sometimes, for testing purposes, you might need to run Apache on a non-standard port.

## Prerequisites

*   A server with Apache installed and running. This guide assumes you are using a Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL), but the principles apply to other operating systems as well.
*   Root or `sudo` privileges to modify configuration files.
*   A text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Here's how to change the Apache port from 80 to another port, for example, 8080. Remember to replace `8080` with your desired port number if you choose a different one.

**1. Identify the Apache Configuration Files:**

The configuration files you need to modify vary depending on your operating system and Apache version.  Common locations include:

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `/etc/apache2/ports.conf` and `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` (or the name of your virtual host configuration file).
*   **CentOS/RHEL:** `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/default.conf` (or the name of your virtual host configuration file).

**2. Edit the `ports.conf` File (Debian/Ubuntu):**

Open the `ports.conf` file with root privileges using your text editor of choice.  For example:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```

Look for the line `Listen 80`. Change it to `Listen 8080` (or your desired port):

```
# /etc/apache2/ports.conf

Listen 8080
```

Save the file and exit the editor.

**3. Edit the Virtual Host Configuration File:**

Next, you need to modify the virtual host configuration file to reflect the new port. For the default virtual host, the file is often named `000-default.conf` and located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

Look for the `<VirtualHost *:80>` directive. Change it to `<VirtualHost *:8080>`:

```xml
<VirtualHost *:8080>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Save the file and exit the editor.  If you have multiple virtual hosts, repeat this step for each of them.

**4. Edit the `httpd.conf` File (CentOS/RHEL):**

On CentOS/RHEL, the main configuration file is usually `httpd.conf`.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

Search for the line `Listen 80`. Change it to `Listen 8080`:

```
# /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Listen 8080
```

Save the file and exit the editor.

**5.  Virtual Host Configuration (CentOS/RHEL):**

If you have virtual hosts defined in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/`, modify the corresponding configuration files. For example, if you have a file named `yourwebsite.conf`, open it:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/yourwebsite.conf
```

Modify the `<VirtualHost *:80>` directive to `<VirtualHost *:8080>`.

Save the file and exit the editor.

**6. Adjust the Firewall:**

If you have a firewall enabled (which is highly recommended), you need to allow traffic on the new port (8080 in our example).

*   **ufw (Ubuntu):**

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow 8080
    sudo ufw delete allow 80
    sudo ufw enable
    ```

*   **firewalld (CentOS/RHEL):**

    ```bash
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=80/tcp
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

**7. Restart Apache:**

After making the changes, you need to restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

*   **CentOS/RHEL:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

**8. Verify the Changes:**

After restarting Apache, verify that it is listening on the new port. You can use the `netstat` or `ss` command:

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep apache
```

or

```bash
sudo ss -tulnp | grep apache
```

The output should show Apache listening on port 8080 (or your chosen port).

**9. Accessing Your Website:**

Now, access your website using your server's IP address or domain name followed by the new port number. For example, if your server's IP address is `192.168.1.100`, you would access it using `http://192.168.1.100:8080`.  If you are using a domain name, it would be `http://yourdomain.com:8080`.

## Important Considerations

*   **Port Selection:**  Choose a port number that is not commonly used by other applications.  Ports above 1024 are typically safe.  Check a list of well-known ports before choosing one.
*   **Security Implications:**  Changing the port is *not* a replacement for proper security measures like firewalls, SSL/TLS encryption, and regular security updates.  It provides only a small layer of obscurity.
*   **Client Configuration:**  If you are using any client-side applications or APIs that interact with your website, you will need to update them to use the new port number.
*   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your website after changing the port to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Apache Fails to Start:** Double-check your configuration files for typos or errors. Use the `apachectl configtest` command to check the syntax of your configuration files (Debian/Ubuntu) or `httpd -t` (CentOS/RHEL).  Examine the Apache error logs for more detailed information.
*   **Website Not Accessible:** Ensure that your firewall is configured to allow traffic on the new port. Verify that Apache is actually listening on the new port using `netstat` or `ss`.
*   **Incorrect Virtual Host Configuration:**  Make sure you have correctly updated all virtual host configuration files to use the new port.

## Conclusion

Changing the Apache port is a straightforward process, but it's crucial to follow the steps carefully and understand the implications. By following this guide, you can successfully change your Apache port, configure your firewall, and ensure your website remains accessible. Remember to prioritize security and thoroughly test your changes.
