# MS Access InstrRev() Function: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The `InstrRev()` function in MS Access is a powerful tool for string manipulation, allowing you to search for the last occurrence of a substring within a larger string. Unlike the `InStr()` function which searches from the beginning, `InstrRev()` starts its search from the end of the string. This makes it particularly useful when you need to find the final instance of a delimiter or pattern.

This comprehensive guide will explore the `InstrRev()` function in detail, covering its syntax, parameters, return values, and practical examples. We'll delve into various scenarios where `InstrRev()` can be applied to solve real-world problems within your Access databases.

## Understanding the `InstrRev()` Function

The `InstrRev()` function returns the position of the first occurrence of one string within another, searching from the end of string. It returns 0 if no match is found.

### Syntax

The syntax for the `InstrRev()` function is as follows:

```vba
InstrRev([start, ]stringcheck, stringmatch[, compare])
```

Let's break down each parameter:

*   **`start` (Optional):**  This numeric expression sets the starting position for each search. If `start` is omitted, the search begins at the last character position of `stringcheck`.  If `start` contains Null, Null is returned.

*   **`stringcheck` (Required):** This is the string expression being searched. If `stringcheck` contains Null, Null is returned.

*   **`stringmatch` (Required):** This is the string expression to search for. If `stringmatch` contains Null, Null is returned.

*   **`compare` (Optional):** This numeric value indicates the type of string comparison to use.  It can be one of the following values:

    *   **`vbBinaryCompare` (0):** Performs a binary comparison (case-sensitive). This is the default if `compare` is omitted.
    *   **`vbTextCompare` (1):** Performs a textual comparison (case-insensitive).
    *   **`vbDatabaseCompare` (2):**  Uses the setting specified in your Access database. *Note: This is deprecated and should generally be avoided in modern development.*

### Return Values

The `InstrRev()` function returns different values depending on the scenario:

*   **If `stringcheck` is zero-length:** Returns 0.
*   **If `stringmatch` is zero-length:** Returns the value of `start`.
*   **If `stringmatch` is not found:** Returns 0.
*   **If `stringmatch` is found within `stringcheck`:** Returns the position where the match is found, counting from the beginning of `stringcheck`.
*   **If `start` > Len(`stringcheck`):** Returns 0.

## Practical Examples of `InstrRev()` in Action

Let's explore several practical examples that demonstrate the power and versatility of the `InstrRev()` function in MS Access.

### Example 1: Finding the Last Backslash in a File Path

This example shows how to extract the filename from a full file path.

```vba
Sub ExtractFilename()
    Dim FilePath As String
    Dim LastBackslash As Integer
    Dim Filename As String

    FilePath = "C:\Users\Documents\MyFolder\MyDocument.docx"
    LastBackslash = InstrRev(FilePath, "\")

    If LastBackslash > 0 Then
        Filename = Mid(FilePath, LastBackslash + 1)
        MsgBox "Filename: " & Filename
    Else
        MsgBox "Invalid File Path"
    End If

End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We define a variable `FilePath` containing the full path to a document.
2.  We use `InstrRev()` to find the position of the last backslash (`\`) in the `FilePath`.
3.  If a backslash is found (i.e., `LastBackslash > 0`), we use the `Mid()` function to extract the filename, starting from the character after the last backslash.
4.  Finally, we display the extracted filename using a message box.  If no backslash is found, an "Invalid File Path" message is displayed.

### Example 2: Finding the Last Comma in a String

This example demonstrates finding the last comma in a comma-separated string. This is useful when dealing with CSV data.

```vba
Sub FindLastComma()
    Dim CommaSeparatedString As String
    Dim LastCommaPosition As Integer

    CommaSeparatedString = "Apple,Banana,Orange,Grape"
    LastCommaPosition = InstrRev(CommaSeparatedString, ",")

    If LastCommaPosition > 0 Then
        MsgBox "Last Comma Position: " & LastCommaPosition
    Else
        MsgBox "No comma found in the string."
    End If
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We define a string `CommaSeparatedString` containing comma-separated values.
2.  We use `InstrRev()` to locate the position of the last comma within the string.
3.  The result (the position of the last comma) is then displayed in a message box.

### Example 3: Using `start` Argument to Limit the Search

This example shows how to use the optional `start` argument to restrict the search to a specific portion of the string, starting from the right.

```vba
Sub FindLastOccurrenceWithStart()
    Dim MyString As String
    Dim LastOccurrence As Integer

    MyString = "This is a test string, test string"
    LastOccurrence = InstrRev(MyString, "test", 25) ' Start searching from position 25 (from the start)

    If LastOccurrence > 0 Then
        MsgBox "Last occurrence of 'test' found at position: " & LastOccurrence
    Else
        MsgBox "'test' not found in the specified portion of the string."
    End If
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We have a string `MyString` containing the word "test" multiple times.
2.  We use `InstrRev()` with the `start` argument set to `25`. This means the function will search for "test" starting from the 25th character from the *beginning* of the string, and moving *backwards* towards the beginning.  This effectively limits the search area.
3.  The result of the search is then displayed in a message box.

### Example 4: Case-Insensitive Search using `vbTextCompare`

This example demonstrates how to perform a case-insensitive search using the `vbTextCompare` option.

```vba
Sub CaseInsensitiveSearch()
    Dim MyString As String
    Dim LastOccurrence As Integer

    MyString = "This is a Test String"
    LastOccurrence = InstrRev(MyString, "test", , vbTextCompare) ' Case-insensitive comparison

    If LastOccurrence > 0 Then
        MsgBox "Last occurrence of 'test' (case-insensitive) found at position: " & LastOccurrence
    Else
        MsgBox "'test' not found in the string (case-insensitive)."
    End If
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We have a string `MyString` containing the word "Test" with an uppercase "T".
2.  We use `InstrRev()` with the `compare` argument set to `vbTextCompare`. This tells the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
3.  The result of the search (in this case, finding "Test" even though we searched for "test") is displayed in a message box.

### Example 5:  Using InstrRev to Validate File Extensions

This example checks if a filename has a specific extension, by looking for the last period and comparing the extension.

```vba
Sub ValidateFileExtension(Filename As String, ExpectedExtension As String)
    Dim LastPeriod As Integer
    Dim FileExtension As String

    LastPeriod = InstrRev(Filename, ".")

    If LastPeriod > 0 Then
        FileExtension = Mid(Filename, LastPeriod + 1)
        If LCase(FileExtension) = LCase(ExpectedExtension) Then
            MsgBox "File extension is valid."
        Else
            MsgBox "File extension is invalid."
        End If
    Else
        MsgBox "No extension found."
    End If

End Sub

Sub TestValidateFileExtension()
  ValidateFileExtension "myfile.txt", "txt"  'Valid
  ValidateFileExtension "myfile.pdf", "txt"  'Invalid
  ValidateFileExtension "myfile", "txt"       'No extension found
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define a function `ValidateFileExtension` that takes the filename and the expected extension as input.
2. It finds the position of the last period (`.`) in the filename using `InstrRev`.
3. If a period is found, it extracts the file extension using `Mid`.
4. It compares the extracted extension (converted to lowercase) with the expected extension (also converted to lowercase) to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
5. The result is displayed in a message box.  If no period is found, it indicates that no extension exists.

## Common Use Cases for `InstrRev()`

The `InstrRev()` function is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

*   **Parsing File Paths:**  Extracting filenames, directories, or extensions from file paths.
*   **Data Cleaning:**  Identifying and removing unwanted characters or patterns from the end of strings.
*   **String Validation:**  Checking if a string ends with a specific suffix or pattern.
*   **Text Processing:**  Analyzing and manipulating text data, such as finding the last occurrence of a word or phrase.
*   **Working with Delimited Data:**  Parsing data from CSV or other delimited files.

## Best Practices for Using `InstrRev()`

*   **Error Handling:**  Always check the return value of `InstrRev()` to ensure that the substring was found. Handle cases where the substring is not found gracefully.
*   **Case Sensitivity:**  Be mindful of case sensitivity. Use the `compare` argument ( `vbTextCompare` for case-insensitive search) if necessary.
*   **Null Values:**  Be aware that passing Null values to `InstrRev()` will result in Null being returned.  Consider using the `Nz()` function to handle potential Null values.  For example, `InstrRev(Nz(MyString,""), "test")`  will return 0 if MyString is null.
*   **Performance:**  While `InstrRev()` is generally efficient, avoid using it excessively in performance-critical sections of your code. Consider alternative approaches if performance becomes an issue.
