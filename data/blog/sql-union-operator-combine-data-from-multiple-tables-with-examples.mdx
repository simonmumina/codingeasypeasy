# SQL UNION Operator: Combine Data from Multiple Tables with Examples

The SQL `UNION` operator is a powerful tool for combining the result-sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result-set. This is especially useful when you need to consolidate data from multiple tables or views that have similar structures. This comprehensive guide explores the `UNION` operator in detail, covering its syntax, behavior, use cases, and practical examples.

## What is the SQL UNION Operator?

The `UNION` operator combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows from the combined result set (unless you use `UNION ALL`). The columns selected in each `SELECT` statement must have the same data type and be in the same order.

## UNION vs. UNION ALL

It's crucial to understand the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`:

- **`UNION`**: Removes duplicate rows from the combined result set. This requires the database to perform an extra step of identifying and eliminating duplicates, which can impact performance, especially with large datasets.

- **`UNION ALL`**: Includes all rows from each `SELECT` statement in the combined result set, _without_ removing duplicates. This is faster than `UNION` because it skips the duplicate removal process.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for the `UNION` operator is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
WHERE condition2;
```

And for `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
WHERE condition2;
```

**Key Requirements:**

- **Number of Columns:** Each `SELECT` statement must select the same number of columns.
- **Data Types:** The corresponding columns in each `SELECT` statement must have compatible data types. The database will often attempt to implicitly convert data types, but it's best to ensure they are the same to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Column Order:** The order of the columns in each `SELECT` statement must be the same. The column names in the final result set are typically taken from the first `SELECT` statement.

## Example Scenario: Combining Customer Data

Let's imagine we have two tables: `Customers_USA` and `Customers_Europe`. Both tables contain customer information, but are stored separately for organizational reasons.

**Table: `Customers_USA`**

| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Country |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1          | John      | Smith    | USA     |
| 2          | Jane      | Doe      | USA     |
| 3          | Peter     | Jones    | USA     |

**Table: `Customers_Europe`**

| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Country |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| 4          | Anna      | Schmidt  | Germany |
| 5          | Marie     | Dubois   | France  |
| 6          | John      | Smith    | UK      |

**Example 1: Using `UNION` to Get a Unique List of Customers**

This query combines the customer information from both tables and removes any duplicate entries (based on all selected columns).

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_USA
UNION
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_Europe;
```

**Result:**

| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Country |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1          | John      | Smith    | USA     |
| 2          | Jane      | Doe      | USA     |
| 3          | Peter     | Jones    | USA     |
| 4          | Anna      | Schmidt  | Germany |
| 5          | Marie     | Dubois   | France  |
| 6          | John      | Smith    | UK      |

Notice that even though John Smith appears in both tables, he only appears once in the result set because `UNION` removes duplicates.

**Example 2: Using `UNION ALL` to Get All Customers (Including Duplicates)**

This query combines the customer information from both tables, _including_ any duplicate entries.

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_USA
UNION ALL
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_Europe;
```

**Result:**

| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Country |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1          | John      | Smith    | USA     |
| 2          | Jane      | Doe      | USA     |
| 3          | Peter     | Jones    | USA     |
| 4          | Anna      | Schmidt  | Germany |
| 5          | Marie     | Dubois   | France  |
| 6          | John      | Smith    | UK      |
| 1          | John      | Smith    | USA     | Duplicate! |
| 2          | Jane      | Doe      | USA     |
| 3          | Peter     | Jones    | USA     |

Now, John Smith appears twice because `UNION ALL` preserves duplicates.

## More Complex Examples

The `UNION` operator can be used in more complex scenarios, including:

**Example 3: Combining Data with Different Column Names (Using Aliases)**

Let's say the `Customers_Europe` table has slightly different column names:

**Table: `Customers_Europe` (Updated)**

| CustID | FName | LName   | CountryCode |
| ------ | ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| 4      | Anna  | Schmidt | Germany     |
| 5      | Marie | Dubois  | France      |
| 6      | John  | Smith   | UK          |

To use `UNION`, we need to alias the columns to match the `Customers_USA` table:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_USA
UNION
SELECT CustID AS CustomerID, FName AS FirstName, LName AS LastName, CountryCode AS Country
FROM Customers_Europe;
```

This query will successfully combine the data because the columns are aliased to match in number, data type, and order.

**Example 4: Using `WHERE` Clauses with `UNION`**

You can use `WHERE` clauses to filter the data before combining it:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_USA
WHERE Country = 'USA'
UNION
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_Europe
WHERE Country = 'Germany';
```

This query will only combine customers from the USA and Germany.

**Example 5: Using `ORDER BY` with `UNION`**

The `ORDER BY` clause must be placed _after_ the last `SELECT` statement in the `UNION` operation. It applies to the entire combined result set:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_USA
UNION
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM Customers_Europe
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;
```

This query will combine the data and then sort the results alphabetically by last name and then first name.

**Important Note:** You can only use one `ORDER BY` clause at the end of the entire `UNION` or `UNION ALL` statement. You cannot apply `ORDER BY` to individual `SELECT` statements within the `UNION`.

## Use Cases for the SQL UNION Operator

The `UNION` operator is useful in a variety of scenarios, including:

- **Consolidating data from multiple tables with similar schemas:** As demonstrated in the examples above, this is the most common use case.
- **Creating a unified view of data that is stored in different formats or locations.**
- **Generating reports that require combining data from different sources.**
- **Cleaning and standardizing data by removing duplicates across multiple tables.**
- **Implementing complex business logic that involves combining different datasets based on specific criteria.**

## Performance Considerations

- **`UNION ALL` is generally faster than `UNION`** because it avoids the duplicate removal process. Use `UNION ALL` when you are certain that duplicates are not a concern, or when you are willing to handle duplicates in a later step.
- **Ensure that the data types of the corresponding columns are the same** to avoid implicit data type conversions, which can impact performance.
- **Use indexes effectively** on the tables involved in the `UNION` operation to speed up data retrieval.
- **Avoid using `UNION` on very large tables** unless absolutely necessary, as the duplicate removal process can be resource-intensive. Consider alternative approaches, such as data warehousing techniques or materialized views.
- **Analyze the execution plan** of your `UNION` queries to identify potential performance bottlenecks. Most database management systems provide tools for analyzing query execution plans.

## Conclusion

The SQL `UNION` operator is a valuable tool for combining data from multiple tables. By understanding the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and by considering performance implications, you can effectively use the `UNION` operator to create powerful and efficient SQL queries. This guide provides a solid foundation for using `UNION` in your database projects. Remember to practice with different scenarios and data sets to gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities.
