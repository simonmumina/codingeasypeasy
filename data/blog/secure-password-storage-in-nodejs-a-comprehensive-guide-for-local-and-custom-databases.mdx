# Secure Password Storage in Node.js: A Comprehensive Guide for Local & Custom Databases

Protecting user passwords is paramount in any application. Storing passwords in plain text is a significant security risk, leaving your users vulnerable to attacks. This guide explores the best practices for securely storing passwords in your Node.js applications when using local or custom databases. We will focus on using `bcrypt` for password hashing and salting.

## Why Password Hashing is Crucial

Storing passwords in plain text is a recipe for disaster. If your database is compromised, attackers gain immediate access to all user credentials. Hashing transforms passwords into irreversible representations, making it significantly harder for attackers to obtain the original passwords even if they access the database.

**Hashing** is a one-way function that takes an input (password) and produces a fixed-size output (hash). The hash is computationally difficult to reverse, meaning you can't easily obtain the original password from the hash.

## Introducing Bcrypt: A Robust Password Hashing Algorithm

`bcrypt` is a widely used and highly recommended password hashing algorithm. It incorporates salting and adaptive hashing, making it resistant to various attacks, including rainbow table attacks.

**Key Features of Bcrypt:**

- **Salting:** `bcrypt` automatically generates a unique random salt for each password.
- **Adaptive Hashing:** The computational cost of `bcrypt` can be increased to make it more resistant to brute-force attacks. This is controlled by the _cost factor_ or _rounds_.
- **One-Way Function:** It's computationally infeasible to reverse the hashing process.

## Implementing Password Hashing with Bcrypt in Node.js

Let's dive into the practical implementation of `bcrypt` in a Node.js application.

**1. Installation:**

First, install the `bcrypt` library using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install bcrypt
# or
yarn add bcrypt
```

**2. Hashing a Password:**

The following code snippet demonstrates how to hash a password using `bcrypt` before storing it in your database:

```plaintext
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt')

async function hashPassword(password) {
  const saltRounds = 10 // Adjust this value for increased security (but higher computation time)

  try {
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds)
    return hashedPassword
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error hashing password:', error)
    throw error // Handle the error appropriately
  }
}

// Example usage
async function saveUserToDatabase(username, password) {
  try {
    const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password)
    //  Store the username and hashedPassword in your database here
    console.log(`User: ${username}, Hashed Password: ${hashedPassword}`)
    // Example:  Assuming you have a 'users' table and a 'db' connection
    // await db.query('INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)', [username, hashedPassword]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving user:', error)
    // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., return an error message to the user)
  }
}

// Example call to saveUserToDatabase
saveUserToDatabase('john.doe', 'P@sswOrd123')
```

**Explanation:**

- **`bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds)`:** This function takes the password and the number of salt rounds as input. The higher the number of rounds, the more secure the hashing is, but it also requires more processing power. A value of 10 is a common starting point. Experiment to find a balance between security and performance for your application.
- **`saltRounds`:** Represents the cost factor. Each increment multiplies the computation time by roughly a factor of two. Choose a value that takes a reasonable amount of time on your server.
- **`async/await`:** The `bcrypt.hash` function is asynchronous, so we use `async/await` to handle the promise and ensure the password is fully hashed before proceeding.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling is crucial. Always wrap your password hashing logic in a `try...catch` block to catch any potential errors and handle them appropriately. Don't just `console.log` the error; return a user-friendly error message or log the error details for debugging purposes.
- **Database Storage:** The example code shows where you would store the username and the `hashedPassword` into your database. Remember _never_ store the original password.

**3. Verifying a Password:**

When a user attempts to log in, you need to verify that the entered password matches the stored hash. `bcrypt` provides a function for this:

```plaintext
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt')

async function comparePassword(password, hashedPassword) {
  try {
    const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword)
    return match // Returns true if the password matches, false otherwise
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error comparing passwords:', error)
    return false // Handle the error appropriately
  }
}

// Example usage
async function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  // 1. Retrieve the user from the database based on the username
  // Example:
  // const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [username]);
  // if (!user || user.length === 0) {
  //   console.log("User not found");
  //   return false; // User not found
  // }

  // For demonstration purposes, let's hardcode a user with a known hashed password
  const user = {
    username: 'john.doe',
    password: '$2b$10$YOUR_HASHED_PASSWORD_HERE', // Replace with a real hashed password
  }

  if (!user) {
    console.log('User not found')
    return false // User not found
  }

  try {
    const match = await comparePassword(password, user.password)

    if (match) {
      console.log('Authentication successful!')
      return true
    } else {
      console.log('Authentication failed.')
      return false
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during authentication:', error)
    return false // Handle error appropriately.
  }
}

// Example call to authenticateUser
authenticateUser('john.doe', 'P@sswOrd123')
```

**Explanation:**

- **`bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword)`:** This function compares the provided password with the stored hash. It automatically uses the salt embedded within the hash to perform the comparison.
- **Important:** You _must_ retrieve the `hashedPassword` from your database first, based on the user's username or other identifying information.
- **Return Value:** `bcrypt.compare()` returns `true` if the password matches the hash and `false` otherwise.
- **Error Handling:** As with hashing, error handling is crucial. Wrap the comparison logic in a `try...catch` block and handle any potential errors gracefully. Returning `false` on error is a safe default, but you might also want to log the error for debugging.

## Best Practices for Secure Password Storage

- **Always Use a Strong Hashing Algorithm:** `bcrypt` is the recommended choice. Avoid weaker algorithms like MD5 or SHA1, which are easily cracked.
- **Use a Sufficiently High Cost Factor:** Adjust the `saltRounds` value in `bcrypt` to increase the computation time and make it harder for attackers to brute-force the passwords.
- **Salt Each Password Individually:** `bcrypt` handles this automatically. Never use the same salt for multiple passwords.
- **Store Hashes, Not Passwords:** Never store the original passwords in your database.
- **Implement Rate Limiting:** Protect your login endpoint from brute-force attacks by implementing rate limiting.
- **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep your `bcrypt` library and other dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.
- **Secure Your Database:** Protect your database from unauthorized access with strong authentication, access control, and encryption.
- **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all communication between the client and the server is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Consider Using a Password Manager:** Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords and to use a reputable password manager.
- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of verification in addition to their password.

## Working with Different Database Types

The code examples above are database agnostic. The key is to adapt the `saveUserToDatabase` and `authenticateUser` functions to interact with your specific database system. Here's how you might approach it with a few different database types:

- **MySQL:** Use a MySQL driver like `mysql2` or `promise-mysql` to connect to your database and execute queries to store and retrieve the hashed password.
- **PostgreSQL:** Use the `pg` library to connect to your PostgreSQL database and execute queries.
- **MongoDB:** Use the `mongoose` or the native MongoDB driver to interact with your MongoDB database. Store the hashed password in a document within a collection.
- **SQLite:** Use the `sqlite3` library to interact with your SQLite database.
- **Custom Database (e.g., a File-Based JSON Store):** You'll need to write your own functions to read and write data to your custom storage format. Ensure your file storage is protected from unauthorized access.

**Example with MongoDB (using Mongoose):**

```plaintext
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt')

// Define a user schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
})

// Pre-save middleware to hash the password
userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
  const user = this // `this` refers to the document being saved
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next() // Only hash if password has been modified

  const saltRounds = 10
  try {
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, saltRounds)
    user.password = hashedPassword
    next()
  } catch (error) {
    return next(error)
  }
})

// Method to compare passwords
userSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (password) {
  return bcrypt.compare(password, this.password)
}

// Create a model
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

// Example usage (assuming you have a connected Mongoose instance)
async function createUser(username, password) {
  try {
    const user = new User({ username, password })
    await user.save()
    console.log('User created successfully!')
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error creating user:', err)
  }
}

async function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  try {
    const user = await User.findOne({ username })
    if (!user) {
      console.log('User not found.')
      return false
    }

    const isMatch = await user.comparePassword(password)
    if (isMatch) {
      console.log('Authentication successful!')
      return true
    } else {
      console.log('Authentication failed.')
      return false
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error during authentication:', err)
    return false
  }
}

// Connect to MongoDB (replace with your connection string)
mongoose
  .connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB')

    // Example calls
    createUser('testuser', 'MySecretPassword123').then(() =>
      authenticateUser('testuser', 'MySecretPassword123')
    )
  })
  .catch((err) => console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err))
```

**Important Considerations for Custom Databases:**

- **File Permissions:** If you're using a file to store your data, ensure that the file has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access. Restrict access to the file to the user account that your Node.js application runs under.
- **Data Encryption:** Consider encrypting the entire file containing your user data for an extra layer of security.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy for your database to prevent data loss.
- **Security Audits:** Regularly audit your code and infrastructure for potential security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Securely storing passwords is a critical aspect of building secure Node.js applications. By using `bcrypt` for password hashing and following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can significantly reduce the risk of password-related security breaches and protect your users' data. Remember to tailor the database interactions to your specific database type and always prioritize security in your application design and development process.
