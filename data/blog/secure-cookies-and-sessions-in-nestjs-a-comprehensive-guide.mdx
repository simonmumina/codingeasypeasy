# Secure Cookies and Sessions in NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide

Securing your application is paramount, especially when dealing with user data and sensitive information.  Cookies and sessions are fundamental to maintaining user state in web applications, making them prime targets for malicious attacks. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the essential steps to secure cookies and sessions in your NestJS application, mitigating common vulnerabilities and ensuring a robust and secure user experience.

## Why Security Matters for Cookies and Sessions

Cookies and sessions, while seemingly simple, are critical for maintaining user sessions and personalizing user experiences. If not secured properly, they can be exploited to:

*   **Steal User Identities:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts by stealing session cookies.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:**  Malicious scripts injected into your application can steal cookies.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks:**  Attackers can trick users into performing unintended actions on your application.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can intercept and hijack user sessions.

Therefore, implementing robust security measures for cookies and sessions is crucial for protecting your users and your application's reputation.

## Essential Security Measures for Cookies

Here are the key security measures you should implement to protect your cookies:

### 1. `httpOnly` Flag

The `httpOnly` flag prevents client-side scripts (like JavaScript) from accessing the cookie. This dramatically reduces the risk of XSS attacks because even if an attacker injects malicious JavaScript, it won't be able to read or manipulate the cookie.

**Implementation in NestJS (using `cookie-parser` middleware):**

First, install the `cookie-parser` middleware:

```bash
npm install cookie-parser --save
```

Then, in your `main.ts` file:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import * as cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.use(cookieParser()); // Important: Use cookieParser before any route handlers that use cookies

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

**Setting `httpOnly` in your controller:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Res, Req, HttpStatus } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

@Controller('auth')
export class AuthController {
  @Get('login')
  login(@Res({ passthrough: true }) res: Response, @Req() req: Request) {
    // In a real application, you would authenticate the user here.

    res.cookie('session_id', '1234567890', {
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // Use secure cookies in production
      sameSite: 'strict', // Recommended for CSRF protection
      path: '/',
      // Optionally, set a maxAge for the cookie
      // maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 1000, // 7 days in milliseconds
    });

    return { message: 'Logged in' };
  }

  @Get('logout')
  logout(@Res({ passthrough: true }) res: Response) {
    res.clearCookie('session_id');
    return { message: 'Logged out' };
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `httpOnly: true`:  This sets the `httpOnly` flag, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie.
*   `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`: The `secure` flag ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.  **Important:**  Always set this to `true` in production environments.  Conditionally setting it based on `NODE_ENV` allows you to test locally without HTTPS.
*   `sameSite: 'strict'`:  This setting helps prevent CSRF attacks.  We'll delve deeper into CSRF later.  `'lax'` is also an option, but `'strict'` provides the strongest protection.
*   `path: '/'`: Defines the path for which the cookie is valid.  Setting it to `/` makes it available for the entire application.
*   `maxAge`: Defines the lifespan of the cookie in milliseconds.  If not set, the cookie becomes a session cookie and is deleted when the browser closes.

### 2. `secure` Flag

The `secure` flag ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Why HTTPS is Critical:**  Without HTTPS, cookies (and other sensitive data) are transmitted in plain text, making them vulnerable to interception.

**Implementation:**  As shown in the code above, set the `secure` flag to `true` in production:

```typescript
res.cookie('session_id', '1234567890', {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // Crucial for HTTPS only
  sameSite: 'strict',
  path: '/',
});
```

**Important Note:** Make sure your NestJS application is properly configured to use HTTPS.  This usually involves obtaining and configuring an SSL/TLS certificate.  Tools like Let's Encrypt can help you obtain free SSL certificates.

### 3. `sameSite` Attribute

The `sameSite` attribute helps prevent CSRF attacks by controlling when the browser sends the cookie with cross-site requests.  There are three possible values:

*   **`Strict`:**  The cookie is only sent with requests originating from the same site.  This offers the strongest CSRF protection but might break some legitimate cross-site scenarios.
*   **`Lax`:** The cookie is sent with same-site requests and top-level navigation that changes the HTTP method from GET to POST.  This provides a good balance between security and usability.  It is often the recommended choice.
*   **`None`:**  The cookie is sent with all requests, regardless of origin. This effectively disables CSRF protection and should only be used with extreme caution.  If you use `SameSite=None`, you **must** also set `Secure=true`.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
res.cookie('session_id', '1234567890', {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'strict', // or 'lax', or 'none' (with Secure=true)
  path: '/',
});
```

**Choosing the Right `sameSite` Value:**

*   **Start with `strict`:**  Test your application thoroughly to see if it breaks any cross-site functionality.
*   **If `strict` causes issues, switch to `lax`:**  This often provides sufficient protection without breaking legitimate use cases.
*   **Avoid `none` unless absolutely necessary:**  If you must use `none`, ensure you have other CSRF mitigation strategies in place (like CSRF tokens).

### 4. Cookie Prefixing (Less Common but Useful)

Cookie prefixes are a technique for ensuring that cookies are set securely.  There are two types:

*   `__Secure-`:  Cookies with this prefix can only be set if the `secure` attribute is also set to `true`.
*   `__Host-`:  Cookies with this prefix must have the `secure` attribute set to `true`, must be set from the domain they are intended for, and must have the `path` attribute set to `/`.

While not universally supported by all browsers, cookie prefixes provide an extra layer of security.

**Example (Implementation would require modifications to your cookie-setting logic):**

```typescript
res.cookie('__Secure-session_id', '1234567890', {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true, // Required for __Secure- prefix
  sameSite: 'strict',
  path: '/',
});
```

### 5. Rotating Session IDs

Regularly rotating session IDs makes it harder for attackers to exploit stolen session cookies. After a certain period (e.g., after a login or after a period of inactivity), generate a new session ID and invalidate the old one.

**Implementation (Conceptual Example):**

You would need to store session data server-side (e.g., in a database or Redis).  The session ID would be the key to that data.

1.  **After successful login:** Generate a new session ID, create a new session record in the database with the user's data, and delete the old session record.  Set the new session ID as a cookie.
2.  **Periodically (e.g., every hour):** Generate a new session ID, copy the user's session data to the new session record, delete the old session record, and set the new session ID as a cookie.

This is a more complex implementation and requires server-side session management.

### 6. Limiting Cookie Lifespan (`maxAge` or `expires`)

Don't allow cookies to live forever. Set a reasonable `maxAge` or `expires` value to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.  Consider the trade-off between security and user convenience. Shorter lifespans are more secure but require users to re-authenticate more often.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
res.cookie('session_id', '1234567890', {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'strict',
  path: '/',
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 1000, // 7 days in milliseconds
});
```

### 7. Input Validation and Output Encoding

While primarily focused on XSS prevention, proper input validation and output encoding are crucial for cookie security.  Never trust user input and always sanitize and encode data before displaying it or storing it in cookies.  This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code that could steal cookies.  This is a broader security concern but directly relates to the context of cookie safety.

## Securing Sessions in NestJS

While cookies often *store* session IDs, the session data itself should be stored server-side. NestJS provides various modules for managing sessions, allowing you to store session data in memory, a database, or a Redis store.

### Using `@nestjs/platform-express` with `express-session`

This is a common approach for integrating sessions into your NestJS application.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install --save @nestjs/platform-express express-session
    npm install --save-dev @types/express-session
    ```

2.  **Configure `express-session`:**

    In your `main.ts` file:

    ```typescript
    import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
    import { AppModule } from './app.module';
    import * as session from 'express-session';

    async function bootstrap() {
      const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

      app.use(
        session({
          secret: 'your-secret-key', // Replace with a strong, random secret
          resave: false,
          saveUninitialized: false,
          cookie: {
            httpOnly: true,
            secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
            sameSite: 'strict',
            maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 1000, // 7 days
          },
        }),
      );

      await app.listen(3000);
    }
    bootstrap();
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   `secret`:  **Important:** Replace `'your-secret-key'` with a strong, randomly generated secret.  This is used to sign the session ID cookie.  Store this secret securely (e.g., in environment variables).
*   `resave`:  `false` generally improves performance. Only save the session if something changed.
*   `saveUninitialized`:  `false` prevents saving empty sessions (sessions that haven't been modified).
*   `cookie`:  This is where you configure the cookie security options (same as before: `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite`, `maxAge`).

3. **Accessing Session Data**

   In your controller:

   ```typescript
   import { Controller, Get, Req, Session } from '@nestjs/common';
   import { Request } from 'express';

   @Controller('session')
   export class SessionController {
     @Get('set')
     setSession(@Session() session: Record<string, any>, @Req() req: Request): string {
       session.views = (session.views || 0) + 1;
       // set user id after login
       if (req.query.userId){
        session.userId = req.query.userId
       }
       return `Views: ${session.views} ${session.userId ? 'userId: '+session.userId : ''}`;
     }

     @Get('get')
     getSession(@Session() session: Record<string, any>): string {
       return `Views: ${session.views} ${session.userId ? 'userId: '+session.userId : ''}`;
     }
   }
   ```

**Important Considerations for `express-session`:**

*   **Memory Store (Default):**  The default session store is in-memory.  This is fine for development but **not suitable for production.**  It's not scalable and data will be lost when the server restarts.
*   **Use a Persistent Session Store (Redis, Database):**  For production, use a persistent session store like Redis or a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).  This ensures that session data is preserved across server restarts and can be shared across multiple server instances.

    *   **Redis Example:**

        ```bash
        npm install connect-redis redis
        npm install --save-dev @types/connect-redis
        ```

        ```typescript
        import * as session from 'express-session';
        import * as connectRedis from 'connect-redis';
        import * as redis from 'redis';

        async function bootstrap() {
          const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

          const RedisStore = connectRedis(session);
          const redisClient = redis.createClient({
            host: 'localhost', // Replace with your Redis host
            port: 6379,        // Replace with your Redis port
          });

          app.use(
            session({
              store: new RedisStore({ client: redisClient }),
              secret: 'your-secret-key',
              resave: false,
              saveUninitialized: false,
              cookie: {
                httpOnly: true,
                secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
                sameSite: 'strict',
                maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 1000,
              },
            }),
          );

          await app.listen(3000);
        }
        ```

### Preventing CSRF Attacks

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where a malicious website tricks a user into performing actions on another website where they are authenticated.

**Strategies for Preventing CSRF:**

1.  **`sameSite` Attribute (Primary Defense):**  As discussed earlier, using `sameSite: 'strict'` or `sameSite: 'lax'` is the first line of defense against CSRF.

2.  **CSRF Tokens:**  Generate a unique, unpredictable token for each user session. Include this token as a hidden field in your forms and as a header in your AJAX requests. The server should verify the token on each request.

    **Implementation (Conceptual Example using `csurf` middleware):**

    ```bash
    npm install csurf
    npm install --save-dev @types/csurf
    ```

    ```typescript
    import * as csurf from 'csurf';

    async function bootstrap() {
      const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

      app.use(csurf());

      // Add middleware to set the CSRF token in the response header
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.setHeader('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        next();
      });

      await app.listen(3000);
    }
    ```

    **In your frontend (assuming you're using a framework like React or Angular):**

    1.  Retrieve the `XSRF-TOKEN` from the response headers on initial page load.
    2.  Include the token in the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header for all subsequent requests (especially POST, PUT, DELETE).

    **Important Notes about CSRF Tokens:**

    *   **Session Affinity:** CSRF tokens should be tied to the user's session.
    *   **Uniqueness:** Tokens must be unique and unpredictable.
    *   **Double Submit Cookie (Alternative for stateless applications):**  Set a cookie containing the CSRF token and include the same token as a request header.  The server verifies that the cookie and the header match.

3.  **Double-Check Requests:**  For sensitive operations (e.g., changing passwords), require users to re-authenticate or confirm the action.

4.  **Avoid GET Requests for State-Changing Operations:**  Use POST, PUT, or DELETE requests for operations that modify data.  GET requests are more susceptible to CSRF.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

While not directly related to cookie security, CORS misconfiguration can expose your application to security risks.  If your NestJS API is accessed from a different domain (e.g., your frontend is hosted on `example.com` and your API is on `api.example.com`), you need to configure CORS properly.

**Common CORS Issues:**

*   **Allowing `*` for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in production:** This allows any origin to access your API, which can be a security risk.
*   **Not handling preflight requests (OPTIONS) correctly:**  Browsers send preflight requests to check if the server allows cross-origin requests.  If not handled correctly, requests might be blocked.
*   **Not setting `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` when using cookies or authorization headers:**  If your API relies on cookies or authorization headers, you need to explicitly allow credentials to be sent with cross-origin requests.

**Implementation (using `@nestjs/platform-express`):**

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  app.enableCors({
    origin: 'https://your-frontend-domain.com', // Replace with your actual frontend domain
    credentials: true, // Required for cookies and authorization headers
  });

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

**Explanation:**

*   `origin`:  Specify the exact origin(s) that are allowed to access your API.  You can also use a function to dynamically determine the origin based on the request.
*   `credentials: true`:  Allows the browser to send cookies and authorization headers with cross-origin requests.

**Important CORS Considerations:**

*   **Be specific with your allowed origins:**  Avoid using `*` in production.
*   **Handle preflight requests correctly:**  The `enableCors` method handles preflight requests automatically.
*   **Ensure `credentials: true` is set when necessary:**  If you're using cookies or authorization headers, don't forget to set this option.

## Conclusion

Securing cookies and sessions in your NestJS application is a multi-faceted process that requires careful attention to detail. By implementing the measures outlined in this guide – including `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite`, session ID rotation, CSRF protection, and proper CORS configuration – you can significantly reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and protect your users' data. Remember to stay informed about the latest security best practices and regularly review and update your security measures to address emerging threats.  Always prioritize security throughout the development lifecycle.
