# Secure JWT Authentication with Cookies: SameSite and HttpOnly in Flask

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a popular way to handle authentication and authorization in modern web applications. While often stored in local storage or session storage on the client-side, storing JWTs in cookies, especially with the `SameSite` and `HttpOnly` flags, provides a more secure approach, mitigating common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

This blog post will guide you through implementing JWT authentication using cookies with `SameSite` and `HttpOnly` flags in a Flask application. We'll cover the benefits of this approach, the code examples, and important considerations for a robust and secure implementation.

## Why Store JWTs in Cookies?

Storing JWTs in cookies offers several advantages over local storage or session storage:

*   **Protection against XSS:** When a cookie is set with the `HttpOnly` flag, it becomes inaccessible to client-side JavaScript. This significantly reduces the risk of an attacker stealing the JWT through XSS vulnerabilities. If your website is compromised by a XSS attack, the attacker cannot access the JWT stored in an HttpOnly cookie.

*   **Mitigation of CSRF:** The `SameSite` attribute controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-site requests. Setting `SameSite` to `Strict` or `Lax` helps prevent CSRF attacks.  `Strict` is the most secure, preventing the cookie from being sent on any cross-site request, including GET requests following a link.  `Lax` allows the cookie to be sent on safe top-level navigations (e.g., clicking a link). Choose based on your application's needs.

*   **Automatic Inclusion in Requests:** Cookies are automatically included in every request to the server, simplifying the authentication process compared to manually attaching the JWT as an `Authorization` header or in the request body.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** (version 3.7 or higher is recommended)
*   **Flask:** (A micro web framework)
*   **PyJWT:** (A Python library for encoding and decoding JWTs)

You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask PyJWT
```

## Flask Application Setup

Let's start by setting up a basic Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, make_response
import jwt
import datetime
from functools import wraps

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key' # Replace with a strong, random secret key

def token_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
        token = None
        if 'token' in request.cookies:
            token = request.cookies.get('token')

        if not token:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Token is missing!'}), 401

        try:
            data = jwt.decode(token, app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithms=["HS256"])
            #  Ideally, you would fetch user details from a database here based on data['user']
            #  For this example, we'll just return the decoded data.
            current_user = data
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Token has expired!'}), 401
        except:
            return jsonify({'message': 'Token is invalid!'}), 401

        return f(current_user, *args, **kwargs)

    return decorated

@app.route('/unprotected')
def unprotected():
    return jsonify({'message': 'Anyone can view this!'})

@app.route('/protected')
@token_required
def protected(current_user):
    return jsonify({'message': 'This is only available for people with valid tokens!', 'data': current_user})


@app.route('/login')
def login():
    auth = request.authorization

    if not auth or not auth.username or not auth.password:
        return make_response('Could not verify', 401, {'WWW-Authenticate': 'Basic realm="Login Required"'})

    #  Replace this with your actual authentication logic (e.g., checking against a database)
    if auth.username == 'admin' and auth.password == 'password':
        token = jwt.encode({
            'user': auth.username,
            'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)
        }, app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithm="HS256")


        resp = make_response(jsonify({'message': 'Logged in successfully!'}), 200)
        resp.set_cookie('token', token, httponly=True, samesite='Strict') # Use 'Lax' or 'Strict' as needed
        return resp


    return make_response('Could not verify', 401, {'WWW-Authenticate': 'Basic realm="Login Required"'})


@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    resp = make_response(jsonify({'message': 'Logged out successfully!'}), 200)
    resp.set_cookie('token', '', expires=0) # Delete the cookie
    return resp


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Imports:** We import the necessary modules from Flask, `jwt`, `datetime`, and `functools`.
2.  **Flask App Configuration:**
    *   `app = Flask(__name__)`: Initializes the Flask application.
    *   `app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'`: Sets the secret key used for encoding and decoding JWTs. **Important:**  Replace `'your-secret-key'` with a strong, randomly generated secret key in a production environment. Store this key securely using environment variables.
3.  **`token_required` Decorator:**
    *   This decorator is used to protect routes that require authentication.
    *   It checks for the presence of a `token` cookie in the request.
    *   If the token is missing or invalid, it returns a 401 Unauthorized error.
    *   If the token is valid, it decodes the token, extracts user information, and passes it to the decorated function as `current_user`.  **Important:**  This example simply decodes the JWT and trusts the data inside.  In a real application, you *must* validate this user against a database to ensure their account hasn't been disabled or permissions revoked.
4.  **Routes:**
    *   `/unprotected`: A route that doesn't require authentication.
    *   `/protected`: A route that requires authentication, protected by the `token_required` decorator. It displays the user information extracted from the JWT.
    *   `/login`: This route handles user login. It uses Basic Authentication (for simplicity in this example).  **Important:**  Replace this with a more robust authentication mechanism in a production environment, such as password hashing and database lookup.  Upon successful authentication, it generates a JWT, sets it as a cookie with `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes, and returns a success response.
        *   `resp.set_cookie('token', token, httponly=True, samesite='Strict')`:  This line sets the JWT as a cookie.
            *   `httponly=True`:  Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie.
            *   `samesite='Strict'`:  Specifies that the cookie should only be sent with requests originating from the same site.  Consider `Lax` if you need the cookie to be sent on safe top-level navigations from other sites (e.g., clicking a link).
    *   `/logout`: This route handles user logout. It deletes the `token` cookie by setting its expiration time to 0.

## Understanding `HttpOnly` and `SameSite`

*   **`HttpOnly`:**  When `HttpOnly` is set to `True`, the cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript through the `document.cookie` API. This provides significant protection against XSS attacks, as an attacker injecting malicious JavaScript code cannot steal the JWT from the cookie.

*   **`SameSite`:** The `SameSite` attribute controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-site requests. It offers three possible values:
    *   **`Strict`:** The cookie is only sent with requests originating from the same site. This provides the strongest protection against CSRF attacks but might break some legitimate cross-site use cases.
    *   **`Lax`:** The cookie is sent with same-site requests and with "safe" cross-site requests, such as top-level navigations (GET requests) initiated by the user (e.g., clicking a link).
    *   **`None`:** The cookie is sent with all requests, both same-site and cross-site. When `SameSite=None` is used, the cookie *must* also be marked as `Secure` (i.e., it must only be transmitted over HTTPS).

**Choosing the Right `SameSite` Value:**

The best `SameSite` value depends on your application's specific requirements.

*   If your application doesn't require any cross-site cookie usage, `SameSite='Strict'` is the safest option.
*   If you need to support cross-site navigations (e.g., allowing users to log in from another site via a link), `SameSite='Lax'` is a good compromise.
*   `SameSite='None'` should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and is only secure when used with `Secure`.  Make sure you understand the implications before using it, and always serve your website over HTTPS.

## Testing the Application

1.  **Run the Flask application:**  `python your_app_name.py`
2.  **Log in:**  Send a `GET` request to `/login` with Basic Authentication credentials (e.g., using `curl`):

    ```bash
    curl -u admin:password http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
    ```

    This should return a JSON response with a success message, and the `Set-Cookie` header will include the JWT in the `token` cookie with `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes.
3.  **Access the protected route:** Send a `GET` request to `/protected`:

    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/protected -H "Cookie: token=<your_jwt_token>"  # If cookie isn't automatically sent
    ```

    If the cookie is correctly set in your browser, you should be able to access the protected route without explicitly including the `Cookie` header in the `curl` command.
    You should receive a JSON response with the message "This is only available for people with valid tokens!" and the decoded user data.
4.  **Access the unprotected route:** Send a `GET` request to `/unprotected`:

    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/unprotected
    ```

    You should receive a JSON response with the message "Anyone can view this!".
5. **Log out:** Send a GET request to `/logout`

   ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/logout
    ```

    This should return a JSON response with a success message and expire the cookie.

## Important Considerations

*   **HTTPS:** Always serve your application over HTTPS.  `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes are less effective (or completely ineffective with `SameSite=None`) without HTTPS.  The `Secure` attribute, which mandates that a cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS, is highly recommended.  You can set the `secure=True` parameter when creating the cookie: `resp.set_cookie('token', token, httponly=True, samesite='Strict', secure=True)`.
*   **Secret Key Management:**  Store your `SECRET_KEY` securely, using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system. Never hardcode it directly in your application code in a production environment.
*   **Token Expiration:** Set a reasonable expiration time for your JWTs to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.
*   **User Validation:**  Always validate the user ID or other identifying information from the JWT against your database to ensure the user still exists and is authorized to access the requested resources. Don't just trust the decoded JWT data.
*   **Refresh Tokens:**  Consider implementing refresh tokens to allow users to stay logged in for longer periods without constantly re-authenticating.  Refresh tokens are typically stored in a separate, more secure location (e.g., a database) and used to issue new access tokens (JWTs) when the current one expires.
*   **CORS Configuration:**  If your API and front-end are hosted on different domains, you need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly to allow your front-end to make requests to your API.  Flask-CORS is a popular extension for handling CORS in Flask. When setting up CORS, pay special attention to the `withCredentials` setting to allow cookies to be sent in cross-origin requests.
*   **Rotate your Secret Key:** It's a good security practice to rotate your secret key periodically.  This limits the impact if the key is ever compromised.

## Conclusion

Storing JWTs in cookies with `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes provides a significant security improvement over storing them in local storage or session storage. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this blog post, you can implement a more secure and robust authentication mechanism for your Flask web applications. Remember to always prioritize security and stay informed about the latest vulnerabilities and best practices in web development.
