# Effortless Syntax Highlighting in React with @mantine/prism: A Comprehensive Guide

In the world of web development, clear and readable code is essential. Presenting code snippets effectively in your applications, blog posts, or documentation greatly enhances the user experience. While there are various syntax highlighting libraries available, the `@mantine/prism` package offers a simple, powerful, and aesthetically pleasing solution tightly integrated with the Mantine UI library.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about `@mantine/prism`, from installation and basic usage to advanced customization options. We'll explore how to effortlessly integrate syntax highlighting into your React projects, making your code examples shine.

## What is @mantine/prism?

`@mantine/prism` is a React component library that leverages the popular [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) library for syntax highlighting. It provides a seamless integration of Prism.js within the Mantine UI ecosystem, offering a ready-to-use component for displaying code snippets with proper syntax highlighting. Its key features include:

- **Easy Integration:** Designed to work flawlessly with Mantine UI components, simplifying the process of adding syntax highlighting to your projects.
- **Wide Language Support:** Prism.js supports a vast range of programming languages, ensuring that your code snippets are highlighted accurately.
- **Customizable Themes:** Offers various themes to match the look and feel of your application. You can also create your own custom themes.
- **Copy to Clipboard Functionality:** Built-in support for adding a "copy to clipboard" button, allowing users to easily copy code snippets.
- **Lightweight and Performant:** Optimized for performance, ensuring that syntax highlighting doesn't negatively impact the user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that code snippets are accessible to all users.

## Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Before diving into the implementation, let's install the necessary packages.

1.  **Install Mantine and @mantine/prism:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/prism @emotion/server @emotion/react
    # or
    yarn add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/prism @emotion/server @emotion/react
    # or
    pnpm add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/prism @emotion/server @emotion/react
    ```

    **Note:** Ensure you have `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks` installed as `@mantine/prism` depends on them. `@emotion/server` and `@emotion/react` are necessary for Mantine's styling engine.

2.  **Include Provider:** Wrap your application with the `MantineProvider` to apply Mantine's styling. If you're using Next.js, this is often done in your `_app.js` or `_app.tsx` file.

    ```jsx
    // _app.js or _app.tsx
    import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core'

    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
      return (
        <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={{ colorScheme: 'light' }}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </MantineProvider>
      )
    }

    export default MyApp
    ```

## Basic Usage: Displaying Code Snippets

Now that you have everything set up, let's explore the basic usage of the `Prism` component.

```jsx
import { Prism } from '@mantine/prism'

function MyComponent() {
  const code = `
  function greet(name) {
    console.log(\`Hello, \${name}!\`);
  }

  greet("World");
  `

  return <Prism language="javascript">{code}</Prism>
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example, we import the `Prism` component from `@mantine/prism`. We define a string containing the code snippet we want to display. The `language` prop specifies the programming language of the code, which tells Prism.js how to highlight the syntax.

## Available Props and Customization

The `Prism` component accepts several props that allow you to customize its appearance and behavior:

- **`language` (string, required):** The programming language of the code snippet (e.g., "javascript", "python", "html", "css"). See the Prism.js documentation for a complete list of supported languages.
- **`children` (string, required):** The code snippet to be highlighted.
- **`className` (string):** A CSS class name to apply to the root element of the component, allowing for custom styling.
- **`style` (React.CSSProperties):** Inline styles to apply to the root element of the component.
- **`withLineNumbers` (boolean):** Whether to display line numbers. Defaults to `false`.
- **`highlightLines` (string):** A string with line numbers (separated by commas) to highlight. For example, `"1,3,5-7"` will highlight lines 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- **`copyButton` (boolean):** Whether to display a "copy to clipboard" button. Defaults to `true`. If set to false, no copy button will be displayed.
- **`onCopy` (() => void):** A callback function that is called when the code is copied to the clipboard.
- **`radius` (MantineNumberSize):** Controls the border radius of the code block. Accepts any valid Mantine number size (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) or a number in pixels. Defaults to Mantine's default radius.

Here's an example demonstrating some of these props:

```jsx
import { Prism } from '@mantine/prism'

function MyComponent() {
  const code = `
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  const result = add(5, 3);
  console.log(result); // Output: 8
  `

  return (
    <Prism language="javascript" withLineNumbers highlightLines="4" radius="md">
      {code}
    </Prism>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

This example displays the code snippet with line numbers, highlights line 4, and applies a medium border radius.

## Themes and Styling

`@mantine/prism` inherits the theme from your `MantineProvider`. You can customize the theme globally or provide custom styles directly to the `Prism` component using the `className` or `style` props.

To change the theme globally, modify the `theme` prop of your `MantineProvider`:

```jsx
import { MantineProvider, createTheme } from '@mantine/core'

const theme = createTheme({
  colorScheme: 'dark', // or 'light'
  // ... other theme customizations
})

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme} withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

You can also create custom Prism.js themes by defining CSS styles for the various tokens. Refer to the Prism.js documentation for details on the available token classes. You would then include your custom CSS stylesheet in your application and apply a class name to the `Prism` component.

## Copy to Clipboard Functionality

The `copyButton` prop enables a "copy to clipboard" button. When clicked, it copies the code snippet to the user's clipboard. The default is `true`. You can disable it by setting `copyButton` prop to `false`.

```jsx
import { Prism } from '@mantine/prism'

function MyComponent() {
  const code = `
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  `

  return (
    <Prism language="javascript" copyButton={false}>
      {code}
    </Prism>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

The `onCopy` prop allows you to execute a function after the code has been copied to the clipboard, for example, to display a notification.

## Advanced Usage: Dynamically Loading Languages

While Prism.js supports a vast array of languages, you might not need to load all of them in your application. Loading only the necessary language definitions can significantly improve performance.

You can dynamically load languages using Prism.js's `prism.js` package and the `useEffect` hook in React.

```jsx
import { Prism } from '@mantine/prism'
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import prism from 'prismjs'
import 'prismjs/components/prism-python' // Import the Python language definition

function MyComponent() {
  const code = `
  def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

  greet("World")
  `

  useEffect(() => {
    // Ensure that the Prism instance is available before attempting to highlight
    if (prism) {
      prism.highlightAll()
    }
  }, [code]) // Re-run effect when the code changes

  return <Prism language="python">{code}</Prism>
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example, we import the `prismjs` library and the Python language definition (`prismjs/components/prism-python`). The `useEffect` hook ensures that Prism.js is initialized and the code is highlighted after the component has mounted. We use `prism.highlightAll()` because the content is already rendered in the `Prism` component.

**Note:** You need to install `prismjs`:

```plaintext
npm install prismjs
# or
yarn add prismjs
# or
pnpm add prismjs
```

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Choose the Correct Language:** Always specify the correct language for your code snippets. This ensures accurate syntax highlighting.
- **Escape Special Characters:** Ensure that your code snippets are properly escaped, especially if they contain HTML entities or special characters.
- **Optimize for Performance:** Dynamically load languages when possible to reduce the initial bundle size.
- **Test with Different Themes:** Test your code snippets with different themes to ensure that they are readable and visually appealing.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that sufficient contrast is used between the text and background color for readability.
