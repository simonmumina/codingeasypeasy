# Radio Card Component in Chakra UI: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Chakra UI is a popular component library for React that provides a set of accessible and reusable UI components. Among these components, the **Radio Card** stands out as a visually appealing and intuitive way to present radio options to users. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of the Radio Card component, covering its basic usage, advanced customization, accessibility features, and best practices.

## What is the Radio Card Component?

The Radio Card component in Chakra UI is a visually enhanced version of a standard radio button. Instead of a simple circle, it presents each option as a card-like element, often containing text and potentially even icons or images. This makes the selection process more engaging and user-friendly, especially when dealing with multiple options.

## Basic Usage of the Radio Card Component

The Radio Card component is primarily used within a `RadioGroup`, which manages the state and behavior of the radio card selection.  Let's start with a simple example:

```jsx live
import { RadioGroup, Radio, Stack } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function BasicRadioCardExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('react')

  return (
    <RadioGroup onChange={setValue} value={value}>
      <Stack direction="row">
        <Radio value="react">React</Radio>
        <Radio value="vue">Vue</Radio>
        <Radio value="svelte">Svelte</Radio>
      </Stack>
    </RadioGroup>
  )
}

export default BasicRadioCardExample
```

In this example:

*   We import `RadioGroup`, `Radio`, and `Stack` from `@chakra-ui/react`.
*   `RadioGroup` acts as the container for our radio buttons and handles the state management.
*   `Radio` represents each individual radio card option. The `value` prop is crucial for identifying which radio is selected.
*   `Stack` is used to arrange the radio cards horizontally in a row.  You can use `direction="column"` for a vertical arrangement.
*   We use the `useState` hook to manage the selected value (`value`) and the `onChange` handler of the `RadioGroup` to update the state whenever a new radio button is selected.

This basic setup provides a functional Radio Card implementation. However, the appearance is currently using the default Chakra UI radio style.  Let's style it to look more like cards.

## Styling the Radio Card Component

To truly leverage the power of the Radio Card component, we need to customize its appearance. We can use Chakra UI's styling system to achieve this.  Let's add some border, padding, and a background color to simulate a card.  We'll also make the selected card visually distinct.

```jsx live
import { RadioGroup, Radio, Stack, Box, useRadio } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function CustomRadioCard({ children, ...props }) {
  const { getInputProps, getCheckboxProps } = useRadio(props)

  const input = getInputProps()
  const checkbox = getCheckboxProps()

  return (
    <Box as="label">
      <input {...input} />
      <Box
        {...checkbox}
        cursor="pointer"
        borderWidth="1px"
        borderRadius="md"
        boxShadow="md"
        _checked={{
          bg: 'teal.500',
          color: 'white',
          borderColor: 'teal.500',
        }}
        _focus={{
          boxShadow: 'outline',
        }}
        px={5}
        py={3}
      >
        {children}
      </Box>
    </Box>
  )
}


function CustomRadioCardExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('react')

  return (
    <RadioGroup onChange={setValue} value={value}>
      <Stack direction="row">
        <CustomRadioCard value="react">React</CustomRadioCard>
        <CustomRadioCard value="vue">Vue</CustomRadioCard>
        <CustomRadioCard value="svelte">Svelte</CustomRadioCard>
      </Stack>
    </RadioGroup>
  )
}

export default CustomRadioCardExample
```

In this enhanced example:

*   We create a custom `CustomRadioCard` component using `useRadio` hook. This is *essential* for creating accessible custom radio components.  `useRadio` provides all the necessary props and state management for accessibility, keyboard navigation, and proper radio button behavior.
*   `getInputProps` returns the props for the *hidden* input element.  This input element is what actually handles the radio button's functionality and is crucial for screen readers and accessibility.
*   `getCheckboxProps` returns the props for the *visible* card element that the user interacts with.
*   We style the `Box` component using Chakra UI's styling system. We add a border, border radius, box shadow, and padding to give it a card-like appearance.
*   The `_checked` pseudo-selector allows us to style the card when it's selected.  We change the background color and text color to visually indicate the selected state.
*   The `_focus` pseudo-selector adds an outline on focus for accessibility.
*   We use this custom component within our `RadioGroup`, replacing the standard `Radio` component.

This results in a much more visually appealing and intuitive Radio Card implementation.

## Advanced Customization: Icons and Images

The Radio Card component can be further enhanced by adding icons or images to each card. This can provide visual cues and make the selection process even easier for users.

```jsx live
import { RadioGroup, Radio, Stack, Box, useRadio, Image } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function CustomRadioCardWithImage({ children, imageSrc, ...props }) {
  const { getInputProps, getCheckboxProps } = useRadio(props)

  const input = getInputProps()
  const checkbox = getCheckboxProps()

  return (
    <Box as="label">
      <input {...input} />
      <Box
        {...checkbox}
        cursor="pointer"
        borderWidth="1px"
        borderRadius="md"
        boxShadow="md"
        _checked={{
          bg: 'teal.500',
          color: 'white',
          borderColor: 'teal.500',
        }}
        _focus={{
          boxShadow: 'outline',
        }}
        px={5}
        py={3}
        display="flex"
        flexDirection="column"
        alignItems="center"
      >
        <Image src={imageSrc} alt={children} boxSize="50px" objectFit="contain" mb={2} />
        {children}
      </Box>
    </Box>
  )
}


function RadioCardWithImageExample() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('react')

  return (
    <RadioGroup onChange={setValue} value={value}>
      <Stack direction="row">
        <CustomRadioCardWithImage value="react" imageSrc="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg">React</CustomRadioCardWithImage>
        <CustomRadioCardWithImage value="vue" imageSrc="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Vue.js_Logo_2.svg">Vue</CustomRadioCardWithImage>
        <CustomRadioCardWithImage value="svelte" imageSrc="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Svelte_Logo.svg">Svelte</CustomRadioCardWithImage>
      </Stack>
    </RadioGroup>
  )
}

export default RadioCardWithImageExample
```

In this example:

*   We've added an `imageSrc` prop to the `CustomRadioCardWithImage` component.
*   We include an `Image` component from Chakra UI to display the image. We set `boxSize` and `objectFit` to control the image's size and how it's displayed within its container.  `mb={2}` adds a little margin to the bottom.
*   We use `display="flex"`, `flexDirection="column"`, and `alignItems="center"` on the `Box` to center the image and text within the card.

This allows you to create visually rich Radio Card components that are both informative and engaging.  Remember to optimize your images for web performance!

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is a key principle of Chakra UI, and the Radio Card component is designed with accessibility in mind. Here are some important considerations:

*   **Use the `useRadio` hook:** This hook handles the necessary ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for accessibility. *Never* build a custom radio component without it.
*   **Ensure proper labeling:**  Use the `children` prop of the `Radio` component to provide clear and concise labels for each option.  The custom radio card renders this within a `<label>` tag, associating it with the hidden input.
*   **Provide sufficient contrast:** Ensure that the text and background colors have sufficient contrast to meet accessibility guidelines (WCAG).  Chakra UI's color palette helps with this.
*   **Focus state:**  Make sure the focus state is clearly visible when a radio card is focused (using the `_focus` pseudo-selector).  This is important for keyboard users.

By following these guidelines, you can create accessible Radio Card implementations that are usable by everyone, including users with disabilities.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices for using the Radio Card component effectively:

*   **Use Radio Cards for mutually exclusive options:** Radio buttons (and Radio Cards) are best suited for scenarios where the user needs to select only one option from a set of choices.
*   **Keep labels concise and descriptive:**  Clear and concise labels make it easy for users to understand the options and make informed decisions.
*   **Consider the visual hierarchy:** Use visual cues (such as color, size, and spacing) to highlight the most important options and guide the user's attention.
*   **Test on different devices and screen sizes:** Ensure that the Radio Card component renders correctly and is usable on different devices and screen sizes.  Chakra UI's responsive styles make this easier.
*   **Think about keyboard navigation:** Test with a keyboard to make sure users can easily navigate between options using the tab key and select an option using the spacebar.  The `useRadio` hook handles this automatically.

## Conclusion

The Radio Card component in Chakra UI is a powerful and versatile tool for creating accessible and user-friendly forms and interfaces. By understanding its basic usage, advanced customization options, and accessibility considerations, you can effectively leverage this component to enhance the user experience of your React applications. Remember to always prioritize accessibility and follow best practices to ensure that your Radio Card implementations are usable by everyone.  The `useRadio` hook is your friend!
