# CSS Grid `place-self`: Mastering Alignment and Justification within Grid Items

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that offers unparalleled control over the placement of elements on a webpage. While properties like `place-items` and `place-content` affect the entire grid container, `place-self` provides granular control at the individual grid item level. This blog post dives deep into the `place-self` property, exploring its syntax, use cases, and how it empowers you to create more sophisticated and responsive layouts.

## What is `place-self`?

The `place-self` property in CSS Grid allows you to control the alignment and justification of a specific grid item within its assigned grid area. It's a shorthand property that combines the functionalities of `align-self` and `justify-self`. Think of it as a way to override the container-level alignment settings defined by `place-items` for a single element.

## Syntax of `place-self`

The `place-self` property accepts one or two values, corresponding to the `align-self` and `justify-self` properties, respectively. Here's the breakdown:

```plaintext
/* Single value: Applies to both align-self and justify-self */
place-self: stretch;
place-self: center;
place-self: start;
place-self: end;
place-self: self-start;
place-self: self-end;
place-self: normal; /* Initial Value */

/* Two values: First value is align-self, second is justify-self */
place-self: start end; /* Align to top, justify to right */
place-self: center center; /* Both horizontally and vertically centered */
place-self: stretch start; /* Stretch vertically, align to left */
```

- **`align-self`**: Controls the vertical alignment of the grid item within its grid area. Possible values include:

  - `stretch`: Stretches the item to fill the entire height of its grid area.
  - `center`: Centers the item vertically within its grid area.
  - `start`: Aligns the item to the top of its grid area.
  - `end`: Aligns the item to the bottom of its grid area.
  - `self-start`: Aligns the item to the start edge of its alignment container within its grid area. This is often the same as `start`, but can differ in more complex layouts with writing-mode or direction settings.
  - `self-end`: Aligns the item to the end edge of its alignment container within its grid area. Similar to `self-start`, but aligns to the end.
  - `normal`: Behaves like `stretch` if the grid track's size is 'auto' and as `start` otherwise. This is the initial value.

- **`justify-self`**: Controls the horizontal alignment of the grid item within its grid area. Possible values are the same as `align-self`:
  - `stretch`: Stretches the item to fill the entire width of its grid area.
  - `center`: Centers the item horizontally within its grid area.
  - `start`: Aligns the item to the left of its grid area.
  - `end`: Aligns the item to the right of its grid area.
  - `self-start`: Aligns the item to the start edge of its alignment container within its grid area. This is often the same as `start`, but can differ in more complex layouts with writing-mode or direction settings.
  - `self-end`: Aligns the item to the end edge of its alignment container within its grid area. Similar to `self-start`, but aligns to the end.
  - `normal`: Behaves like `stretch` if the grid track's size is 'auto' and as `start` otherwise. This is the initial value.

**Important Note:** When only one value is provided to `place-self`, it applies to _both_ `align-self` and `justify-self`.

## Practical Examples of `place-self`

Let's illustrate the power of `place-self` with several practical examples.

**Example 1: Centering a Single Item**

Suppose you have a grid with multiple items, but you want one specific item to be centered both horizontally and vertically within its cell.

```plaintext
<div class="grid-container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div class="centered-item">Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```plaintext
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* Two equal columns */
  grid-gap: 10px;
  height: 300px; /* Define a height for visualization */
}

.centered-item {
  place-self: center;
  background-color: lightblue; /* For better visibility */
}
```

In this example, `.centered-item` will be perfectly centered within its grid cell, regardless of the other items' alignment.

**Example 2: Aligning to Top-Right**

Imagine you need a specific grid item to be positioned at the top-right corner of its cell.

```plaintext
<div class="grid-container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div class="top-right-item">Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```plaintext
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
  height: 300px;
}

.top-right-item {
  place-self: start end; /* Top (align-self: start), Right (justify-self: end) */
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

Here, the `top-right-item` will be aligned to the top and right edges of its assigned grid area.

**Example 3: Stretching Vertically, Aligning to Left**

Sometimes, you might need an item to stretch vertically but remain aligned to the left horizontally.

```plaintext
<div class="grid-container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div class="stretch-left-item">Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```plaintext
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
  height: 300px;
}

.stretch-left-item {
  place-self: stretch start; /* Stretch (align-self: stretch), Left (justify-self: start) */
  background-color: orange;
}
```

In this case, the `stretch-left-item` will span the entire height of its grid cell while maintaining its left alignment.

**Example 4: Overriding `place-items`**

Let's say your grid container uses `place-items: center` to center all items by default, but you want to specifically align one item to the top-left.

```plaintext
<div class="grid-container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div class="override-item">Item 3</div>
  <div>Item 4</div>
</div>
```

```plaintext
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
  height: 300px;
  place-items: center; /* Centers all items by default */
}

.override-item {
  place-self: start start; /* Overrides the container's centering, aligns to top-left */
  background-color: pink;
}
```

The `override-item` will be aligned to the top-left, ignoring the container's `place-items: center` setting, showcasing the overriding power of `place-self`.

## When to Use `place-self`

`place-self` is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **Fine-grained Control:** When you need to adjust the alignment of specific grid items independently of the overall grid layout.
- **Overriding Default Alignment:** When you want to override the `place-items` setting for particular elements.
- **Creating Complex Layouts:** For designing intricate layouts where individual elements require unique positioning within the grid.
- **Responsive Design:** `place-self` can be combined with media queries to dynamically adjust the alignment of elements based on screen size.

## Best Practices for Using `place-self`

- **Understand the Grid Context:** Before using `place-self`, make sure you have a solid understanding of the grid container's properties, such as `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `place-items`.
- **Use Meaningful Class Names:** Use descriptive class names for grid items to clearly indicate their purpose and alignment (e.g., `.centered-item`, `.top-right-item`).
- **Prioritize Container-Level Alignment:** Whenever possible, try to achieve the desired layout using container-level properties like `place-items` and `place-content` first. Use `place-self` only when individual item adjustments are necessary.
- **Combine with Media Queries:** Leverage media queries to adapt the alignment of grid items based on different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design.
- **Consider Accessibility:** Ensure that the alignment choices made with `place-self` do not negatively impact the accessibility of your website.
