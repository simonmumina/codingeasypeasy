# Auditing FastAPI Applications for OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities: A Comprehensive Guide

FastAPI has rapidly become a popular framework for building APIs in Python, thanks to its speed, ease of use, and automatic data validation. However, like any web application framework, FastAPI applications are susceptible to vulnerabilities.  The OWASP Top 10 list represents the most critical security risks to web applications.  This guide provides a practical approach to auditing your FastAPI applications for these common vulnerabilities, along with code examples and remediation strategies.

## Understanding the OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a frequently updated list of the most critical web application security risks. While the specific risks and their ranking may change over time, the underlying principles remain relevant.  Here's a brief overview of the 2023 OWASP Top 10:

1.  **Broken Access Control:** Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced.
2.  **Cryptographic Failures:**  Sensitive data is not adequately protected.
3.  **Injection:**  Malicious code or data is injected into an application through user input.
4.  **Insecure Design:** Flaws in the application's architecture and design.
5.  **Security Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured security settings.
6.  **Vulnerable and Outdated Components:** Using outdated or vulnerable libraries and frameworks.
7.  **Identification and Authentication Failures:** Problems with user authentication and session management.
8.  **Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Flaws related to code integrity and data validation.
9.  **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:** Insufficient logging and monitoring of security events.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  An attacker can make the server perform requests to unintended locations.

## Setting Up Your FastAPI Application for Auditing

Before you begin auditing, ensure you have a FastAPI application to work with.  Here's a basic example:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None

items = {}

@app.post("/items/{item_id}")
async def create_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    if item_id in items:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Item ID already exists")
    items[item_id] = item
    return item

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id not in items:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    return items[item_id]

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
  if item_id not in items:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
  items[item_id] = item
  return items[item_id]

```

Now, let's examine how to audit this application, and other FastAPI apps, for the OWASP Top 10.

## Auditing for OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities in FastAPI

### 1. Broken Access Control

**The Risk:**  Users can access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to.

**FastAPI Specifics:**  FastAPI itself doesn't handle authentication or authorization directly. You'll need to implement these mechanisms using libraries like `python-jose` for JWT or `fastapi-users`.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Code Review:** Examine your route definitions and middleware to ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place. Look for missing or flawed access control logic.
*   **Testing:** Create test cases with different user roles and permissions to verify that only authorized users can access specific endpoints and data. Try to bypass access controls by manipulating request headers or parameters.

**Code Example (Authorization with Dependencies):**

```python
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from typing import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")


async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    # Replace this with your actual user authentication logic
    if token == "fake_token":  # Simplified example
        return {"username": "admin"}
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid authentication credentials")


async def get_current_active_user(current_user: Annotated[dict, Depends(get_current_user)]):
    if current_user is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Inactive user")
    return current_user

@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(current_user: Annotated[dict, Depends(get_current_active_user)]):
    return [{"name": "Example Item"}]

```

**Remediation:**

*   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0).
*   Enforce proper authorization checks on every route and function based on user roles and permissions.
*   Use role-based access control (RBAC) where appropriate.
*   Principle of Least Privilege:  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.

### 2. Cryptographic Failures

**The Risk:**  Sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal information) is not adequately protected, leading to exposure.

**FastAPI Specifics:**  FastAPI doesn't handle cryptography directly, but it's crucial to use proper cryptographic practices in your application.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Code Review:**  Check how sensitive data is stored, transmitted, and handled. Ensure you're using strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices. Look for hardcoded secrets.
*   **Configuration Review:**  Verify that TLS/SSL is properly configured for HTTPS communication.

**Code Example (Password Hashing):**

```python
import bcrypt

def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    return hashed_password.decode('utf-8')

def verify_password(password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password.encode('utf-8'))

# Usage
password = "my_secret_password"
hashed = hash_password(password)
print(f"Hashed password: {hashed}")

is_valid = verify_password(password, hashed)
print(f"Password is valid: {is_valid}")
```

**Remediation:**

*   Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (e.g., using TLS/SSL for HTTPS).
*   Store cryptographic keys securely (e.g., using a hardware security module or a secrets management service).
*   Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily.

### 3. Injection

**The Risk:**  An attacker injects malicious code or data into the application, causing it to execute unintended commands or reveal sensitive information.  Common types include SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**FastAPI Specifics:** FastAPI's data validation capabilities help mitigate injection risks but don't eliminate them entirely.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Code Review:**  Examine how user input is handled and processed. Look for places where user input is directly used in SQL queries, system commands, or rendered into HTML without proper sanitization.
*   **Testing:**  Try to inject malicious code or data into input fields and parameters.  Use fuzzing tools to automatically test for injection vulnerabilities.

**Code Example (SQL Injection Prevention - Using ORM):**

Instead of directly constructing SQL queries with user input, use an ORM like SQLAlchemy:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, declarative_base
from pydantic import BaseModel

DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"  # Example SQLite database

engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

Base = declarative_base()

class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = "items"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, index=True)
    description = Column(String, nullable=True)


Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

app = FastAPI()

class ItemCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None


@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: ItemCreate):
    db = SessionLocal()
    db_item = Item(name=item.name, description=item.description)
    db.add(db_item)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_item)
    db.close()
    return db_item

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
  db = SessionLocal()
  item = db.query(Item).filter(Item.id == item_id).first()
  db.close()
  if item is None:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
  return item
```

**Remediation:**

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate all user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and types. Sanitize input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters. FastAPI's Pydantic models are excellent for input validation.
*   **Parameterized Queries or ORM:**  Use parameterized queries or an ORM (like SQLAlchemy) to prevent SQL injection.  These methods automatically escape user input before incorporating it into SQL queries.
*   **Output Encoding:**  Encode output when rendering user-provided data in HTML to prevent XSS.
*   **Avoid Using `eval()`:**  Never use the `eval()` function with user-supplied data, as it can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load, mitigating XSS attacks.

### 4. Insecure Design

**The Risk:**  Fundamental flaws in the application's architecture, design, or security controls that create vulnerabilities.  This is a broad category that can encompass many other OWASP Top 10 risks.

**FastAPI Specifics:**  Focus on designing your API with security in mind from the start.  Consider security requirements early in the development process.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential threats to your application and assess the likelihood and impact of each threat.
*   **Architecture Review:**  Review the overall architecture of your application to identify potential design flaws. Consider authentication, authorization, data validation, error handling, and logging.
*   **Security Requirements Analysis:**  Ensure that security requirements are clearly defined and documented.

**Remediation:**

*   **Secure Design Principles:**  Follow secure design principles, such as least privilege, defense in depth, and separation of concerns.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Conduct threat modeling to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   **Security Architecture Review:**  Perform a security architecture review to identify potential design flaws.
*   **Consult Security Experts:**  Consult with security experts to review your application's design and provide recommendations for improvement.

### 5. Security Misconfiguration

**The Risk:**  Incorrectly configured security settings that leave the application vulnerable to attack.

**FastAPI Specifics:** This includes misconfigured servers, databases, and frameworks.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Configuration Review:** Review all configuration files for potential security weaknesses, including database credentials, API keys, and error handling settings.
*   **Default Credentials:**  Ensure that all default passwords and configurations have been changed.
*   **Error Handling:**  Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

**Remediation:**

*   **Harden Server Configuration:**  Follow security hardening guidelines for your web server, database server, and operating system.
*   **Secure Default Settings:**  Change all default passwords and configurations.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable any unnecessary features or services that could be exploited.
*   **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep your software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Use Secrets Management:**  Store sensitive credentials and API keys securely using a secrets management service.
*   **Proper Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling to prevent the exposure of sensitive information. Use custom error pages and logging.

### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

**The Risk:** Using outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries, frameworks, and other components.

**FastAPI Specifics:**  Keep your FastAPI dependencies up-to-date, including FastAPI itself, Pydantic, and any other packages you use.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Dependency Scanning:**  Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use an SCA tool for more comprehensive vulnerability detection and license compliance management.

**Code Example (Using `pip-audit`):**

```bash
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
```

This command will analyze your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` and report any vulnerabilities found in your dependencies.

**Remediation:**

*   **Dependency Updates:**  Regularly update your project's dependencies to the latest versions.
*   **Automated Dependency Scanning:**  Integrate dependency scanning into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities.
*   **Vendor Monitoring:**  Subscribe to security advisories from the vendors of your third-party components.

### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures

**The Risk:**  Flaws in the authentication and session management mechanisms that allow attackers to impersonate users or gain unauthorized access.

**FastAPI Specifics:** Properly implement user authentication, session management, and account recovery mechanisms.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Code Review:**  Examine your authentication and session management code for weaknesses such as weak password storage, predictable session IDs, or lack of proper session expiration.
*   **Testing:**  Attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms, brute-force passwords, and hijack sessions.

**Code Example (Using JWT with `python-jose`):**

```python
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from typing import Annotated

SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"  # Change this to a strong, randomly generated secret
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta | None = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)  # Default expiration
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt


async def get_current_user(token: Annotated[str, Depends(oauth2_scheme)]):
    credentials_exception = HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Could not validate credentials",
        headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
    )
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        if username is None:
            raise credentials_exception
        # You would typically fetch the user from your database here
        # For this example, we'll just return the username
        user = {"username": username}  # Replace with your user retrieval logic
        if user is None:
            raise credentials_exception
        return user
    except jwt.PyJWTError:
        raise credentials_exception

```

**Remediation:**

*   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for increased security.
*   **Secure Session Management:**  Use secure session management techniques, such as generating strong, random session IDs, setting appropriate session expiration times, and protecting session cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Account Lockout:**  Implement account lockout policies to prevent attackers from repeatedly attempting to guess passwords.
*   **Secure Password Reset:**  Use secure password reset mechanisms that require users to verify their identity.

### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures

**The Risk:**  Flaws related to code integrity and data validation that can lead to unreliable software or data corruption. This can include issues like improper data deserialization or reliance on untrusted sources for updates.

**FastAPI Specifics:**  Use Pydantic models to enforce strict data validation and consider signing or hashing critical code and configuration files to detect tampering.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Code Review:**  Examine how data is serialized and deserialized.  Look for potential vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization.
*   **Data Validation:**  Ensure that data is properly validated before being processed or stored.
*   **Integrity Checks:**  Implement integrity checks to verify that code and data have not been tampered with.

**Remediation:**

*   **Strict Data Validation:**  Use strong data validation techniques to ensure that data is valid before being processed or stored.  Pydantic is very useful for this in FastAPI.
*   **Code Signing:** Sign your code to verify its authenticity.
*   **Secure Deserialization:** Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. If you must deserialize data from an untrusted source, use a secure deserialization library.
*   **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep your software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Input Validation:** Use Pydantic models for strict input validation, ensuring that data conforms to the expected schema and types.
*   **Limit Deserialization:**  Restrict the types and complexity of data that can be deserialized to minimize the attack surface.

### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**The Risk:**  Insufficient logging and monitoring of security events that make it difficult to detect and respond to attacks.

**FastAPI Specifics:**  Implement comprehensive logging to capture important security-related events, such as authentication failures, authorization violations, and suspicious activity.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Log Review:** Review your application's logs to ensure that security-related events are being logged adequately.
*   **Monitoring:**  Set up monitoring to detect suspicious activity and alert you to potential security incidents.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop an incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively.

**Code Example (Logging with `logging` module):**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) # Configure basic logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@app.get("/log_example")
async def log_example():
    logger.info("This is an informational message.")
    logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
    logger.error("This is an error message.")
    return {"message": "Logs written"}

```

**Remediation:**

*   **Comprehensive Logging:**  Log all important security-related events, including authentication attempts, authorization decisions, input validation failures, and exceptions.
*   **Centralized Logging:**  Centralize your logs in a secure location for easier analysis and monitoring.
*   **Real-Time Monitoring:**  Implement real-time monitoring to detect suspicious activity and alert you to potential security incidents.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify you when specific security events occur.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively.
*   **Automated Analysis:**  Use security information and event management (SIEM) systems or other tools to automate log analysis and identify potential threats.

### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**The Risk:**  An attacker can make the server perform requests to unintended locations, potentially accessing internal resources or performing actions on behalf of the server.

**FastAPI Specifics:** Carefully validate and sanitize any URLs provided by users that are used in server-side requests.

**Auditing Techniques:**

*   **Code Review:** Examine any code that makes outbound HTTP requests based on user input. Look for missing or inadequate URL validation.
*   **Testing:** Try to make the server request internal resources or external URLs that it shouldn't be able to access.

**Code Example (Preventing SSRF):**

```python
import httpx
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["example.com", "trusteddomain.net"]

@app.get("/proxy")
async def proxy(url: str):
    """Proxies the request to the given URL, but only if it's in the ALLOWED_HOSTS."""

    try:
        parsed_url = httpx.URL(url)
        if parsed_url.host not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid URL: Host not allowed.")

        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            return response.content, response.status_code, response.headers.items()

    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

**Remediation:**

*   **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all URLs provided by users to ensure they are safe.
*   **Whitelist Allowed Hosts:**  Maintain a whitelist of allowed hosts that the server is permitted to access.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Protocols:**  Disable any unnecessary protocols, such as `file://` or `gopher://`, that could be used to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Segment your network to limit the impact of an SSRF attack.
*   **Use a Proxy:** Use a forward proxy server to make outbound requests from the server, which can help to prevent SSRF attacks.
