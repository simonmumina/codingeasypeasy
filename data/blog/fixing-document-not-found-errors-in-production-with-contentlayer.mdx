# Fixing "Document Not Found" Errors in Production with Contentlayer

Encountering a "Document Not Found" error in your production environment is a frustrating experience, especially when you're relying on Contentlayer to manage your content.  These errors can manifest as broken links, missing pages, or unexpected 404s, impacting user experience and SEO. This article will guide you through understanding, debugging, and ultimately resolving these errors when using Contentlayer with Next.js (or a similar framework).

## Understanding the Problem: Why "Document Not Found"?

A "Document Not Found" error in the context of Contentlayer generally means that your application is trying to access a document that Contentlayer either hasn't processed correctly or is unable to locate within your defined content sources.  This can stem from various causes:

*   **Content Layer Misconfiguration:** The most fundamental cause.  Your `contentlayer.config.ts` (or `.js`) might be incorrectly configured, preventing Contentlayer from properly indexing your content files.  This includes incorrect `contentDirPath`, `contentType`, or faulty field definitions.
*   **Content Mismatch:** The structure or content within your markdown or MDX files might not align with the schema defined in your Contentlayer configuration. For example, a required field might be missing in a particular content file.
*   **Inconsistent Casing/File Naming:**  Operating systems have varying levels of case sensitivity. Discrepancies between the case of filenames (e.g., `MyPost.mdx` vs. `mypost.mdx`) and the paths used in your application's code can lead to "Document Not Found" errors, especially in production environments where casing is strictly enforced.
*   **Build Issues:** Sometimes, Contentlayer fails to generate the necessary TypeScript files during the build process. This can happen due to issues with your build scripts, environment variables, or Contentlayer itself.
*   **Cache Problems:**  Outdated or corrupted cache data can lead to your application referencing old paths or content structures.  This is particularly relevant when deploying updates to your content.
*   **Deployment Issues:** Problems during deployment, such as files not being properly copied to the production server or incorrect server configurations, can obviously lead to "Document Not Found" errors.
*   **Dynamic Routing Errors:** In Next.js, incorrectly configured dynamic routes or issues with the `getStaticPaths` function can result in Contentlayer not finding the correct documents for a given route.
*   **Missing Content:**  The simplest case - the content file itself might have been accidentally deleted or moved in your content directory.

## Debugging Strategies: Hunting Down the Culprit

Here's a systematic approach to debugging "Document Not Found" errors with Contentlayer:

1.  **Inspect Your Contentlayer Configuration (`contentlayer.config.ts`):**

    *   **`contentDirPath`:** Double-check that the `contentDirPath` in your `contentlayer.config.ts` points to the correct directory where your content files are located.
    *   **`contentType`:** Ensure that the `contentType` (e.g., `Post`, `Page`) accurately reflects the type of content you're defining.
    *   **Field Definitions:** Verify that the fields you're defining in your Contentlayer schema match the actual fields present in your markdown/MDX files. Are all required fields present? Are the types correct?

    ```typescript
    // contentlayer.config.ts
    import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'

    const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
      name: 'Post',
      filePathPattern: `**/*.mdx`,
      contentType: 'mdx',
      fields: {
        title: {
          type: 'string',
          description: 'The title of the post',
          required: true,
        },
        date: {
          type: 'date',
          description: 'The date of the post',
          required: true,
        },
        description: {
          type: 'string',
          description: 'A short description of the post',
          required: true,
        },
      },
      computedFields: {
        url: {
          type: 'string',
          resolve: (post) => `/blog/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`,
        },
      },
    }))

    export default makeSource({
      contentDirPath: 'content', // <--- CHECK THIS!
      documentTypes: [Post],
    })
    ```

2.  **Validate Your Content Files:**

    *   **Schema Compliance:** Make sure all your markdown/MDX files conform to the schema defined in your `contentlayer.config.ts`.  Run a script to validate your content files against the Contentlayer schema.  You can adapt the following script to your needs:

    ```javascript
    // validateContent.js (example)
    import { allPosts } from '.contentlayer/generated'; // Adjust import path

    const validatePosts = () => {
      let hasErrors = false;

      allPosts.forEach(post => {
        if (!post.title) {
          console.error(`Error: Post "${post._id}" is missing a title.`);
          hasErrors = true;
        }
        if (!post.date) {
            console.error(`Error: Post "${post._id}" is missing a date.`);
            hasErrors = true;
          }
          // Add more validations for other fields as needed
      });

      if (hasErrors) {
        console.error("Content validation failed.  Please fix the errors above.");
        process.exit(1); // Exit with an error code
      } else {
        console.log("Content validation passed!");
      }
    };

    validatePosts();
    ```

    Add this script to your `package.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "validate-content": "node validateContent.js"
      }
    }
    ```

    And run: `npm run validate-content`

    *   **File Paths:**  Carefully examine the file paths used to access your content within your application's code. Ensure they exactly match the paths generated by Contentlayer, considering the `contentDirPath` and any computed fields like `url`.

    *   **Frontmatter Errors:**  Typos or incorrect syntax in your frontmatter can cause Contentlayer to fail to parse the file.  Use a linter for YAML/TOML frontmatter if possible.

3.  **Inspect the `.contentlayer/generated` directory:**

    *   This directory contains the TypeScript files generated by Contentlayer. Inspect these files to see how Contentlayer is interpreting your content. Look for any obvious discrepancies between your content files and the generated TypeScript types. If files are missing, this is a strong indicator of an issue in your `contentlayer.config.ts` or with your content files.

4.  **Check Your Build Process:**

    *   **Contentlayer CLI:** Ensure you're running the Contentlayer CLI as part of your build process. This usually involves a command like `contentlayer build` or `contentlayer make` in your `package.json` scripts.

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "contentlayer build && next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "next lint"
      }
    }
    ```

    *   **Environment Variables:** If your Contentlayer configuration relies on environment variables, verify that these variables are correctly set in your production environment.

    *   **Cache Busting:** Try clearing your Next.js cache and rebuilding your application.  Use commands like `npm run build --force` or `yarn build --force`. Consider also deleting the `.next` folder.
    *   **Dependencies:**  Ensure your Contentlayer and Next.js versions are compatible and up-to-date.  Outdated dependencies can sometimes cause unexpected errors.

5.  **Investigate Dynamic Routes (Next.js):**

    *   **`getStaticPaths`:** If you're using dynamic routes, meticulously examine your `getStaticPaths` function. Ensure it's correctly fetching all your content IDs from Contentlayer and generating the correct paths.  A common error is failing to include all possible paths, causing "Document Not Found" errors for certain pages.

    ```typescript
    // pages/blog/[slug].tsx (example)
    import { allPosts } from '.contentlayer/generated';
    import { useMDXComponent } from 'next-contentlayer/hooks';
    import { GetStaticPaths, GetStaticProps } from 'next';

    export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
      const paths = allPosts.map((post) => ({ params: { slug: post._raw.flattenedPath } }));
      return {
        paths,
        fallback: false, // or 'blocking'
      };
    };

    export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
      const post = allPosts.find((post) => post._raw.flattenedPath === params?.slug);

      if (!post) {
        return {
          notFound: true, // Handle the "Document Not Found" gracefully!
        };
      }

      return {
        props: {
          post,
        },
      };
    };

    const PostPage = ({ post }) => {
      const MDXContent = useMDXComponent(post.body.code);

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{post.title}</h1>
          <MDXContent />
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default PostPage;
    ```

    *   **`getStaticProps`:** In `getStaticProps`, make sure you're handling the case where the document is not found.  The example above shows how to use `notFound: true` to return a 404 page.

6.  **Check Server Logs:**

    *   Examine your production server logs for any error messages related to Contentlayer or file access. These logs can provide valuable clues about the root cause of the problem.

7.  **Deployment Validation:**

    *   **File Integrity:** After deploying your application, verify that all your content files have been successfully transferred to the production server and that their file paths are correct.  Tools like `rsync` have options for verifying file integrity after transfer.
    *   **Server Configuration:** Ensure that your server is configured to correctly serve static files, including your markdown/MDX files.  This might involve checking your web server configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or your hosting provider's settings.

## Preventative Measures: Avoiding "Document Not Found" Errors

Proactive measures can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering these errors in the first place:

*   **Content Validation:** Implement a robust content validation process as part of your development workflow.  This involves running scripts to automatically check your content files against your Contentlayer schema before deploying to production.
*   **Consistent File Naming:** Enforce a consistent file naming convention (e.g., lowercase with hyphens) to avoid case sensitivity issues.
*   **Automated Testing:**  Write automated tests to verify that all your content pages are accessible and that links between pages are working correctly.
*   **Deployment Pipeline:**  Establish a reliable deployment pipeline that includes steps to clear caches, rebuild your application, and verify file integrity after deployment.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting to detect "Document Not Found" errors in your production environment and notify you immediately when they occur.  Tools like Sentry or Rollbar can be helpful.
*   **Version Control:**  Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to your content files and Contentlayer configuration. This allows you to easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

## Example:  Fixing a Common Misconfiguration

Let's say you're getting "Document Not Found" errors for your blog posts.  After inspecting your `contentlayer.config.ts`, you realize that the `filePathPattern` for your `Post` document type is incorrect:

```typescript
// Incorrect contentlayer.config.ts
const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  filePathPattern: `posts/*.mdx`, // Incorrect!
  // ... rest of the config
}));
```

Your content files are actually located directly in the `content` directory, not in a subdirectory called `posts`.  The fix is to update the `filePathPattern`:

```typescript
// Corrected contentlayer.config.ts
const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  filePathPattern: `*.mdx`, // Correct!
  // ... rest of the config
}));
```

After making this change, rebuild your application (`npm run build`) and deploy to production. The "Document Not Found" errors should be resolved.

## Conclusion

"Document Not Found" errors in Contentlayer can be tricky to debug, but by following a systematic approach and understanding the common causes, you can effectively resolve these issues and ensure a smooth content delivery experience for your users. Remember to focus on configuration, content validation, and robust testing to prevent these errors from occurring in the first place.  By incorporating these best practices into your development workflow, you can build a more reliable and maintainable content-driven application.
