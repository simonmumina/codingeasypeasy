## Getting Started

### Installation

First, install the `expo-image-manipulator` package using `expo install`:

```bash
expo install expo-image-manipulator
```

You might also need to install `expo-image-picker` if you plan on letting users select images from their device's gallery or camera.

```bash
expo install expo-image-picker
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to load an image and display it after performing a simple resize:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Image } from 'react-native';
import * as ImageManipulator from 'expo-image-manipulator';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

export default function App() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const pickImage = async () => {
      // No permissions request is necessary for launching the image library
      let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
        mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.All,
        allowsEditing: true,
        aspect: [4, 3],
        quality: 1,
      });

      console.log(result);

      if (!result.canceled) {
        const manipulatedImage = await ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(
          result.assets[0].uri,
          [
            { resize: { width: 200, height: 150 } }, // Resize to 200x150
          ],
          { compress: 0.8, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG } // Adjust compression and format
        );

        setImage(manipulatedImage.uri);
      }
    };

    pickImage(); // Call pickImage function when the component mounts. Comment out if you don't want it to immediately open.
  }, []);


  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Edited Image</Text>
      {image && <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Statements:** Import the necessary modules from React Native, `expo-image-manipulator`, and `expo-image-picker`.
2.  **`pickImage` Function:**  This asynchronous function handles the image selection process:
    *   It launches the device's image library using `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync`.
    *   If an image is selected (not canceled), it uses `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync` to:
        *   Resize the image to a width of 200 and height of 150 pixels.
        *   Compress the image to 80% quality in JPEG format.
    *   The URI of the manipulated image is then stored in the `image` state variable.
3.  **`useEffect` Hook:** The `useEffect` hook runs only once when the component mounts.  It calls the `pickImage` function.  Comment out the `pickImage()` call if you don't want the image picker to open automatically.  You can trigger it with a button press instead.
4.  **Rendering:** The component renders a `View` containing a `Text` element and an `Image` component. The `Image` component displays the manipulated image using the URI stored in the `image` state.

## Image Manipulation Options

The `manipulateAsync` function takes three arguments:

*   **`uri`:** The URI of the image you want to manipulate.  This can be a local file path, a remote URL, or a data URI.
*   **`actions`:** An array of manipulation actions to perform.  Each action is an object describing a transformation.
*   **`options`:** An optional object specifying the save format and compression quality.

### Resizing

The `resize` action allows you to change the dimensions of the image. You can specify the width, height, or both. If you only specify one dimension, the other dimension will be scaled proportionally.

```javascript
{ resize: { width: 300 } } // Resize to a width of 300, maintaining aspect ratio
{ resize: { height: 200 } } // Resize to a height of 200, maintaining aspect ratio
{ resize: { width: 300, height: 200 } } // Resize to 300x200
```

### Cropping

The `crop` action allows you to select a specific region of the image. You need to specify the origin (x, y) and the size (width, height) of the crop area.

```javascript
{
  crop: {
    originX: 50, // X coordinate of the top-left corner
    originY: 25, // Y coordinate of the top-left corner
    width: 150,  // Width of the crop area
    height: 100, // Height of the crop area
  },
}
```

### Rotating

The `rotate` action allows you to rotate the image by a specified angle in degrees.

```javascript
{ rotate: 90 }  // Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
{ rotate: -45 } // Rotate 45 degrees counter-clockwise
```

### Flipping

The `flip` action allows you to flip the image horizontally or vertically.

```javascript
{ flip: ImageManipulator.FlipType.Horizontal } // Flip horizontally
{ flip: ImageManipulator.FlipType.Vertical }   // Flip vertically
```

### Combining Manipulations

You can combine multiple manipulation actions in a single call to `manipulateAsync`. This is more efficient than calling `manipulateAsync` multiple times.

```javascript
const manipulatedImage = await ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(
  imageUri,
  [
    { resize: { width: 400 } },
    { rotate: 90 },
    { crop: { originX: 20, originY: 20, width: 360, height: 360 } },
  ],
  { compress: 0.7, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG }
);
```

In this example, the image is first resized to a width of 400, then rotated by 90 degrees, and finally cropped to a square area.

### Save Options

The `options` argument of `manipulateAsync` allows you to control the save format and compression quality of the manipulated image.

*   **`format`:** Specifies the save format. Possible values are `ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG`, `ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.PNG`, and `ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.WEBP`.
*   **`compress`:**  Specifies the compression quality. A value of 1 means no compression (best quality), while a value of 0 means maximum compression (lowest quality). Values are between 0 and 1.
*   **`base64`:**  If set to `true`, the function will return the image as a Base64 encoded string instead of a URI.

```javascript
{ compress: 0.8, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG } // Compress to 80% quality in JPEG format
{ format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.PNG, base64: true } // Save as PNG and return a Base64 string
```

## Example: Implementing a Simple Image Editor

Let's create a simple image editor that allows the user to select an image, rotate it, and then display the rotated image.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Image, Button } from 'react-native';
import * as ImageManipulator from 'expo-image-manipulator';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

export default function App() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState(null);
  const [rotation, setRotation] = useState(0);

  const pickImage = async () => {
    let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.All,
      allowsEditing: true,
      aspect: [4, 3],
      quality: 1,
    });

    if (!result.canceled) {
      setImage(result.assets[0].uri);
    }
  };

  const rotateImage = async () => {
    if (image) {
      const newRotation = rotation + 90;
      const manipulatedImage = await ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(
        image,
        [{ rotate: newRotation }],
        { compress: 1, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG }
      );
      setImage(manipulatedImage.uri);
      setRotation(newRotation);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Pick an image from camera roll" onPress={pickImage} />
      {image && (
        <>
          <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
          <Button title="Rotate Image" onPress={rotateImage} />
        </>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **State Variables:** `image` stores the URI of the selected and manipulated image.  `rotation` stores the current rotation angle.
2.  **`pickImage` Function:**  Opens the image library and sets the selected image's URI in the `image` state.
3.  **`rotateImage` Function:**
    *   Calculates the new rotation angle (adding 90 degrees to the current rotation).
    *   Uses `ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync` to rotate the image by the new angle.
    *   Updates the `image` state with the URI of the rotated image.
    *   Updates the `rotation` state with the new rotation angle.
4.  **Rendering:**
    *   A button to pick an image.
    *   If an image is selected, it displays the image and a button to rotate it.

## Best Practices

*   **Optimize Image Sizes:** Before manipulating images, consider their original size.  Large images can consume a lot of memory and processing power. You might want to resize them before applying other transformations.
*   **Compress Images:** Use appropriate compression levels to reduce file sizes without sacrificing too much quality. Experiment to find the best balance for your application.
*   **Error Handling:** Always handle potential errors during image manipulation, such as invalid image URIs or insufficient storage space.
*   **Background Processing:** For complex image manipulations, consider using background processing to avoid blocking the main thread and freezing the UI.  Libraries like `expo-background-fetch` or `expo-task-manager` can be useful for this.
*   **Caching:**  Cache manipulated images to avoid re-processing them unnecessarily.  You can use the `expo-file-system` to store the manipulated images locally.
