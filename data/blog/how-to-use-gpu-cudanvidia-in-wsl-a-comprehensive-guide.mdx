# How to Use GPU (CUDA/NVIDIA) in WSL: A Comprehensive Guide

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has become a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to run Linux distributions alongside Windows. But what if you want to leverage the power of your NVIDIA GPU within WSL for tasks like machine learning, deep learning, or other computationally intensive applications? This guide will walk you through the process of setting up CUDA and utilizing your NVIDIA GPU inside WSL.

## Why Use GPU in WSL?

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand the benefits:

- **Performance:** Offload compute-intensive tasks to your dedicated NVIDIA GPU, significantly speeding up execution compared to CPU-only computations.
- **Development Environment:** Develop and test GPU-accelerated applications in a familiar Linux environment directly on your Windows machine.
- **Access to Linux Tools:** Utilize powerful Linux-specific libraries and tools optimized for GPU processing.
- **Unified Workflow:** Streamline your workflow by eliminating the need for dual-booting or separate VMs for GPU development.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **Windows 10 version 2004 (Build 19041) or higher** or **Windows 11**. You can check your Windows version by pressing `Win + R`, typing `winver`, and pressing Enter.
- **A supported NVIDIA GPU with drivers installed on your Windows host.** You can download the latest drivers from the NVIDIA website. Make sure you select the "Game Ready Driver" or "Studio Driver," either will work.
- **WSL 2 installed and running.** If you haven't installed WSL 2 yet, follow the official Microsoft documentation: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- **An Ubuntu (or other compatible Linux distribution) installed through WSL 2.** This guide will focus on Ubuntu.

## Step 1: Ensure Your NVIDIA Driver is Compatible

This is **crucial**. You need to have the _latest_ NVIDIA drivers installed on your Windows host machine for WSL GPU passthrough to work. Outdated drivers are the most common cause of problems. Download the latest drivers directly from NVIDIA's website: [https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us). Remember to choose the correct GPU and operating system. After downloading, install the driver and reboot your system.

## Step 2: Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit Inside WSL

The NVIDIA Container Toolkit provides the necessary runtime components to allow WSL to access and utilize the NVIDIA GPU. Open your WSL terminal (Ubuntu).

1.  **Update the package list:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary packages:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
    ```

3.  **Add the NVIDIA package repository:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring.pub | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cuda-archive-keyring.gpg] https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64 /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cuda-ubuntu2204.list
    ```

    **Important:** Replace `ubuntu2204` with the correct Ubuntu version code name (e.g., `ubuntu2004`, `ubuntu1804`) if you are not using Ubuntu 22.04. You can find your Ubuntu version by running `lsb_release -a`.

4.  **Update the package list again:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    ```

5.  **Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
    ```

    This command installs all necessary dependencies and configures the container runtime to utilize the NVIDIA GPU.

## Step 3: Verify the Installation

After installing the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, it's important to verify that your WSL environment can correctly detect and access the GPU.

1.  **Run `nvidia-smi`:**

    ```plaintext
    nvidia-smi
    ```

    If the installation was successful, you should see information about your NVIDIA GPU, including its model, driver version, and current usage. If you encounter an error like "nvidia-smi: command not found", double-check that you installed the `nvidia-container-toolkit` correctly, and reboot your WSL instance (either by closing and reopening the terminal, or running `wsl --shutdown` in PowerShell and then restarting your WSL distribution).

## Step 4: Install CUDA Toolkit Inside WSL (Optional, But Recommended)

While the NVIDIA Container Toolkit allows you to run GPU-accelerated applications, you'll often need the CUDA Toolkit to compile and develop applications that leverage CUDA. If you only plan on _running_ pre-compiled CUDA applications, you can skip this step.

1.  **Download the CUDA Toolkit installer:**

    Visit the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit download page ([https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)). Select "Linux" -> "x86*64" -> \_your Ubuntu version* -> "deb (network)" and follow the instructions provided to download and install the CUDA Toolkit. This usually involves running a series of commands similar to the ones used to add the NVIDIA repository in the previous steps:

    ```plaintext
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2204.pin
    sudo mv cuda-ubuntu2204.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.4.2/local_installers/cuda_12.4.2_550.67_linux.deb
    sudo dpkg -i cuda_12.4.2_550.67_linux.deb
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install cuda
    ```

    **Important:** Make sure to select the correct distribution and architecture for your WSL environment. Also, replace `12.4.2` with the desired CUDA Toolkit version. It's often best to install the _latest stable_ version. Check the NVIDIA CUDA downloads page for the latest version.

2.  **Set environment variables:**

    After installing the CUDA Toolkit, you need to set the necessary environment variables so that your system can find the CUDA libraries and executables. Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file (depending on your shell):

    ```plaintext
    export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
    export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

    You can open the file with `nano ~/.bashrc` (or `nano ~/.zshrc`) and add the lines at the end of the file. Save the file and exit.

3.  **Apply the changes:**

    To apply the changes to your current session, run:

    ```plaintext
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    or

    ```plaintext
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

4.  **Verify the CUDA installation:**

    Run the `nvcc --version` command. This should print the CUDA compiler version, confirming that the CUDA Toolkit is correctly installed. If you get an error, double-check your environment variables and ensure the CUDA Toolkit is properly installed.

## Step 5: Test Your GPU Installation with a Sample Application

Now that you have CUDA installed, let's test your GPU setup with a simple CUDA application. We'll use the classic `deviceQuery` sample.

1.  **Navigate to the CUDA samples directory:**

    ```plaintext
    cd /usr/local/cuda/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
    ```

2.  **Compile the `deviceQuery` sample:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo make
    ```

3.  **Run the compiled executable:**

    ```plaintext
    ./deviceQuery
    ```

    This will output information about your CUDA-enabled device, including its name, CUDA capability, and memory. If you see "Result = PASS," your GPU is successfully configured and ready for use!

## Example: Running a TensorFlow GPU Example

Let's try a simple example using TensorFlow to verify GPU acceleration. First, install TensorFlow with GPU support inside your WSL environment:

```plaintext
pip install tensorflow
```

Now, create a Python script named `tensorflow_gpu_test.py` with the following code:

```plaintext
import tensorflow as tf

# Check if a GPU is available
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
    print("GPU is available and being used by TensorFlow!")
    # Create a simple TensorFlow operation that uses the GPU
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')
    b = tf.constant([7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print("Result of matrix multiplication:")
    print(c)
else:
    print("No GPU detected. TensorFlow will run on CPU.")
```

Run the script:

```plaintext
python tensorflow_gpu_test.py
```

If the GPU is correctly configured, you should see "GPU is available and being used by TensorFlow!" and the result of the matrix multiplication. If it falls back to the CPU, double-check your CUDA and TensorFlow installations.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **`nvidia-smi` not found:** This usually means the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is not installed correctly, or the PATH environment variable is not set properly. Double-check the installation steps and ensure the `/usr/lib/nvidia-container-toolkit` directory is in your PATH. Restart your WSL session after making changes.
- **`CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version`:** This means your NVIDIA driver on the Windows host is older than the CUDA Toolkit version you installed inside WSL. Update your NVIDIA drivers on Windows.
- **TensorFlow or other libraries not recognizing the GPU:** Ensure that the correct CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN versions are installed and compatible with your TensorFlow version. Use `pip show tensorflow` to check the TensorFlow version and consult the TensorFlow documentation for compatible CUDA/cuDNN versions.
- **General Performance Issues:** Ensure that you're using WSL 2, not WSL 1. WSL 2 provides significantly better performance for GPU-accelerated workloads. Also, close any unnecessary applications running on Windows that might be competing for GPU resources.

## Conclusion

Using GPU in WSL opens up a world of possibilities for developers and researchers. By following these steps, you can unlock the power of your NVIDIA GPU within your Linux environment on Windows, enabling you to develop and run high-performance applications with ease. Remember to keep your NVIDIA drivers updated and ensure compatibility between CUDA, cuDNN, and your chosen frameworks for optimal performance. Good luck!
