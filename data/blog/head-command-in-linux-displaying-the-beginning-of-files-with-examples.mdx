# Head Command in Linux: Displaying the Beginning of Files with Examples

The `head` command is a fundamental utility in Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems) used to display the beginning of a file. It's a quick and easy way to preview the contents of a file without having to open it in a text editor or scroll through its entire length. This blog post will dive deep into the `head` command, exploring its various options and providing practical examples to help you master its usage.

## What is the `head` command?

The `head` command takes a file name as input and prints the first few lines of that file to the standard output (usually your terminal). By default, it displays the first 10 lines. This is useful for quickly checking file headers, configuration files, or logs to get a general idea of their content or to verify their structure.

## Basic Usage

The simplest form of the `head` command is:

```plaintext
head filename
```

This command will display the first 10 lines of the specified `filename`.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a file named `my_log_file.txt` with the following content:

```
Log entry 1: System started
Log entry 2: User login successful
Log entry 3: Processing data
Log entry 4: Database connection established
Log entry 5: Error occurred: File not found
Log entry 6: Warning: Low disk space
Log entry 7: User logged out
Log entry 8: System shutdown initiated
Log entry 9: Network connectivity lost
Log entry 10: Rebooting system
Log entry 11: Kernel loaded successfully
Log entry 12: Initializing hardware
```

Running the command:

```plaintext
head my_log_file.txt
```

Will produce the following output:

```
Log entry 1: System started
Log entry 2: User login successful
Log entry 3: Processing data
Log entry 4: Database connection established
Log entry 5: Error occurred: File not found
Log entry 6: Warning: Low disk space
Log entry 7: User logged out
Log entry 8: System shutdown initiated
Log entry 9: Network connectivity lost
Log entry 10: Rebooting system
```

As you can see, the first 10 lines of the file are displayed.

## Specifying the Number of Lines

You can customize the number of lines displayed using the `-n` (or `--lines`) option. This allows you to specify the exact number of lines you want to see.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
head -n [number_of_lines] filename
```

**Example:**

To display only the first 5 lines of `my_log_file.txt`, you would use:

```plaintext
head -n 5 my_log_file.txt
```

Or, using the long option:

```plaintext
head --lines=5 my_log_file.txt
```

Both commands will output:

```
Log entry 1: System started
Log entry 2: User login successful
Log entry 3: Processing data
Log entry 4: Database connection established
Log entry 5: Error occurred: File not found
```

You can also use a shorter form:

```plaintext
head -5 my_log_file.txt
```

This is equivalent to `head -n 5 my_log_file.txt`.

## Displaying All But the Last Few Lines

Instead of displaying the _first_ N lines, you can tell `head` to display all lines _except_ the last N lines. This is done by providing a negative number to the `-n` option.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
head -n -[number_of_lines] filename
```

**Example:**

To display all lines of `my_log_file.txt` except the last 2 lines, you would use:

```plaintext
head -n -2 my_log_file.txt
```

Or the equivalent short version:

```plaintext
head -n -2 my_log_file.txt
```

This will output:

```
Log entry 1: System started
Log entry 2: User login successful
Log entry 3: Processing data
Log entry 4: Database connection established
Log entry 5: Error occurred: File not found
Log entry 6: Warning: Low disk space
Log entry 7: User logged out
Log entry 8: System shutdown initiated
Log entry 9: Network connectivity lost
Log entry 10: Rebooting system
```

Notice that "Log entry 11" and "Log entry 12" are not displayed.

## Displaying the First Few Bytes

The `head` command can also display the first few bytes of a file using the `-c` (or `--bytes`) option. This is useful when dealing with binary files or when you only need to see a specific portion of the beginning of a file.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
head -c [number_of_bytes] filename
```

**Example:**

To display the first 20 bytes of `my_log_file.txt`, you would use:

```plaintext
head -c 20 my_log_file.txt
```

Or the long option:

```plaintext
head --bytes=20 my_log_file.txt
```

The output will be the first 20 bytes of the file, which in this case would be:

```
Log entry 1: Syste
```

Like with lines, you can also tell `head` to print all but the last N bytes.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
head -c -[number_of_bytes] filename
```

**Example:**

To display all but the last 20 bytes of `my_log_file.txt`, you would use:

```plaintext
head -c -20 my_log_file.txt
```

This will output all the content of the file, excluding the last 20 bytes.

## Working with Multiple Files

The `head` command can handle multiple files at once. When you provide multiple file names as arguments, `head` will display the beginning of each file, with a header indicating which file is being displayed.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
head filename1 filename2 filename3 ...
```

**Example:**

Let's say you have two files: `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.

`file1.txt` contains:

```
This is the first line of file1.txt
This is the second line of file1.txt
This is the third line of file1.txt
```

`file2.txt` contains:

```
This is the first line of file2.txt
This is the second line of file2.txt
This is the third line of file2.txt
This is the fourth line of file2.txt
```

Running the command:

```plaintext
head file1.txt file2.txt
```

Will produce the following output:

```
==> file1.txt <==
This is the first line of file1.txt
This is the second line of file1.txt
This is the third line of file1.txt

==> file2.txt <==
This is the first line of file2.txt
This is the second line of file2.txt
This is the third line of file2.txt
This is the fourth line of file2.txt
```

Notice the `==> filename <==` headers indicating the source of the displayed lines.

If you don't want these headers to be displayed, you can use the `-q` (or `--quiet`, `--silent`) option.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
head -q filename1 filename2 filename3 ...
```

Using the same files as the previous example, the command:

```plaintext
head -q file1.txt file2.txt
```

Will produce:

```
This is the first line of file1.txt
This is the second line of file1.txt
This is the third line of file1.txt
This is the first line of file2.txt
This is the second line of file2.txt
This is the third line of file2.txt
This is the fourth line of file2.txt
```

## Combining `head` with Other Commands using Pipes

The `head` command is often used in combination with other command-line tools using pipes (`|`). This allows you to process the output of one command and then display only the first few lines of the result. This is a powerful technique for filtering and analyzing data.

**Example:**

To list all files in the current directory and display only the first 5 file names, you can use:

```plaintext
ls | head -n 5
```

This command first uses `ls` to list all files and directories in the current directory. The output of `ls` is then piped to the `head` command, which displays the first 5 lines (which correspond to the first 5 file names).

Another example:

```plaintext
cat large_file.txt | grep "error" | head -n 10
```

This command first uses `cat` to read the entire contents of `large_file.txt`. The output is then piped to `grep "error"`, which filters the lines, only including lines that contain the string "error". Finally, the output of `grep` is piped to `head -n 10`, which displays the first 10 lines containing "error". This is useful for finding the first few error messages in a large log file.

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common scenarios where the `head` command proves useful:

- **Previewing log files:** Quickly check the latest entries in a log file to identify errors or warnings.
- **Examining configuration files:** Verify the settings in a configuration file without opening it in a text editor.
- **Extracting data from files:** Isolate the first few lines of a data file for analysis or processing.
- **Filtering output from other commands:** Combine `head` with other commands using pipes to extract specific information.
- **Verifying file formats:** Check the header of a file to identify its format or encoding.

## Conclusion

The `head` command is a simple yet powerful tool for quickly displaying the beginning of files in Linux. By understanding its various options and how to combine it with other commands, you can significantly improve your command-line efficiency and productivity. Mastering `head`, along with other basic Linux commands, is essential for any system administrator, developer, or anyone working with the command line. Experiment with the examples provided in this guide to further solidify your understanding and unlock the full potential of this valuable utility.
