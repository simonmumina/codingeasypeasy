# Secure WebSocket Endpoints with Authentication in FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide

WebSockets provide real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server, making them ideal for applications like chat applications, live dashboards, and online games.  Securing these WebSocket connections with proper authentication is crucial to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on how to implement authentication for WebSocket endpoints in FastAPI, ensuring secure and robust real-time communication.

## Why Authenticate WebSocket Endpoints?

Without authentication, anyone can connect to your WebSocket endpoint and potentially access or manipulate data. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can establish a connection and interact with the server. This is essential for:

*   **Protecting sensitive data:** Preventing unauthorized access to real-time data streams.
*   **Controlling access:** Granting access to specific WebSocket features or data based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Preventing abuse:** Limiting the potential for malicious actors to overload the server or disrupt the service.
*   **Auditing and logging:** Tracking user activity and identifying potential security threats.

## Authentication Methods for FastAPI WebSockets

Several authentication methods can be used with FastAPI WebSockets, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.  We'll explore the most common and effective techniques:

1.  **JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication:**  A popular and widely adopted standard for representing claims securely between two parties.
2.  **OAuth2 (Authorization Framework):**  A framework that allows users to grant limited access to their resources on one site to another site without sharing their credentials.
3.  **Custom Authentication with API Keys or Tokens:**  Implement your own authentication logic using API keys or other custom tokens.

## 1. JWT Authentication for WebSockets

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  It's a common choice for authentication and authorization in web applications and works well with WebSockets.

**Workflow:**

1.  The client authenticates with the server using credentials (e.g., username and password).
2.  The server verifies the credentials and issues a JWT.
3.  The client stores the JWT (usually in local storage or cookies).
4.  When establishing a WebSocket connection, the client includes the JWT in the connection URL (as a query parameter) or in the `Authorization` header of the initial HTTP handshake.
5.  The server validates the JWT to authenticate the user.

**Code Example:**

First, let's set up the JWT creation and verification.  This example assumes you have a standard FastAPI application with a user authentication system.

```python
from typing import Optional

from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from jose import JWTError, jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

# Replace with your actual secret key
SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")  # Use "token" endpoint for OAuth2 flow

def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: Optional[timedelta] = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt


def verify_token(token: str):
  """Verifies a JWT token and returns the user data if valid."""
  try:
      payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
      username: str = payload.get("sub")  # Assuming "sub" claim contains the username
      if username is None:
          raise HTTPException(
              status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
              detail="Could not validate credentials",
              headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
          )
      return username # returns the user
  except JWTError:
      raise HTTPException(
          status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
          detail="Could not validate credentials",
          headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
      )



async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    """Dependency to get the current user from a JWT token."""
    try:
        username = verify_token(token)
        # In a real application, you would fetch the user from the database
        # based on the username.  For this example, we'll just return the username.
        return {"username": username}
    except HTTPException as e:
        raise e  # Re-raise the exception to be handled by FastAPI

```

Now, let's implement the WebSocket endpoint that authenticates using the JWT token:

```python
from fastapi import WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect, Depends, Query
from typing import Annotated

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(
    websocket: WebSocket,
    token: Annotated[str, Query()]
):
    try:
        username = verify_token(token) # Authenticate the user
    except HTTPException:
        await websocket.close(code=status.WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION)  #Close connection immediately.
        return

    await websocket.accept()
    print(f"WebSocket connection established for user: {username}")  # Log the user

    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            await websocket.send_text(f"You said: {data}")
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        print(f"WebSocket disconnected for user: {username}")
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`@app.websocket("/ws")`:** Defines the WebSocket endpoint at the `/ws` path.
*   **`token: Annotated[str, Query()]`:**  Extracts the `token` from the query parameters of the WebSocket URL (e.g., `ws://example.com/ws?token=YOUR_JWT`).  We use Annotated from the `typing` module to allow for more verbose dependency injection. `Query()` specifies that the token should come from the query parameters.
*   **`verify_token(token)`:** Verifies the JWT using the `verify_token` function.  If the token is invalid, it raises an `HTTPException`.
*   **`await websocket.accept()`:** Accepts the WebSocket connection.
*   The `try...except` block handles incoming messages and disconnections.  It echoes back the received data to the client.
*   **`status.WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION`**: The websocket connection is closed by the server with a status of 1008.  This indicates that the server is terminating the connection due to a policy violation during the initial handshake (JWT validation in our case).

**Client-Side Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
const token = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"; // Replace with the actual JWT
const socket = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8000/ws?token=${token}`);

socket.onopen = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket connection established.");
    socket.send("Hello, WebSocket!");
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log("Received:", event.data);
};

socket.onclose = (event) => {
    console.log("WebSocket connection closed.", event);
};

socket.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
};
```

**Important Considerations for JWTs:**

*   **Secret Key Security:**  Keep your `SECRET_KEY` extremely secure.  Never expose it in your code or commit it to your repository. Use environment variables to store it.
*   **Token Expiration:**  Set a reasonable expiration time for your JWTs to limit the impact of compromised tokens.
*   **Token Storage:**  Store JWTs securely on the client-side.  Avoid storing them in local storage for highly sensitive applications as they are susceptible to XSS attacks. Consider using HttpOnly cookies.
*   **Refresh Tokens:** Implement a refresh token mechanism to allow clients to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating.
*   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for WebSocket connections (WSS) to encrypt the traffic and prevent eavesdropping.

## 2. OAuth2 Authentication for WebSockets

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

While direct OAuth2 integration into WebSockets is less common, you can leverage OAuth2 to obtain an access token, which can then be used for JWT-based authentication as described above.

**Workflow:**

1.  The client authenticates with an OAuth2 provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, or your own OAuth2 server) and obtains an access token.
2.  The client includes the access token in the WebSocket connection URL or header (similar to JWT).
3.  The server validates the access token against the OAuth2 provider.
4.  If the token is valid, the server establishes the WebSocket connection and grants access based on the user's permissions.

**FastAPI OAuth2 Setup (Simplified Example):**

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from datetime import timedelta
# Import the functions and variables we defined in the previous JWT example
from .your_jwt_module import create_access_token, verify_token, get_current_user  # Replace with your actual module
from typing import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

# Replace with your actual authentication logic (e.g., database lookup)
fake_users_db = {
    "johndoe": {"username": "johndoe", "password": "password123"}
}


async def authenticate_user(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm):
    user = fake_users_db.get(form_data.username)
    if not user or user["password"] != form_data.password:  # Replace with proper password hashing
        return False
    return user


@app.post("/token")
async def login_for_access_token(form_data: Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]):
    user = await authenticate_user(form_data)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Incorrect username or password",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
        )
    access_token_expires = timedelta(minutes=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES)
    access_token = create_access_token(
        data={"sub": user["username"]}, expires_delta=access_token_expires
    )
    return {"access_token": access_token, "token_type": "bearer"}


@app.get("/users/me")
async def read_users_me(current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return current_user

```

**Explanation:**

*   **`/token` Endpoint:** This endpoint handles the OAuth2 password grant flow. It receives the username and password, authenticates the user, and generates a JWT access token.
*   **`OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`:**  A class provided by FastAPI to handle the username and password data in the correct format.
*   **`authenticate_user`:**  A function that verifies the user's credentials (replace the fake database lookup with your actual authentication logic).
*   **`create_access_token`:**  The function we defined earlier to generate a JWT.

**WebSocket Endpoint (Using OAuth2 Access Token):**

The WebSocket endpoint remains similar to the JWT example. The client obtains the access token from the `/token` endpoint and passes it in the WebSocket URL:

```python
# Import the verify_token function from the previous JWT example.
from fastapi import WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect, Depends, Query
from typing import Annotated

@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(
    websocket: WebSocket,
    token: Annotated[str, Query()]
):
    try:
        username = verify_token(token) # Authenticate the user
    except HTTPException:
        await websocket.close(code=status.WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION)  #Close connection immediately.
        return

    await websocket.accept()
    print(f"WebSocket connection established for user: {username}")  # Log the user

    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            await websocket.send_text(f"You said: {data}")
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        print(f"WebSocket disconnected for user: {username}")
```

**Client-Side Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
// 1. Obtain an access token from the /token endpoint
//    (This requires making a POST request to the /token endpoint
//     with the username and password)

// Mock access token retrieval (replace with actual API call)
async function getAccessToken(username, password) {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/token", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  // Required by OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
        },
        body: new URLSearchParams({
            username: username,
            password: password
        })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    return data.access_token;
}



async function connectWebSocket() {
    const username = "johndoe"; // Example username
    const password = "password123"; // Example password

    const token = await getAccessToken(username, password); // Get the access token

    const socket = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8000/ws?token=${token}`);

    socket.onopen = () => {
        console.log("WebSocket connection established.");
        socket.send("Hello, WebSocket!");
    };

    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
        console.log("Received:", event.data);
    };

    socket.onclose = (event) => {
        console.log("WebSocket connection closed.", event);
    };

    socket.onerror = (error) => {
        console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
    };
}

connectWebSocket();  // Call the function to initiate the connection.
```

**Important Notes for OAuth2:**

*   **OAuth2 Provider:**  Choose a reputable OAuth2 provider or implement your own OAuth2 server.
*   **Scopes:**  Use scopes to limit the access granted to the client.
*   **Token Validation:**  Implement robust token validation to ensure that the access token is valid and not expired.

## 3. Custom Authentication with API Keys or Tokens

If you don't want to use JWT or OAuth2, you can implement your own custom authentication mechanism. This typically involves using API keys or other custom tokens to identify and authenticate users.

**Workflow:**

1.  The client requests an API key or token from the server (usually after registering or logging in).
2.  The server generates a unique API key or token and associates it with the user.
3.  The client includes the API key or token in the WebSocket connection URL or header.
4.  The server validates the API key or token against its database or other storage mechanism.
5.  If the token is valid, the server establishes the WebSocket connection and grants access based on the user's permissions.

**Code Example:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect, HTTPException, status, Query
from typing import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

# Replace with your actual API key storage (e.g., database)
api_keys = {
    "user1": "api_key_for_user1",
    "user2": "api_key_for_user2",
}


def verify_api_key(api_key: str):
    """Verifies an API key and returns the username if valid."""
    for username, key in api_keys.items():
        if key == api_key:
            return username
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Invalid API Key",
    )


@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(
    websocket: WebSocket,
    api_key: Annotated[str, Query()]
):
    try:
        username = verify_api_key(api_key)  # Authenticate the user
    except HTTPException:
        await websocket.close(code=status.WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION)
        return

    await websocket.accept()
    print(f"WebSocket connection established for user: {username}")

    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            await websocket.send_text(f"You said: {data}")
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        print(f"WebSocket disconnected for user: {username}")
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`api_keys`:**  A dictionary (replace with a database) that stores the API keys and associated usernames.
*   **`verify_api_key`:**  A function that checks if the provided API key exists in the `api_keys` dictionary.
*   The rest of the WebSocket endpoint logic is similar to the JWT example.

**Client-Side Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
const apiKey = "api_key_for_user1"; // Replace with the actual API key
const socket = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8000/ws?api_key=${apiKey}`);

socket.onopen = () => {
    console.log("WebSocket connection established.");
    socket.send("Hello, WebSocket!");
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log("Received:", event.data);
};

socket.onclose = (event) => {
    console.log("WebSocket connection closed.", event);
};

socket.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
};
```

**Important Notes for Custom Authentication:**

*   **API Key Generation:**  Generate strong, unique API keys.  Use cryptographically secure random number generators.
*   **Storage:**  Store API keys securely (e.g., hashed and salted in a database).
*   **Revocation:**  Implement a mechanism to revoke API keys if necessary.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Best Practices for WebSocket Authentication

Regardless of the authentication method you choose, follow these best practices to ensure the security of your WebSocket endpoints:

*   **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS (WSS) for WebSocket connections to encrypt the traffic.
*   **Input Validation:**  Validate all data received from the client to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Authorization:**  Implement authorization to control access to specific features and data based on user roles and permissions.  Authentication only verifies the user's identity; authorization determines what they are allowed to do.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  Log all authentication attempts and WebSocket activity to monitor for suspicious behavior.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep your FastAPI, dependencies, and authentication libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Connection Termination on Authentication Failure:**  Immediately close the WebSocket connection if authentication fails, preventing any further interaction. This is exemplified by the `await websocket.close(code=status.WS_1008_POLICY_VIOLATION)` line.

## Conclusion

Securing WebSocket endpoints with proper authentication is essential for protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access. This guide covered several authentication methods, including JWT, OAuth2, and custom API keys, along with practical code examples and best practices. By implementing these techniques, you can build secure and robust real-time applications with FastAPI WebSockets. Remember to choose the authentication method that best suits your application's requirements and prioritize security throughout the development process.
