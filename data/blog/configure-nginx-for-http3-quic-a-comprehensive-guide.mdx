# Configure Nginx for HTTP/3 (QUIC): A Comprehensive Guide

HTTP/3, built on top of the QUIC protocol, is the latest evolution of HTTP and offers significant improvements over its predecessors (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2). These improvements include reduced latency, better connection establishment times, and enhanced security. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough on how to configure Nginx to support HTTP/3 (QUIC).

## Why HTTP/3 (QUIC)?

Before diving into the configuration, let's understand why you should consider enabling HTTP/3:

*   **Reduced Latency:** QUIC uses UDP as its underlying transport protocol, which allows for faster connection establishment and fewer round trips compared to TCP used in HTTP/2. This leads to significantly lower latency, especially for mobile users and those with unreliable network connections.

*   **Improved Connection Establishment:**  QUIC combines TLS handshake and connection establishment, further reducing the time it takes to start transmitting data.

*   **Head-of-Line Blocking Mitigation:** QUIC solves the head-of-line blocking issue that plagues HTTP/2 over TCP. Packet loss in TCP blocks the entire connection, while QUIC can continue processing other streams even if one packet is lost.

*   **Enhanced Security:** QUIC mandates TLS 1.3, ensuring strong encryption and authentication.

*   **Connection Migration:** QUIC allows clients to switch networks (e.g., from WiFi to cellular) without interrupting the connection.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **Nginx:**  A working Nginx installation. It's recommended to use a recent version (ideally 1.25 or later, though the official QUIC module may require building from source depending on the Nginx version).  Verify your Nginx version using `nginx -v`.
*   **OpenSSL 1.1.1 or Later:** HTTP/3 requires TLS 1.3, which is supported by OpenSSL 1.1.1 and later. Check your OpenSSL version using `openssl version`.
*   **Root Access:** You'll need root privileges to modify Nginx configuration files.
*   **Domain Name and SSL Certificate:** You'll need a domain name and a valid SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is a popular and free option).

## Step 1: Install and Configure quiche (If Required)

For older Nginx versions, you may need to compile Nginx with the `ngx_http_quic_module` and `ngx_http_v3_module` from source. This involves using the `quiche` library, which provides the QUIC implementation. Newer versions of Nginx from the official mainline branch now include built-in support for HTTP/3, but building from source allows access to the latest features and bug fixes.

**A. Install Rust and Cargo (If Required):**

If you're building from source, you'll need Rust and Cargo, Rust's package manager.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

**B. Clone and Build quiche (If Required):**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche
cd quiche
cargo build --release
```

This will build the `libquiche.a` library in the `quiche/target/release` directory.

## Step 2: Build Nginx with HTTP/3 Modules (If Required)

If your Nginx distribution does not provide pre-built support for HTTP/3 (check your package manager or Nginx's documentation), you'll need to compile Nginx from source.

**A. Download Nginx Source Code:**

Download the latest stable Nginx source code from the official Nginx website ([https://nginx.org/en/download.html](https://nginx.org/en/download.html)).  For example:

```bash
wget https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.25.3.tar.gz
tar -xzvf nginx-1.25.3.tar.gz
cd nginx-1.25.3
```

**B. Configure Nginx with QUIC Modules:**

Now, configure the build with the `ngx_http_quic_module` and `ngx_http_v3_module`.  You'll also need to specify the path to your OpenSSL installation and the location of the `libquiche.a` library (if applicable).

```bash
./configure \
    --with-http_ssl_module \
    --with-http_v3_module \
    --with-http_quic_module \
    --with-openssl=/usr/local/openssl  \ # Adjust if your OpenSSL is in a different location
    --with-openssl-opt='enable-tls1_3' \ # Ensure TLS 1.3 is enabled
    --add-library=/path/to/quiche/target/release \ # Only if building against quiche
    --with-ld-opt="-L/path/to/quiche/target/release" # Only if building against quiche
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Adjust Paths:** Replace `/usr/local/openssl` with the correct path to your OpenSSL installation. This is often `/usr/lib/openssl` or `/usr/include/openssl`.  Similarly, replace `/path/to/quiche/target/release` with the actual path to the `libquiche.a` library you built earlier (if required).
*   **Dependencies:** You might need to install development packages for PCRE, zlib, and OpenSSL: `sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev` (on Debian/Ubuntu).
*   **`--with-debug`:** Add `--with-debug` if you're troubleshooting.

**C. Compile and Install Nginx:**

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

This will compile and install Nginx to its default location (usually `/usr/local/nginx`).

## Step 3: Configure Nginx for HTTP/3

Now, let's configure Nginx to enable HTTP/3. This involves modifying your Nginx configuration file (usually located in `/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`).

**A.  Update the `nginx.conf` File:**

1.  **Listen on UDP Port 443:**  Add a `listen` directive to your server block for UDP port 443.  This is essential for QUIC.
2.  **Enable HTTP/3:** Use the `http3` parameter in the `listen` directive.
3.  **Configure QUIC:** Add `quic_retry on;` to enable QUIC retry.  This mitigates amplification attacks.
4.  **TLS Configuration:** Ensure your TLS configuration (SSL certificate, SSL key, SSL protocols, and cipher suites) are properly configured.
5.  **Add `alt-svc` Header:** The `alt-svc` header tells clients that the server supports HTTP/3.

Here's an example configuration:

```nginx
http {
    # ... other configurations ...

    map $ssl_preread_server_name $upstream_name {
        example.com example_backend; # Replace with your actual backend name
    }

    upstream example_backend {
         server backend1.example.com:8080; # Replace with your backend servers
         server backend2.example.com:8080;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2; # Standard HTTPS
        listen 443 udp quic reuseport; # HTTP/3

        server_name example.com; # Replace with your domain

        ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.pem; # Replace with your certificate path
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;   # Replace with your private key path

        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH;

        quic_retry on;

        add_header Alt-Svc 'h3=":443"; ma=86400'; # Advertise HTTP/3

        # Proxy all requests to the backend servers
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://$upstream_name;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    # ... other configurations ...
}
```

**Important Notes:**

*   **`reuseport`:** The `reuseport` option improves performance by allowing multiple worker processes to listen on the same port.  This is recommended.
*   **Adjust Paths:** Replace `/path/to/your/certificate.pem` and `/path/to/your/private.key` with the actual paths to your SSL certificate and private key files.
*   **`Alt-Svc` Header:**  The `Alt-Svc` header is crucial. `h3=":443"; ma=86400` tells clients that HTTP/3 is available on port 443 for a maximum age of 86400 seconds (1 day). Adjust the `ma` (max-age) value as needed.
*  **Backend Proxy:**  The provided configuration demonstrates a simple proxy setup. Adjust the `proxy_pass` directive to point to your actual backend servers.
*   **Firewall Rules:** Ensure that your firewall allows UDP traffic on port 443.

**B.  Test the Configuration:**

Before restarting Nginx, test the configuration for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the configuration is valid, you'll see:

```
nginx: the configuration file /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf test is successful
```

**C.  Restart Nginx:**

Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```

Or, if you're starting Nginx for the first time:

```bash
sudo nginx
```

## Step 4: Verify HTTP/3 is Working

Now, let's verify that HTTP/3 is enabled and working correctly.

**A. Using a Browser with HTTP/3 Support:**

1.  **Chrome with QUIC Flag:** Chrome supports HTTP/3.  You can enable QUIC in Chrome by going to `chrome://flags` and searching for "Experimental QUIC protocol".  Enable the flag and restart Chrome.
2.  **Check Developer Tools:** Open Chrome's developer tools (Right-click -> Inspect -> Network tab).  Load your website.  Look for the "Protocol" column.  If HTTP/3 is working, you should see `h3-XX` (where XX is the draft version of HTTP/3, e.g., `h3-29`).  You may need to refresh the page multiple times, as the browser needs to discover HTTP/3 support through the `Alt-Svc` header.
3.  **Firefox (Requires Configuration):** Firefox also supports HTTP/3, but you might need to manually enable it by going to `about:config` and setting `network.http.http3.enabled` to `true`.  Like Chrome, check the developer tools (Network tab) after enabling it to confirm HTTP/3 is used (look for `h3` in the protocol column).

**B.  Using `curl`:**

You can use `curl` with the `--http3` option to verify HTTP/3.  However, you'll need a `curl` version that supports HTTP/3.  If your `curl` doesn't have `--http3`, you might need to compile it from source with HTTP/3 support.

```bash
curl -v --http3 https://example.com
```

Look for output indicating that HTTP/3 was used. The output should show negotiation with QUIC and HTTP/3.

**C. Online HTTP/3 Testing Tools:**

Several online tools can check if your website supports HTTP/3. Search for "HTTP/3 test" or "QUIC test" on the web.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Configuration Errors:** Double-check your Nginx configuration for syntax errors using `nginx -t`.  Pay close attention to the paths to your SSL certificate and private key.
*   **Firewall Issues:** Ensure that your firewall allows UDP traffic on port 443.
*   **SSL Certificate Problems:** Make sure your SSL certificate is valid and properly installed.  Let's Encrypt provides a free and easy way to obtain SSL certificates.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Not all browsers fully support HTTP/3.  Use a browser with HTTP/3 support and check the developer tools to verify that HTTP/3 is being used.
*   **QUIC Module Compatibility:**  Ensure that the `ngx_http_quic_module` and `ngx_http_v3_module` are compatible with your Nginx version and that you have correctly linked the `libquiche.a` library (if required).
*   **OpenSSL Version:** Ensure that you are using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later, which supports TLS 1.3.
*   **QUIC Retry:** If you have issues, try disabling `quic_retry off;` temporarily for testing, but re-enable it for production to prevent amplification attacks.

## Optimization Tips

*   **TLS 1.3:** Ensure that TLS 1.3 is enabled and prioritized in your SSL configuration.
*   **Cipher Suites:** Choose strong and modern cipher suites.
*   **HTTP/2 Fallback:** Keep HTTP/2 enabled as a fallback for clients that don't support HTTP/3.
*   **Monitor Performance:** Use tools like `tcpdump` or Wireshark to analyze network traffic and identify potential bottlenecks.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your Nginx, OpenSSL, and other dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
