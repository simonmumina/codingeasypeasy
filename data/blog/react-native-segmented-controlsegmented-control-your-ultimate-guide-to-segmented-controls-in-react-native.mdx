# @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control: Your Ultimate Guide to Segmented Controls in React Native

Segmented controls are a common UI element, especially on iOS, that allow users to select one option from a list of several mutually exclusive options. The `@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` library provides a cross-platform, easy-to-use implementation of this control for React Native, working seamlessly on both iOS and Android. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use this library effectively in your React Native projects.

## What is `@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control`?

`@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` is a React Native component that provides a native-looking segmented control on both iOS and Android. It aims to offer a consistent user experience across platforms with a simple and intuitive API. It handles platform-specific implementations internally, allowing developers to focus on the logic and styling of their applications. This library is a community maintained fork of the deprecated `react-native-segmented-control-tab` package.

## Why Use Segmented Controls?

Segmented controls offer several advantages in UI design:

- **Clear Visual Representation:** They clearly display available options, making it easy for users to understand their choices.
- **Direct Manipulation:** Users can directly select options without needing to navigate through menus or dropdowns.
- **Space Efficiency:** Segmented controls can efficiently display multiple options in a compact space.
- **Improved User Experience:** They contribute to a more intuitive and engaging user experience by offering immediate feedback.
- **Mobile Optimized:** They are particularly well-suited for mobile devices due to their ease of use on touchscreens.

## Installation

Getting started with `@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` is straightforward. Follow these steps:

**1. Install the Package:**

```plaintext
npm install @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control
# OR
yarn add @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control
```

**2. (Optional) Install and Configure `react-native-vector-icons`:**

If you plan to use icons within your segmented control (a common practice), you may want to install and configure `react-native-vector-icons`. This library provides a wide range of customizable icons.

```plaintext
npm install react-native-vector-icons
# OR
yarn add react-native-vector-icons
```

Follow the instructions for linking `react-native-vector-icons` for your specific platform in the [official documentation](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation). This often involves modifying your `android/app/build.gradle` file and your `ios/YourProjectName/Info.plist` file.

**3. (iOS Only) Pod Install:**

If you're building for iOS, navigate to your `ios` directory and run `pod install`:

```plaintext
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use `@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` in your React Native component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import SegmentedControl from '@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0)

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SegmentedControl
        values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}
        selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
        }}
      />
      <Text style={styles.text}>Selected Index: {selectedIndex}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
  },
  text: {
    marginTop: 10,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
})

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import SegmentedControl from '@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control';`**: Imports the SegmentedControl component.
- **`values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}`**: Defines the labels for each segment of the control. This is an array of strings.
- **`selectedIndex={selectedIndex}`**: Sets the index of the currently selected segment. We use a `useState` hook to manage this.
- **`onChange={(event) => { setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex); }}`**: A callback function that is called when the user selects a different segment. The `event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex` property provides the index of the newly selected segment.

## Styling and Customization

`@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` offers several props for styling and customization. You can control the appearance of the control to match your application's theme.

**Key Styling Props:**

- **`tintColor`**: Sets the color of the selected segment and the text color of the selected segment.

  ```jsx
  <SegmentedControl
    values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}
    selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
    onChange={(event) => {
      setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
    }}
    tintColor="purple"
  />
  ```

- **`backgroundColor`**: Sets the background color of the control.

  ```jsx
  <SegmentedControl
    values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}
    selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
    onChange={(event) => {
      setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
    }}
    backgroundColor="lightgray"
  />
  ```

- **`textColor`**: Sets the color of the unselected segment labels.

  ```jsx
  <SegmentedControl
    values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}
    selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
    onChange={(event) => {
      setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
    }}
    textColor="gray"
  />
  ```

- **`fontStyle`**: Sets the font style of the segment labels.
  ```jsx
  <SegmentedControl
    values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}
    selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
    onChange={(event) => {
      setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
    }}
    fontStyle={{ fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 16 }}
  />
  ```
- **`activeFontStyle`**: Sets the font style of the selected segment labels.
  ```jsx
  <SegmentedControl
    values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}
    selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
    onChange={(event) => {
      setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
    }}
    activeFontStyle={{ fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 18, color: 'white' }}
  />
  ```

**Example with Multiple Styling Props:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import SegmentedControl from '@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0)

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SegmentedControl
        values={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}
        selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
        }}
        tintColor="white"
        backgroundColor="blue"
        textColor="yellow"
        fontStyle={{ fontSize: 14, fontWeight: 'normal' }}
        activeFontStyle={{ fontSize: 16, fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'blue' }}
      />
      <Text style={styles.text}>Selected Index: {selectedIndex}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',
  },
  text: {
    marginTop: 10,
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'white',
  },
})

export default MyComponent
```

## Using Icons with Segmented Controls

While the `@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` package doesn't directly support icons as labels, you can achieve this by using a library like `react-native-vector-icons` and rendering custom components within the `values` array using text and icon combinations. This requires a bit more work but provides greater flexibility. Here's a conceptual example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import SegmentedControl from '@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control'
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/FontAwesome' // Example icon library

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0)

  //  Create an array of custom components for the segmented control
  const segmentLabels = [
    <View style={styles.segmentItem}>
      <Icon name="home" size={20} color="black" />
      <Text style={styles.segmentText}>Home</Text>
    </View>,
    <View style={styles.segmentItem}>
      <Icon name="search" size={20} color="black" />
      <Text style={styles.segmentText}>Search</Text>
    </View>,
    <View style={styles.segmentItem}>
      <Icon name="user" size={20} color="black" />
      <Text style={styles.segmentText}>Profile</Text>
    </View>,
  ]

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* NOTE: values prop expects string array only and can't accept custom components */}
      {/* You will need to adjust the rendering or consider a custom implementation of the segmented control */}

      {/* Example of how values prop is normally used*/}
      <SegmentedControl
        values={['Home', 'Search', 'Profile']}
        selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
        }}
      />

      {/* NOTE: This approach will not render custom views and requires a custom solution */}
      {/*<SegmentedControl
        values={segmentLabels}
        selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex);
        }}
       />*/}

      <Text style={styles.text}>Selected Index: {selectedIndex}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
  },
  text: {
    marginTop: 10,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
  segmentItem: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  segmentText: {
    marginLeft: 5,
  },
})

export default MyComponent
```

**Important Considerations for Icons:**

- **Custom Rendering:** The above example is _conceptual_. The `values` prop of `@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control` expects an array of _strings_. To render custom components (like the `segmentLabels`), you would need to create a custom implementation of the segmented control that handles the rendering of those components. This would involve more complex logic to handle touch events and visual updates.

- **Accessibility:** When using icons, ensure proper accessibility by providing appropriate `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` props to the elements containing the icons.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is crucial for making your application usable by everyone. Ensure your segmented controls are accessible by:

- **`accessibilityLabel`**: Provide a descriptive label for the entire control, explaining its purpose. Example: `accessibilityLabel="Filter articles by category"`.
- **`accessibilityHint`**: Provide a hint about what happens when an option is selected. Example: `accessibilityHint="Changes the displayed articles based on the selected category."`.

**Example with Accessibility:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import SegmentedControl from '@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0)

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SegmentedControl
        values={['Most Recent', 'Popular', 'Trending']}
        selectedIndex={selectedIndex}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setSelectedIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex)
        }}
        accessibilityLabel="Sort articles by:"
        accessibilityHint="Changes the order of displayed articles."
      />
      <Text style={styles.text}>Selected Index: {selectedIndex}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 20,
  },
  text: {
    marginTop: 10,
    fontSize: 16,
  },
})

export default MyComponent
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Labels Concise:** Segmented control labels should be short and easy to understand. Avoid lengthy descriptions.
- **Use Relevant Labels:** Choose labels that accurately reflect the options being presented.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Use segmented controls consistently throughout your application. If you use them for filtering in one section, consider using them similarly in other sections.
- **Provide Visual Feedback:** Ensure that the selected segment is clearly visually distinct from the unselected segments. The default styling usually handles this, but you might need to adjust it based on your application's theme.
- **Test on Different Devices:** Test your segmented controls on various devices and screen sizes to ensure they look and function correctly.
- **Consider Alternative UI Elements:** For complex or numerous options, consider alternative UI elements like dropdown menus or tabs, as segmented controls can become cluttered and difficult to use with too many segments.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Control Not Rendering:** Double-check that you have correctly installed the package and linked any necessary native dependencies (especially for `react-native-vector-icons`). Make sure you've run `pod install` for iOS.

- **Styling Not Applying:** Ensure you are using the correct prop names and values for styling. Remember that some styling options might be platform-specific.

- **Incorrect Segment Selected:** Verify that the `selectedIndex` prop is correctly updated when the user selects a segment. Check your `onChange` handler.

- **Performance Issues:** If you are rendering a large number of segments, optimize your code to prevent performance bottlenecks. Consider using virtualization techniques if necessary.
