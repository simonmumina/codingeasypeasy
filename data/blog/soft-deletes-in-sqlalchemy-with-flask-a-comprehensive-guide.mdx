# Soft Deletes in SQLAlchemy with Flask: A Comprehensive Guide

Data deletion is a crucial aspect of any application. While permanently deleting data might seem straightforward, it can lead to data loss and difficulty in auditing.  Soft deletes, on the other hand, offer a better approach by marking records as deleted without physically removing them from the database. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to implement soft deletes in a Flask application using SQLAlchemy, a powerful Python ORM.

## What are Soft Deletes?

Soft deletes involve adding a column (typically a boolean or timestamp) to your database tables to indicate whether a record is considered "deleted." Instead of running a `DELETE` SQL command, you update this column to signify that the record is no longer active. This allows you to:

*   **Recover Data:** Easily restore "deleted" records if needed.
*   **Maintain Audit Trails:** Track when and why data was "deleted."
*   **Preserve Relationships:** Avoid breaking relationships between tables when deleting related data.
*   **Improve Data Integrity:** Reduce the risk of accidentally losing important information.

## Implementing Soft Deletes with SQLAlchemy and Flask

Here are several approaches to implement soft deletes in your Flask application using SQLAlchemy. We'll cover using a mixin class, event listeners, and custom query objects.

### Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** (3.7 or higher recommended)
*   **Flask:**  `pip install Flask`
*   **SQLAlchemy:** `pip install SQLAlchemy`
*   **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** `pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy`

### 1. Setting up the Flask Application and SQLAlchemy

First, let's set up a basic Flask application with SQLAlchemy:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///:memory:'  # Use an in-memory database for simplicity
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False # Disable tracking modifications for performance
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Define a base model (optional, but good practice)
class Base(db.Model):
    __abstract__ = True
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=db.func.now())
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=db.func.now())


if __name__ == '__main__':
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all() # Create all the tables within the application context
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code initializes a Flask app and SQLAlchemy, connects to an in-memory SQLite database (for demonstration), and defines a base model class for common columns. The `db.create_all()` function creates the database tables based on your model definitions within the Flask application context.

### 2. Implementing Soft Deletes with a Mixin

A mixin class is a common and clean way to add soft delete functionality to your models.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Boolean, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.sql import func

class SoftDeleteMixin:
    deleted = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    deleted_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=True)

    def soft_delete(self):
        self.deleted = True
        self.deleted_at = func.now()  # Store the deletion timestamp
        db.session.add(self)
        db.session.commit() #Commit the transaction
```

This `SoftDeleteMixin` adds two columns: `deleted` (a boolean indicating if the record is deleted) and `deleted_at` (a timestamp recording when the record was deleted).  The `soft_delete` method sets these columns when you want to "delete" a record. It also adds the changes to the current SQLAlchemy session, which needs to be commited to the database.

Now, create a model that inherits from `Base` and `SoftDeleteMixin`:

```python
class User(Base, SoftDeleteMixin):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    username = Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<User {self.username}>'
```

This `User` model now has the `deleted` and `deleted_at` columns and the `soft_delete` method.

**Example Usage:**

```python
with app.app_context():
    # Create a user
    user = User(username='testuser', email='test@example.com')
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()

    # Soft delete the user
    user.soft_delete()
    print(f"User is deleted: {user.deleted}")  # Output: User is deleted: True

    # Try to query the user directly (you'll still find it)
    deleted_user = User.query.filter_by(username='testuser').first()
    print(deleted_user) # Output: <User testuser>
```

The problem with the above example is that `User.query.filter_by(username='testuser').first()` still returns the deleted user. We need to modify the queries to exclude deleted users by default.

### 3. Overriding the Query Object to Filter Deleted Records

To automatically exclude soft-deleted records from your queries, you can override the default `Query` object.  Create a custom `Query` class and use it when defining your base model:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Query

class SoftDeleteQuery(Query):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self._with_deleted = False
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def with_deleted(self):
        """Include soft deleted records in the query."""
        self._with_deleted = True
        return self

    def __iter__(self):
        """Override the iterator to filter results."""
        return Query.__iter__(self.without_deleted())

    def without_deleted(self):
        """Exclude soft deleted records from the query."""
        if self._with_deleted:
            return self

        # Assuming your model has a 'deleted' column, you might need to adapt this condition
        # for different implementations like 'deleted_at IS NOT NULL'
        clauses = []
        for entity in self.column_descriptions:
            if entity['entity'] is not None and hasattr(entity['entity'], 'deleted'):
                clauses.append(entity['entity'].deleted == False)

        if not clauses:
            return self

        return self.filter(*clauses)


# Modify the Base class to use the SoftDeleteQuery
class Base(db.Model):
    __abstract__ = True
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=db.func.now())
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=db.func.now())

    query_class = SoftDeleteQuery
```

Now, when you use `User.query`, it will automatically exclude soft-deleted records.  You can use the `with_deleted()` method on the query object to include deleted records if needed.

**Example Usage:**

```python
with app.app_context():
    # Create a user
    user = User(username='testuser', email='test@example.com')
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()

    # Soft delete the user
    user.soft_delete()

    # Query for the user (deleted user will not be returned)
    active_user = User.query.filter_by(username='testuser').first()
    print(active_user)  # Output: None

    # Query for the user including soft-deleted records
    deleted_user = User.query.with_deleted().filter_by(username='testuser').first()
    print(deleted_user)  # Output: <User testuser>
```

This approach ensures that your application code doesn't need to explicitly filter out deleted records in every query, reducing boilerplate and the risk of forgetting to apply the filter.

### 4. Implementing Soft Deletes with Event Listeners (Less Common)

While less common, you can also use SQLAlchemy event listeners to automatically handle soft deletes. This approach might be useful if you have a complex application with existing deletion logic.

```python
from sqlalchemy import event

@event.listens_for(User, 'before_delete')
def soft_delete_listener(mapper, connection, target):
    """Intercept the delete event and perform a soft delete."""
    target.deleted = True
    target.deleted_at = func.now()
    connection.execute(
        target.__table__.update().
        where(target.__table__.c.id == target.id).
        values(deleted=True, deleted_at=func.now())
    )
    # Prevent the actual deletion
    connection.execute("ROLLBACK")
```

**Explanation:**

*   `@event.listens_for(User, 'before_delete')`: This decorator registers the `soft_delete_listener` function to be executed *before* a `DELETE` statement is issued for the `User` model.
*   `target`:  This is the `User` instance being "deleted."
*   `connection`: This is the database connection being used.
*   The code updates the `deleted` and `deleted_at` columns of the `User` record to mark it as deleted.
*   `connection.execute("ROLLBACK")`: **Crucially**, this prevents the actual `DELETE` statement from being executed. The `ROLLBACK` effectively cancels the deletion, leaving the record in the database but marked as deleted.

**Important Considerations When Using Event Listeners:**

*   **ROLLBACK Caveats:**  The use of `ROLLBACK` is a bit of a hack. It prevents the actual delete, but it can interfere with other operations that might be happening in the same transaction.  It's generally better to manage transactions explicitly if you're using this approach. Consider using the session methods instead of direct connection manipulation.
*   **Maintenance:**  Event listeners can be harder to maintain and debug than mixins, especially as your application grows. The logic for soft deletion is hidden within the listener, making it less explicit.
*   **Session Awareness:** Event listeners often rely on the session being properly configured and available. Ensure the Flask application context is active when performing operations that trigger the event listener.

**Revised Event Listener Example (Using the Session)**

A better approach avoids the use of ROLLBACK and relies on SQLAlchemy's session management:

```python
from sqlalchemy import event
from flask import current_app

@event.listens_for(User, 'before_delete')
def soft_delete_listener(mapper, connection, target):
  """Intercept the delete event and perform a soft delete, using the session."""
  target.deleted = True
  target.deleted_at = func.now()

  # Add the modified target to the session
  db = current_app.extensions['sqlalchemy'].db # get the current db session
  db.session.add(target)

  # We *don't* rollback or delete! We simply modify the object and let SQLAlchemy handle the commit.
  # db.session.commit()  # Commit is usually handled elsewhere in the request cycle
```

In this revised version:

*   We get the SQLAlchemy `db` instance from the Flask application context using `current_app.extensions['sqlalchemy'].db`. This ensures we are using the correct session.
*   We add the modified `target` (the User object) to the session using `db.session.add(target)`. This tells SQLAlchemy that we want to persist the changes (setting `deleted = True` and `deleted_at`).
*   We **do not** explicitly `ROLLBACK` or `DELETE`. We simply modify the object and allow SQLAlchemy to handle the commit at the appropriate time (usually at the end of a request, or within a specific transaction block). This avoids conflicts with other database operations.

**Example Usage (with Event Listener):**

```python
with app.app_context():
    # Create a user
    user = User(username='testuser', email='test@example.com')
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()

    # Delete the user (this will trigger the event listener)
    db.session.delete(user)
    db.session.commit()

    # Query for the user (deleted user will not be returned by default, if using SoftDeleteQuery)
    active_user = User.query.filter_by(username='testuser').first()
    print(active_user)  # Output: None (if SoftDeleteQuery is in place)

    # Verify that the user is soft-deleted
    deleted_user = User.query.with_deleted().filter_by(username='testuser').first()
    print(deleted_user.deleted) # Output: True

```

**When to Use Event Listeners (and When Not To):**

*   **Use Event Listeners:**
    *   When you absolutely need to intercept the deletion process *before* it happens.
    *   When you are working with legacy code where modifying the models directly is difficult.
*   **Avoid Event Listeners:**
    *   When you have a simple application or can easily modify the model classes.
    *   When you want a clear and explicit implementation of soft deletes.
    *   When you need to manage transactions precisely.

### 5.  Adding Custom Manager for accessing soft deleted data (Advanced)

Another useful pattern is to add a custom Manager to the Model which can be used to easily access all, soft deleted and active data:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

class SoftDeleteManager:
    def __init__(self, session: Session, model):
        self.session = session
        self.model = model

    def all(self):
        return self.session.query(self.model)

    def active(self):
        return self.session.query(self.model).filter(self.model.deleted == False)

    def soft_deleted(self):
        return self.session.query(self.model).filter(self.model.deleted == True)

    def get(self, id: int):
        return self.session.get(self.model, id)


class Base(db.Model):
    __abstract__ = True
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=db.func.now())
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=db.func.now())

    def __init_subclass__(cls):
        super().__init_subclass__()
        # set the model_manager attribute
        cls.objects = SoftDeleteManager(db.session, cls)
```

**Example usage**
```python
with app.app_context():
    # Create a user
    user = User(username='testuser', email='test@example.com')
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()

    # Soft delete the user
    user.soft_delete()

    # Query for the user (deleted user will not be returned by default, if using SoftDeleteQuery)
    active_user = User.objects.active().filter_by(username='testuser').first()
    print(active_user)  # Output: None (if SoftDeleteQuery is in place)

    # Verify that the user is soft-deleted
    deleted_user = User.objects.soft_deleted().filter_by(username='testuser').first()
    print(deleted_user) # Output: <User testuser>
```

### Best Practices and Considerations

*   **Choose the Right Approach:**  For most cases, the mixin class and custom query object approach is the cleanest and most maintainable.  Event listeners should be used sparingly and with caution.
*   **Indexing:**  Consider adding an index to the `deleted` column to improve query performance when filtering on this column.
*   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation to prevent invalid data from being soft-deleted.
*   **Cascade Deletes:**  Carefully consider the implications of soft deletes on relationships between tables.  You might need to implement cascading soft deletes to maintain data integrity. For example if a `Blog` has many `Comments` and the `Blog` is soft deleted, the related comments should be soft deleted as well.
*   **Database Choice:** Soft deletes work well with most relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.).
*   **Documentation:**  Clearly document your soft delete implementation to ensure that other developers understand how to work with it.
*   **Testing:**  Write thorough unit tests to ensure that your soft delete implementation works correctly.  Test scenarios for creating, soft deleting, querying (both with and without deleted records), and restoring data.
*   **Consider Timestamps:** Instead of a boolean flag, a `deleted_at` timestamp column allows you to track *when* a record was deleted, providing valuable auditing information.
