# Vue.js Lifecycle Hooks: Created vs. Mounted - Understanding the Differences

Understanding the Vue.js component lifecycle is crucial for building robust and performant applications. Two of the most commonly used lifecycle hooks are `created` and `mounted`. While they might seem similar at first glance, they fire at different points in the component's initialization and have distinct use cases. This blog post dives deep into the differences between the `created` and `mounted` hooks in Vue.js, providing clarity on when to use each one and highlighting their respective strengths.

## What are Vue.js Lifecycle Hooks?

Before we delve into the specifics of `created` and `mounted`, let's briefly review what Vue.js lifecycle hooks are. These hooks are special functions that are executed at different stages of a component's lifespan. They provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points, such as initializing data, fetching data from an API, or manipulating the DOM. Think of them as checkpoints in a component's journey from creation to destruction.

## The `created` Hook: Initialization Before the DOM

The `created` hook is called **synchronously** after the component instance has been created. This means it's called immediately after the component's data observer, computed properties, methods, and watch callbacks have been set up. However, it's important to note that:

- **The DOM hasn't been mounted yet.** The component's template hasn't been rendered into the actual DOM. Therefore, you **cannot** directly access or manipulate DOM elements within the `created` hook. Trying to use `this.$el` or directly query the DOM will result in errors or unexpected behavior.
- **The template has been compiled.** Vue has already processed the template and is ready to render it.
- **Useful for initial data fetching and logic.** This hook is ideal for performing initial data fetching, setting up initial data values, and performing other logic that doesn't require DOM interaction.

Here's an example of how to use the `created` hook:

```plaintext
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Initial Message',
      apiData: null
    };
  },
  created() {
    console.log('Component created!');
    this.fetchData(); // Call a method to fetch data
  },
  methods: {
    async fetchData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        this.apiData = await response.json();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    }
  },
  template: `
    <div>
      <p>{{ message }}</p>
      <p v-if="apiData">Data from API: {{ apiData.name }}</p>
    </div>
  `
};
```

In this example, the `created` hook is used to:

1.  Log a message to the console to indicate that the component has been created.
2.  Call the `fetchData` method to retrieve data from an external API. This data is then stored in the `apiData` data property, which is subsequently used to render content in the template (conditionally, using `v-if`).

**Why use `created` for API calls?** Because you're initiating the data fetching process as early as possible in the component's lifecycle. This allows the component to start loading data before it's even rendered to the screen, leading to a smoother user experience.

## The `mounted` Hook: DOM is Ready!

The `mounted` hook is called after the component has been mounted to the DOM. This means:

- **The DOM is ready for interaction.** You can now access and manipulate DOM elements using `this.$el` or standard DOM APIs like `document.querySelector`.
- **All child components have been mounted.** If your component has child components, their `mounted` hooks will have already been executed.
- **Perfect for DOM-related operations.** This hook is the ideal place to perform DOM-related operations such as:
  - Directly manipulating elements
  - Integrating with third-party libraries that require DOM access (e.g., initializing a jQuery plugin)
  - Focusing an input field
  - Measuring element dimensions

Here's an example of using the `mounted` hook:

```plaintext
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello, Vue!',
    };
  },
  mounted() {
    console.log('Component mounted!');
    this.highlightText();
  },
  methods: {
    highlightText() {
      const element = document.getElementById('my-text');
      if (element) {
        element.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
      }
    }
  },
  template: `
    <div id="my-text">
      {{ message }}
    </div>
  `
};
```

In this example, the `mounted` hook is used to:

1.  Log a message to the console.
2.  Call the `highlightText` method. This method uses `document.getElementById` to find the element with the ID "my-text" and then changes its background color to yellow. This type of direct DOM manipulation is only possible within the `mounted` hook (or later), as the element is guaranteed to exist in the DOM at this point.

## Key Differences Summarized: Created vs. Mounted

| Feature          | `created`                                   | `mounted`                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Timing           | Before DOM mounting                         | After DOM mounting                        |
| DOM Access       | **Not available.** `this.$el` is undefined. | **Available.** You can access `this.$el`. |
| Child Components | Not yet mounted                             | All child components are mounted          |
| Use Cases        | Initial data fetching, initial logic        | DOM manipulation, third-party integration |

## When to Use Which Hook: Practical Guidelines

Here's a simple guide to help you choose between `created` and `mounted`:

- **Use `created` for:**

  - Initializing data properties.
  - Fetching data from APIs or other data sources (asynchronously).
  - Setting up event listeners that don't rely on DOM elements.
  - Performing any logic that doesn't require access to the DOM.

- **Use `mounted` for:**
  - Directly manipulating DOM elements (e.g., changing styles, adding classes, setting attributes).
  - Integrating with third-party libraries that require DOM access.
  - Focusing an input field.
  - Measuring the dimensions of an element.
  - Setting up event listeners that depend on DOM elements being present.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Considerations

When building Vue.js applications with server-side rendering (SSR) using frameworks like Nuxt.js or VuePress, it's crucial to be aware of the environment in which these lifecycle hooks are executed. The `mounted` hook is **not** executed on the server. This is because there is no actual DOM on the server. Attempting to access `this.$el` within the `mounted` hook during SSR will result in errors.

Therefore, you should avoid DOM-related operations within the `mounted` hook when building SSR applications. Instead, move such logic to client-side specific hooks or conditional blocks that only execute in the browser environment. You can check if the code is running in a browser environment using `typeof window !== 'undefined'`.

The `created` hook, on the other hand, **is** executed on the server during SSR. This makes it a good place to fetch data that is needed to render the initial HTML on the server.

## Example with SSR Considerations:

```plaintext
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello, Vue!',
      clientOnlyData: 'Loading...'
    };
  },
  created() {
    // Fetch initial data for server-side rendering
    this.fetchServerData();
  },
  mounted() {
    // DOM Manipulation - only execute on the client
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      console.log('Running in the browser!');
      this.getClientOnlyData();
      this.highlightText();
    }
  },
  methods: {
    async fetchServerData() {
      // Simulate fetching data for the server
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
      this.message = 'Data loaded on server!';
    },
    async getClientOnlyData() {
        this.clientOnlyData = "Client only data loaded";
    },
    highlightText() {
      const element = document.getElementById('my-text');
      if (element) {
        element.style.backgroundColor = 'lightblue';
      }
    }
  },
  template: `
    <div id="my-text">
      {{ message }}
      <p v-if="typeof window !== 'undefined'">{{clientOnlyData}}</p>
    </div>
  `
};
```

In this example:

- `fetchServerData` is called in `created` and simulates fetching data for the server. It updates the `message` data property, which will be rendered in the initial HTML generated on the server.
- The `mounted` hook contains a check for `typeof window !== 'undefined'` to ensure that the code only executes in the browser environment.
- `highlightText` and `getClientOnlyData` are only called within the `mounted` hook and are guarded by the `typeof window !== 'undefined'` condition.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between the `created` and `mounted` hooks is essential for building efficient and maintainable Vue.js applications. By knowing when to use each hook, you can ensure that your code is executed at the appropriate time in the component's lifecycle and avoid common pitfalls related to DOM access and server-side rendering. Use `created` for initial setup and data fetching, and `mounted` for DOM-related operations. Happy coding!
