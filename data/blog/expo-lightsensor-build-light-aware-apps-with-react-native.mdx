# Expo LightSensor: Build Light-Aware Apps with React Native

The Expo LightSensor API provides a straightforward way to access the ambient light sensor on iOS and Android devices within your React Native applications. This opens up exciting possibilities for creating light-aware apps that can adapt to environmental lighting conditions, improving user experience and providing unique features.  This guide will walk you through using the `expo-sensors` library to access and utilize light sensor data in your projects.

## Why Use the Light Sensor?

The light sensor measures the intensity of ambient light surrounding the device.  Applications for this data are numerous and varied:

*   **Automatic Theme Switching:**  Dynamically switch between light and dark themes based on ambient light, reducing eye strain in dim environments.
*   **Smart Brightness Control:**  Adjust screen brightness based on the environment, saving battery and improving visibility.
*   **Interactive Art Installations:**  Create reactive art experiences where the light in the environment affects the visual output of the application.
*   **Gaming:**  Incorporate ambient light data into gameplay mechanics for enhanced realism and immersion.
*   **Security:**  Detect changes in light conditions, potentially triggering alerts or actions in security-focused applications.
*   **Adaptive UIs:** Modify the UI to improve readability in varied lighting.

## Getting Started with Expo LightSensor

First, you'll need to have an Expo project set up. If you don't already have one, create a new project using the Expo CLI:

```bash
npx create-expo-app my-light-sensor-app
cd my-light-sensor-app
```

Next, install the `expo-sensors` package:

```bash
npx expo install expo-sensors
```

This package includes the LightSensor API, along with other useful sensors like accelerometer and gyroscope.

## Basic Usage: Reading Light Intensity

The core functionality revolves around the `LightSensor` object from `expo-sensors`.  Let's start with a simple example that displays the current light intensity:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { LightSensor } from 'expo-sensors';

export default function App() {
  const [light, setLight] = useState(null);
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    subscribe();
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  const subscribe = () => {
    setSubscription(
      LightSensor.addListener(lightData => {
        setLight(lightData.illuminance);
      })
    );
  };

  const unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove();
    setSubscription(null);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Light Sensor Example</Text>
      <Text>
        Illuminance: {light}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Necessary Modules:** We import `useState`, `useEffect` from React,  `StyleSheet`, `Text`, `View` from `react-native`, and `LightSensor` from `expo-sensors`.
2.  **State Variables:** We use `useState` to manage the current light intensity (`light`) and the subscription object (`subscription`).
3.  **`useEffect` Hook:** This hook sets up the subscription when the component mounts and unsubscribes when the component unmounts. This ensures that the sensor listener is only active when the component is visible, preventing memory leaks and unnecessary battery drain.
4.  **`subscribe` Function:** This function uses `LightSensor.addListener` to start listening for light sensor updates.  The callback function receives a `lightData` object, which contains the `illuminance` property (representing the light intensity in lux). We update the `light` state with the new illuminance value.
5.  **`unsubscribe` Function:** This function removes the sensor listener using `subscription.remove()`. It's crucial to unsubscribe when the component is no longer needed to avoid performance issues.
6.  **Rendering:**  We display the current `illuminance` value in a `Text` component.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Permissions:** While `expo-sensors` generally handles permissions automatically, certain platforms might require explicit permission requests.  Consider using `expo-permissions` or `expo-application` to check and request necessary permissions if you encounter issues.  For example:

    ```javascript
    import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

    const checkPermissions = async () => {
      const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA); // example only - camera permission is unrelated but shows process
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        console.log('Permission to access camera was denied');
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    };
    ```

*   **Platform Differences:** Sensor behavior can vary slightly across different devices and platforms. Test your application thoroughly on both iOS and Android to ensure consistent functionality.
*   **Performance:** Continuously listening to sensor data can impact battery life.  Use the `setUpdateInterval` method (discussed below) to reduce the frequency of updates if high precision is not required.

## Controlling the Update Interval

By default, the LightSensor reports data at a relatively high frequency. You can adjust the update interval using the `setUpdateInterval` method:

```javascript
LightSensor.setUpdateInterval(500); // Update every 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds)
```

Slower update intervals can significantly improve battery life, especially if your application doesn't require real-time updates. Add this line inside your `subscribe` function, before `LightSensor.addListener`.

## Detecting Device Availability

Before subscribing to sensor data, you might want to check if the LightSensor is actually available on the device. Use `LightSensor.isAvailableAsync()` for this purpose:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { LightSensor } from 'expo-sensors';

export default function App() {
  const [light, setLight] = useState(null);
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null);
  const [isAvailable, setIsAvailable] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    checkAvailability();
  }, []);

  const checkAvailability = async () => {
    const available = await LightSensor.isAvailableAsync();
    setIsAvailable(available);
    if (available) {
      subscribe();
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, []);


  const subscribe = () => {
    setSubscription(
      LightSensor.addListener(lightData => {
        setLight(lightData.illuminance);
      })
    );
  };

  const unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove();
    setSubscription(null);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Light Sensor Example</Text>
      <Text>
        Light Sensor Available: {isAvailable ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
      </Text>
      {isAvailable && (
        <Text>
          Illuminance: {light}
        </Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

This code checks if the sensor is available and only subscribes if it is, displaying a message to the user if not.

## Error Handling

While less common with the LightSensor than with some other sensors, it's good practice to include error handling in your code.  You can wrap the `addListener` call in a `try...catch` block:

```javascript
  const subscribe = () => {
    try {
      setSubscription(
        LightSensor.addListener(lightData => {
          setLight(lightData.illuminance);
        })
      );
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error subscribing to light sensor:", error);
      // Optionally display an error message to the user.
    }
  };
```

This will catch any exceptions thrown by the `addListener` method and allow you to handle them gracefully.

## Putting It All Together: Automatic Theme Switching Example

Let's create a more practical example: an application that automatically switches between light and dark themes based on the ambient light level.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Appearance } from 'react-native';
import { LightSensor } from 'expo-sensors';

export default function App() {
  const [light, setLight] = useState(null);
  const [subscription, setSubscription] = useState(null);
  const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(Appearance.getColorScheme() === 'dark');


  const DARK_THRESHOLD = 50; // Adjust this value based on your preference

  useEffect(() => {
    const appearanceListener = Appearance.addChangeListener((scheme) => {
      setIsDarkMode(scheme.colorScheme === 'dark');
    });
    subscribe();
    return () => {
      unsubscribe();
      appearanceListener.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  const subscribe = () => {
    LightSensor.setUpdateInterval(500); //Update less often
    setSubscription(
      LightSensor.addListener(lightData => {
        setLight(lightData.illuminance);
        if (lightData.illuminance < DARK_THRESHOLD) {
          setIsDarkMode(true);
        } else {
          setIsDarkMode(false);
        }
      })
    );
  };

  const unsubscribe = () => {
    subscription && subscription.remove();
    setSubscription(null);
  };

  const backgroundColor = isDarkMode ? '#000' : '#fff';
  const textColor = isDarkMode ? '#fff' : '#000';

  return (
    <View style={[styles.container, { backgroundColor }]}>
      <Text style={{ color: textColor }}>Light Sensor Example</Text>
      <Text style={{ color: textColor }}>
        Illuminance: {light}
      </Text>
      <Text style={{ color: textColor }}>
        Theme: {isDarkMode ? 'Dark' : 'Light'}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

**Key improvements and explanations:**

*   **`Appearance` API:** Uses `Appearance.getColorScheme()` and `Appearance.addChangeListener` to listen for system-level theme changes (dark mode being enabled/disabled in the device settings).  This ensures the app respects the user's preference even if the light sensor isn't triggering a change. Critically, the Appearance subscription is removed on unmount.
*   **`DARK_THRESHOLD`:** A constant that defines the light level (in lux) at which the app switches to dark mode.  Adjust this value based on your preference and testing.
*   **Theme State:** `isDarkMode` stores the current theme state (true for dark mode, false for light mode).
*   **Dynamic Styling:**  The `backgroundColor` and `textColor` are dynamically set based on the `isDarkMode` state.
* **Using AppearanceChangeListener to trigger update on System theme change** Without the Appearance API change listener, you will need to cover your light sensor on every app start if your System theme is already in dark mode.
* **Reduced Update Rate**: `LightSensor.setUpdateInterval(500);` lowers the light sensor read rate.
* **Comprehensive unmount handling** appearanceListener and LightSensor subscription are unsubscribed during unmount to avoid memory leak and potential errors.

This example provides a more complete and robust implementation of automatic theme switching, considering both ambient light levels and user preferences.
