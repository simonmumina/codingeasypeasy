# Ionic Network Connectivity: Check and Monitor Internet Access in Your Apps

In today's connected world, ensuring reliable network connectivity is crucial for any mobile application. For Ionic developers building cross-platform apps, understanding how to check and monitor internet access is paramount. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to effectively manage network connectivity in your Ionic applications using the Cordova network plugin.

## Why Network Connectivity Matters in Ionic Apps

A mobile app's user experience heavily relies on a stable and reliable network connection. Poor network connectivity can lead to:

- **Broken Functionality:** Features that require internet access (e.g., fetching data, submitting forms) will fail.
- **Frustrated Users:** A slow or unreliable app can lead to negative reviews and user attrition.
- **Data Loss:** Inconsistent network connections can result in data not being saved or synchronized correctly.

By properly checking and monitoring network connectivity, you can:

- **Gracefully Handle Offline Scenarios:** Inform users when they're offline and provide alternative functionality.
- **Optimize Data Usage:** Defer large data transfers until a stable Wi-Fi connection is available.
- **Improve User Experience:** By providing clear feedback about the network status, you can manage user expectations.

## Using the Cordova Network Information Plugin

The Cordova Network Information plugin is the standard way to check and monitor network connectivity in Ionic applications. It provides access to information about the device's network connection type and whether the device has internet access.

### Installation

First, install the Cordova plugin:

```plaintext
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-network-information
npm install @ionic-native/network
```

This command installs both the Cordova plugin and the Ionic Native wrapper, which makes it easier to use the plugin within your Angular/TypeScript code.

### Import and Inject the Network Service

Import the `Network` service from `@ionic-native/network` in your desired component or service:

```plaintext
import { Network } from '@ionic-native/network/ngx'
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular'
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class NetworkService {
  constructor(
    private network: Network,
    private platform: Platform
  ) {}

  public initializeNetworkEvents(): void {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      this.network.onDisconnect().subscribe(() => {
        console.log('network was disconnected :-(')
        // Handle disconnection logic here, e.g., display a notification
        // Example using Ionic's AlertController (you'll need to import it)
        // const alert = this.alertController.create({
        //   header: 'Connection Lost',
        //   message: 'It seems you are not connected to the internet.',
        //   buttons: ['OK']
        // });
        // alert.then(a => a.present());
      })

      this.network.onConnect().subscribe(() => {
        console.log('network connected!')
        // We just got a connection but we need to wait briefly
        // before we determine the connection type.  Might need to wait...
        // before the connection is ready (that's why we use setTimeout here).
        setTimeout(() => {
          if (this.network.type === 'wifi') {
            console.log('we got a wifi connection, woohoo!')
          }
        }, 3000)
      })
    })
  }

  public getNetworkType(): string {
    return this.network.type
  }

  public isOnline(): boolean {
    return this.network.type !== 'none' // 'none' indicates no network connection
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import { Network } from '@ionic-native/network/ngx';`**: Imports the necessary `Network` service. The `/ngx` is crucial for using Ionic Native v5+ with Angular's dependency injection.
- **`import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular';`**: The `Platform` service is needed to ensure the code runs only after the platform (e.g., Android, iOS, browser) is ready. This is essential because the Cordova plugin APIs are not available immediately.
- **`@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`**: Makes the `NetworkService` available throughout your application using Angular's dependency injection.
- **`constructor(private network: Network, private platform: Platform) { }`**: Injects the `Network` and `Platform` services into the constructor.
- **`public initializeNetworkEvents(): void`**: This method sets up listeners for the `disconnect` and `connect` events. It's important to call this method somewhere in your app's initialization (e.g., in `app.component.ts` or a similar global component).
- **`this.platform.ready().then(() => { ... });`**: This ensures the Cordova plugins are initialized before you attempt to use them. It's crucial for preventing errors on device.
- **`this.network.onDisconnect().subscribe(() => { ... });`**: Subscribes to the `disconnect` event, which is triggered when the device loses its network connection. The code inside the `subscribe` block will be executed when the event occurs. The example demonstrates how to use Ionic's `AlertController` (which you'd need to import) to display a notification to the user.
- **`this.network.onConnect().subscribe(() => { ... });`**: Subscribes to the `connect` event, which is triggered when the device gains a network connection. The example includes a `setTimeout` to allow the connection to fully establish before determining the connection type.
- **`this.network.type`**: This property returns the type of network connection (e.g., `wifi`, `cellular`, `ethernet`, `none`, `unknown`). The example shows how to check if the connection is `wifi`.
- **`public getNetworkType(): string`**: A simple getter method to return the current network type.
- **`public isOnline(): boolean`**: A helper method to check if the device is currently online.

### Usage Example in `app.component.ts`

```plaintext
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular'
import { StatusBar } from '@ionic-native/status-bar/ngx'
import { SplashScreen } from '@ionic-native/splash-screen/ngx'
import { NetworkService } from './network.service'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['app.component.scss'],
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(
    private platform: Platform,
    private statusBar: StatusBar,
    private splashScreen: SplashScreen,
    private networkService: NetworkService // Inject NetworkService
  ) {
    this.initializeApp()
  }

  initializeApp() {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      this.statusBar.styleDefault()
      this.splashScreen.hide()

      // Initialize network events
      this.networkService.initializeNetworkEvents()
    })
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Import the `NetworkService` you created earlier.
- Inject the `NetworkService` into the `AppComponent`'s constructor.
- Call `this.networkService.initializeNetworkEvents()` inside the `initializeApp` method, after the platform is ready. This ensures the network event listeners are set up as soon as the app starts.

### Checking Network Status on Demand

You can also check the network status on demand, for example, when a user tries to perform an action that requires internet access:

```plaintext
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { NetworkService } from './network.service' // Import the service

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.scss'],
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private networkService: NetworkService) {}

  performAction() {
    if (this.networkService.isOnline()) {
      // Perform the action that requires internet access
      console.log('Performing action with internet access...')
      // ... your code here ...
    } else {
      // Display a message to the user that they are offline
      console.log('No internet connection.  Cannot perform action.')
      // You might use an AlertController here to show a user-friendly message.
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Import the `NetworkService` in your component.
- Inject the `NetworkService` into the constructor.
- Call `this.networkService.isOnline()` to check the network status.
- Based on the network status, perform the appropriate action.

### Using Ionic's AlertController to Inform the User

A common practice is to use Ionic's `AlertController` to inform the user about the network status:

```plaintext
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { NetworkService } from './network.service'
import { AlertController } from '@ionic/angular'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.scss'],
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(
    private networkService: NetworkService,
    private alertController: AlertController
  ) {}

  async presentAlert(message: string) {
    const alert = await this.alertController.create({
      header: 'Alert',
      message: message,
      buttons: ['OK'],
    })

    await alert.present()
  }

  performAction() {
    if (this.networkService.isOnline()) {
      // Perform the action that requires internet access
      console.log('Performing action with internet access...')
      // ... your code here ...
    } else {
      // Display a message to the user that they are offline
      console.log('No internet connection.  Cannot perform action.')
      this.presentAlert('No internet connection. Please check your connection and try again.')
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Import `AlertController` from `@ionic/angular`.
- Inject `AlertController` into your component's constructor.
- Create an asynchronous `presentAlert` method that takes a message as input and displays an alert using the `AlertController`.
- Call `this.presentAlert()` inside the `else` block of your `performAction` method to display an alert to the user when they are offline.

## Handling Different Network Types

The `network.type` property can return different values depending on the network connection:

- `wifi`: The device is connected to a Wi-Fi network.
- `cellular`: The device is connected to a cellular network (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G).
- `ethernet`: The device is connected to an Ethernet network.
- `none`: The device is not connected to any network.
- `unknown`: The network connection type is unknown.

You can use this information to tailor your app's behavior based on the network type. For example, you might defer large data transfers until a Wi-Fi connection is available.

```plaintext
if (this.networkService.getNetworkType() === 'wifi') {
  // Perform large data transfer
  console.log('Performing large data transfer over Wi-Fi...')
} else {
  // Defer data transfer until Wi-Fi is available
  console.log('Deferring data transfer until Wi-Fi is available...')
}
```

## Important Considerations

- **Platform Specific Behavior:** Network connectivity behavior can vary across different platforms (iOS, Android, web). Thoroughly test your app on different devices and platforms.
- **Background Restrictions:** Some operating systems (e.g., iOS) have restrictions on background network usage. Be mindful of these restrictions when designing your app's behavior.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected network errors.
- **Permissions:** Ensure your app has the necessary permissions to access network information. The Cordova plugin will generally handle this automatically, but it's good to be aware of.
- **Simulator/Emulator Limitations:** Testing network connectivity in simulators or emulators can sometimes be unreliable. It's recommended to test on physical devices whenever possible.

## Conclusion

Checking and monitoring network connectivity is a crucial aspect of building robust and user-friendly Ionic applications. By using the Cordova Network Information plugin and following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively manage network connectivity in your apps and provide a seamless experience for your users, even in offline or unreliable network conditions. Remember to prioritize user experience by providing clear and informative messages about the network status. By anticipating and handling different network scenarios, you can significantly improve the quality and reliability of your Ionic applications.
