# Feature Flagging Flask Applications with Statsig and Python SDK: A Comprehensive Guide

Feature flagging, also known as feature toggles, is a powerful technique that enables you to control the release of new features in your software without deploying new code. This allows for continuous delivery, A/B testing, and a more controlled release process. This blog post will guide you through implementing feature flagging in your Flask applications using the Statsig Python SDK. We'll cover everything from setting up your Statsig account and SDK to implementing feature flags in your application code.

## Why Feature Flagging?

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly discuss the benefits of feature flagging:

- **Reduced Risk:** Roll out new features to a small percentage of users before releasing them to everyone. This allows you to identify and address issues early on, minimizing the impact of bugs or unexpected behavior.
- **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different versions of a feature to see which performs best. Feature flags allow you to easily segment users and track their engagement with different variations.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Merge code frequently and deploy it without necessarily making all features available to users. Feature flags give you the flexibility to control when features are enabled.
- **Targeted Releases:** Release features to specific user segments based on criteria like location, device, or subscription level.
- **Emergency Shut-Off:** Instantly disable a problematic feature without needing to deploy new code.

## Introduction to Statsig

Statsig is a feature flagging and experimentation platform that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing and analyzing feature flags. It offers a user-friendly interface, robust SDKs for various languages (including Python), and powerful analytics capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.6+:** Make sure you have a Python environment set up.
- **Flask:** Install Flask using `pip install flask`.
- **Statsig Account:** Create a free account at [Statsig.com](https://statsig.com/).
- **Statsig SDK Key:** Obtain your Client SDK Key from your Statsig project's settings. This key is crucial for initializing the SDK in your application. **Remember to use the client-side key, not the server-side secret key in your frontend applications!**

## Step 1: Installing the Statsig Python SDK

Install the Statsig Python SDK using pip:

```plaintext
pip install statsig
```

## Step 2: Initializing the Statsig SDK in your Flask Application

In your Flask application, initialize the Statsig SDK when the application starts. It's best to do this outside of your request handlers to avoid re-initializing on every request.

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import statsig

app = Flask(__name__)

# Replace with your actual Client SDK Key
STATSIG_CLIENT_KEY = "YOUR_CLIENT_SDK_KEY"

def initialize_statsig():
    try:
        statsig.initialize(STATSIG_CLIENT_KEY)  # Initialize statsig here.
        print("Statsig initialized successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error initializing Statsig: {e}")


# Initialize Statsig only once when the app starts
with app.app_context():
    initialize_statsig()


@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Example user object
    user = {"userID": "user123", "email": "user123@example.com"}

    # Check if a feature flag is enabled for the user
    is_new_homepage_enabled = statsig.check_gate(user, "new_homepage_enabled")

    # Get the value of a dynamic config
    config_value = statsig.get_config(user, "homepage_config").value

    if is_new_homepage_enabled:
        homepage_content = "Welcome to the new homepage!"
    else:
        homepage_content = "Welcome to the default homepage!"


    return render_template('index.html', homepage_content=homepage_content, config_value=config_value)



@app.route('/experiment')
def experiment():
    user = {"userID": "user456", "email": "user456@example.com"}
    experiment_result = statsig.get_experiment(user, "pricing_experiment")

    if experiment_result.group == "control":
        price = 9.99
        message = "Control group: Standard pricing"
    elif experiment_result.group == "treatment":
        price = 7.99
        message = "Treatment group: Discounted pricing"
    else:
        price = 12.99
        message = "Fallback pricing (unexpected group)"

    return render_template('experiment.html', price=price, message=message)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`STATSIG_CLIENT_KEY`:** Replace `"YOUR_CLIENT_SDK_KEY"` with your actual Client SDK Key from Statsig. **Important:** Use the _client-side_ key for client-side applications (web browsers, mobile apps). Use the server-side key for backend services. For this example, assume we're running Flask primarily for backend tasks, but showing a frontend rendered template as well, thus using the client SDK key for feature flags evaluated on client-side.
- **`statsig.initialize(STATSIG_CLIENT_KEY)`:** This line initializes the Statsig SDK with your Client SDK Key. This _must_ be done before you use any other Statsig functions. We are running it in the application context of Flask to make it accessible throughout.
- **`statsig.check_gate(user, "new_homepage_enabled")`:** This checks if the feature gate named `"new_homepage_enabled"` is enabled for the specified user. The `user` object is a dictionary containing user attributes (see below). It returns `True` if the gate is enabled, and `False` otherwise.
- **`statsig.get_config(user, "homepage_config")`:** This retrieves a dynamic config named `"homepage_config"` for the specified user. Dynamic configs allow you to customize application behavior and appearance based on user attributes. The `value` attribute of the returned config object contains the actual configuration data (e.g., a dictionary of settings).
- **`statsig.get_experiment(user, "pricing_experiment")`:** This retrieves the experiment named `"pricing_experiment"` for the specified user. It returns an object whose `group` attribute tells us which group the user belongs to. This is central for A/B testing.

## Step 3: Defining Users

The `user` object is crucial for targeting feature flags and experiments to specific users. It should be a dictionary containing relevant user attributes. Statsig supports various user attributes, including:

- **`userID` (Required):** A unique identifier for the user.
- **`email`:** The user's email address.
- **`country`:** The user's country.
- **`custom`:** A dictionary of custom attributes that you define.

Example User Object:

```plaintext
user = {
    "userID": "user123",
    "email": "user123@example.com",
    "country": "US",
    "custom": {
        "subscription_level": "premium",
        "device_type": "mobile"
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Creating Feature Gates and Dynamic Configs in Statsig

1.  **Log in to your Statsig account.**
2.  **Navigate to your project.**
3.  **Create Feature Gates:**
    - Go to the "Feature Gates" section.
    - Click "Create".
    - Enter a name for your feature gate (e.g., `"new_homepage_enabled"`).
    - Define the rules for enabling the gate. You can use various conditions based on user attributes, time of day, or other factors. For example, you can enable the gate for all users or only for users in a specific country.
4.  **Create Dynamic Configs:**

    - Go to the "Dynamic Configs" section.
    - Click "Create".
    - Enter a name for your dynamic config (e.g., `"homepage_config"`).
    - Define the default value for the config (e.g., a JSON object with settings for the homepage).
    - Create rules to customize the config value based on user attributes.

5.  **Create Experiments:**
    - Go to "Experiments" section.
    - Create an Experiment with the name you specified in the Python code (e.g. `pricing_experiment`).
    - Define the different groups of the experiment (e.g. `control` and `treatment`).
    - Define the allocation of users to each group.

## Step 5: Implementing Feature Flags in your Flask Views

Now, you can use the `statsig.check_gate()` and `statsig.get_config()` functions in your Flask views to control the behavior of your application.

Refer to the example code at the start. We created a sample route `/` that uses a feature flag to decide which homepage to display.

## Step 6: Creating the HTML templates

Create two simple HTML templates to display results from the Flask route

**templates/index.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Statsig Feature Flag Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ homepage_content }}</h1>
    <p>Config value: {{ config_value }}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**templates/experiment.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Statsig A/B Testing Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    <p>Price: ${{ price }}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Step 7: Cleaning up and closing the Statsig SDK

It's important to close the Statsig SDK when your application shuts down to ensure that all events are flushed and no data is lost. Add the following code to your application:

```plaintext
import atexit

@atexit.register
def shutdown():
    try:
        statsig.shutdown()
        print("Statsig shutdown successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error shutting down Statsig: {e}")
```

This code registers a function `shutdown()` to be called when the application exits. The `statsig.shutdown()` function ensures that all events are flushed to the Statsig server.

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive names for your feature flags and dynamic configs.** This will make it easier to understand their purpose and manage them over time.
- **Keep your feature flags and dynamic configs organized.** Consider using a naming convention or a tagging system to group related flags and configs.
- **Remove obsolete feature flags and dynamic configs.** Once a feature is fully released or an experiment is complete, remove the corresponding flags and configs to avoid clutter and confusion.
- **Test your feature flag implementation thoroughly.** Ensure that your application behaves as expected when feature flags are enabled or disabled.
- **Use Statsig's analytics capabilities to track the performance of your feature flags and experiments.** This will help you make data-driven decisions about feature releases and optimizations.
- **Separate Client-Side and Server-Side Feature Flags:** Understand when to use the client-side SDK vs the server-side SDK. Avoid using the server-side key in your frontend javascript application as this could lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **Start Small:** Don't try to feature flag everything at once. Begin with a single feature or experiment and gradually expand your usage of feature flags as you become more comfortable with the process.

## Conclusion

Feature flagging with Statsig and the Python SDK is a powerful way to manage feature releases, conduct experiments, and improve your development workflow. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily integrate feature flags into your Flask applications and leverage the benefits of continuous delivery, A/B testing, and targeted releases. Remember to follow the best practices to ensure that your feature flag implementation is well-organized, tested, and optimized for performance. Happy feature flagging!
