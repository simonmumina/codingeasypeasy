# How to Install Apache Cassandra on Ubuntu: A Comprehensive Guide

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step process on how to install and configure Apache Cassandra on Ubuntu. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will guide you through the entire installation, configuration and verification process, ensuring a smooth setup.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **An Ubuntu Server:** You need a running Ubuntu server. A fresh installation is highly recommended. This guide focuses on Ubuntu 20.04 or later, but generally applies to any relatively recent Ubuntu version.
- **Sudo Privileges:** You need a user account with `sudo` privileges to perform administrative tasks.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Cassandra requires a JDK to run. We'll be installing OpenJDK, which is the recommended and often preferred choice for open-source projects.
- **Basic Terminal Knowledge:** Familiarity with basic Linux commands is essential.

## Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

Cassandra is a Java-based application, so we need to install a suitable JDK. We will be using OpenJDK.

1.  **Update the package index:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    ```

2.  **Install OpenJDK:** Cassandra 3.x and later require Java 8 or higher. Cassandra 4.x officially supports Java 11 and is recommended. Let's install Java 11.

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    ```

3.  **Verify the Java installation:**

    ```plaintext
    java -version
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```
    openjdk version "11.0.20" 2023-07-18
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.20+8-Ubuntu-120.04.1)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.20+8-Ubuntu-120.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
    ```

## Step 2: Add the Cassandra Repository

To install Cassandra, we need to add its official repository to our Ubuntu system.

1.  **Add the Cassandra repository key:**

    First, download the Cassandra signing key:

    ```plaintext
    wget -q -O - https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

    If you encounter issues with `apt-key add`, you might need to use a different approach:

    ```plaintext
    wget -q -O - https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cassandra.asc
    ```

2.  **Add the Cassandra source list:**

    Create a new file named `cassandra.sources` in the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` directory. The content of this file depends on the version of Cassandra you want to install. We'll install Cassandra 4.x.

    ```plaintext
    echo "deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 41x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources
    ```

    **Important Note:** Replace `41x` with `40x` if you want to install Cassandra 4.0. Consult the Apache Cassandra website for the most current repository information.

3.  **Update the package index again:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    ```

    You may see warnings related to the repository not having a Release file. This is common and usually not a problem.

## Step 3: Install Cassandra

Now that we have the repository configured, we can proceed with the installation.

1.  **Install Cassandra:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install cassandra
    ```

    This command will download and install Cassandra and its dependencies.

## Step 4: Configure Cassandra

After installation, some basic configuration is often necessary. While the default configuration works, adjusting some parameters is highly recommended for production environments.

1.  **Edit the `cassandra.yaml` file:**

    The main configuration file is located at `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml`. Open it with your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`).

    ```plaintext
    sudo nano /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
    ```

    Here are some common configuration options to consider:

    - **`cluster_name`:** Change this to a meaningful name for your Cassandra cluster. For example:

      ```plaintext
      cluster_name: 'MyProductionCluster'
      ```

    - **`listen_address`:** This should be the IP address that Cassandra listens on. If you want Cassandra to be accessible from other machines, set it to the server's public or private IP address. For a single-node setup on the same machine, you can leave it as the default. For production, specify the IP. **Example:**

      ```plaintext
      listen_address: 192.168.1.10
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `192.168.1.10` with your server's actual IP address.

    - **`rpc_address`:** This is the address that Cassandra uses for client connections. Similar to `listen_address`, it should be set to the server's IP address for remote access. **Example:**

      ```plaintext
      rpc_address: 192.168.1.10
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `192.168.1.10` with your server's actual IP address.

    - **`seeds`:** This is a list of Cassandra nodes that new nodes use to discover the cluster. In a single-node setup, it should be set to the same IP address as `listen_address`. In multi-node clusters, this list should contain the IP addresses of a few seed nodes. **Example:**

      ```plaintext
      seeds: '192.168.1.10'
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `192.168.1.10` with your server's actual IP address (or a comma-separated list of seed node IPs in a multi-node setup).

    - **`data_file_directories`:** Specifies the directories where Cassandra stores its data. Consider using separate disks for data for better performance.

      ```plaintext
      data_file_directories:
        - /var/lib/cassandra/data
      ```

    - **`commitlog_directory`:** Specifies the directory where Cassandra stores its commit logs. It's often beneficial to place this on a separate, fast disk.

      ```plaintext
      commitlog_directory: /var/lib/cassandra/commitlog
      ```

    - **`saved_caches_directory`:** Directory for saved caches.

      ```plaintext
      saved_caches_directory: /var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches
      ```

    **Important Notes on Configuration:**

    - These are just a few of the many configuration options available in `cassandra.yaml`.
    - Consult the official Apache Cassandra documentation for a complete list and detailed explanations of all configuration options: [https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/)
    - Always back up the `cassandra.yaml` file before making any changes.
    - Carefully consider your hardware and workload when choosing values for these settings. Incorrect configuration can significantly impact performance.

2.  **Edit the `cassandra-env.sh` file (Optional but Recommended):**

    This file (`/etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh`) contains environment variables that affect Cassandra's behavior. You might want to adjust the JVM options.

    ```plaintext
    sudo nano /etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh
    ```

    Consider these settings:

    - **`MAX_HEAP_SIZE` and `HEAP_NEWSIZE`:** These control the maximum heap size for the Java Virtual Machine. Allocate these based on your system's available memory and expected workload. A good starting point is often half of your total RAM, but never more than 32GB.

      ```plaintext
      MAX_HEAP_SIZE="4G"  # Example: 4GB of RAM
      HEAP_NEWSIZE="800M" # Example: 800MB for the young generation
      ```

3.  **Adjust `systemd` configuration if needed:**

For very large workloads you may need to change the `TimeoutStartSec` in `/lib/systemd/system/cassandra.service`. Cassandra can take longer than the default to start, especially the first time after installation.

```plaintext
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/cassandra.service
```

Look for the `TimeoutStartSec` line and increase the value. For example, change it to `TimeoutStartSec=600` (10 minutes). Save the file and reload the `systemd` daemon:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Step 5: Start and Verify Cassandra

After configuring Cassandra, start the service and verify that it's running correctly.

1.  **Start the Cassandra service:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl start cassandra
    ```

2.  **Check the status of the Cassandra service:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl status cassandra
    ```

    If Cassandra is running successfully, you should see output similar to:

    ```
    ● cassandra.service - Apache Cassandra
         Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cassandra.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
         Active: active (running) since Tue 2024-10-27 14:30:00 UTC; 10s ago
           Docs: http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/trunk/
       Main PID: 1234 (java)
          Tasks: 100 (limit: 4667)
         Memory: 1.5G
         CGroup: /system.slice/cassandra.service
                 └─1234 /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java -Xms2048m -Xmx2048m ...
    ```

    If the service is not running, check the Cassandra logs for errors. The logs are located at `/var/log/cassandra/system.log`.

3.  **Connect to Cassandra using `cqlsh` (Cassandra Query Language Shell):**

    `cqlsh` is the command-line interface for interacting with Cassandra.

    ```plaintext
    cqlsh
    ```

    If you configured `listen_address` and `rpc_address` to a specific IP, you may need to specify the host:

    ```plaintext
    cqlsh <your_cassandra_ip>
    ```

    Replace `<your_cassandra_ip>` with the IP address you configured.

    You should see a prompt similar to:

    ```
    Connected to MyProductionCluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
    [cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 4.0.x | CQL spec 3.4.5 | Native protocol v5]
    Use HELP for help.
    cqlsh>
    ```

4.  **Verify the Cassandra Cluster:**

    In the `cqlsh` shell, run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    describe cluster;
    ```

    This will display information about the Cassandra cluster, including the cluster name and partitioner.

5.  **Check the Node Status:**

    Run the following command in `cqlsh`:

    ```plaintext
    select * from system.local;
    ```

    This will display information about the local Cassandra node.

6.  **Exit `cqlsh`:**

    ```plaintext
    exit
    ```

## Step 6: Enable Cassandra on Boot

To ensure that Cassandra starts automatically when the server boots, enable the service:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl enable cassandra
```

## Security Considerations

After installing Cassandra, it's crucial to secure your installation. Here are some key security considerations:

- **Authentication:** Cassandra defaults to no authentication. Enable authentication to protect your data.

  - Edit `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` and set `authenticator: PasswordAuthenticator`.
  - Restart Cassandra.
  - Use `cqlsh` to create users and grant permissions.

- **Authorization:** Enable authorization to control access to resources.

  - Edit `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` and set `authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer`.
  - Restart Cassandra.
  - Use `cqlsh` to grant permissions to users.

- **Encryption:** Consider enabling encryption for both inter-node communication and client connections to protect data in transit.

- **Firewall:** Configure your firewall to allow only necessary traffic to Cassandra ports (9042 for client connections, 7000 and 7001 for inter-node communication, etc.). Use `ufw` or `iptables` to accomplish this.

- **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review your Cassandra configuration and access logs to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cassandra fails to start:** Check the Cassandra logs (`/var/log/cassandra/system.log`) for error messages. Common issues include:
  - Incorrect Java version.
  - Configuration errors in `cassandra.yaml`.
  - Port conflicts.
  - Insufficient memory.
- **`cqlsh` cannot connect:** Verify that Cassandra is running and that the `listen_address` and `rpc_address` are correctly configured. Check your firewall settings.
- **Performance issues:** Monitor Cassandra's performance using tools like `nodetool` and the DataStax OpsCenter. Tune the JVM settings and data model as needed.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully installed and configured Apache Cassandra on Ubuntu! Remember to review the official Cassandra documentation and explore the wide range of features and configuration options available to optimize your Cassandra deployment for your specific needs. Good luck!
