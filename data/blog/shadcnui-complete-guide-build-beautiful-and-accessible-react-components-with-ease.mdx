# Shadcn/ui Complete Guide: Build Beautiful & Accessible React Components with Ease

Shadcn/ui has taken the React world by storm, and for good reason. It's not a traditional component library; it's a collection of accessible and reusable components that you copy and paste into your project.  This approach offers unparalleled customization and control while leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS.  This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively use shadcn/ui and build stunning user interfaces.

## What is Shadcn/ui?

Shadcn/ui is a collection of reusable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.  Unlike traditional component libraries that provide pre-built, often inflexible components, shadcn/ui focuses on providing the *source code* for each component. This means you copy the code directly into your project and customize it to fit your specific needs.

**Key Benefits of Shadcn/ui:**

*   **Unparalleled Customization:**  Since you own the code, you have complete control over every aspect of the component's appearance and behavior.  No more fighting against a library's default styling or behavior.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Shadcn/ui is built with Tailwind CSS, allowing you to easily style and customize components using Tailwind's utility classes. This results in a consistent and maintainable codebase.
*   **Accessibility Focused:**  Shadcn/ui components are built with accessibility in mind, following best practices for ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
*   **Headless UI Foundation:** Many shadcn/ui components leverage Radix UI primitives, a set of unstyled, accessible UI components.  This provides a solid foundation for building complex and robust interfaces.
*   **Performance:**  Since you only include the components you need, you avoid the bloat of traditional component libraries.  This contributes to a faster and more efficient application.
*   **Learn by Doing:** By copying and modifying the source code, you gain a deeper understanding of how UI components are built and how to best utilize React, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI.

## Getting Started with Shadcn/ui

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js and npm or yarn:**  Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.  npm (Node Package Manager) usually comes bundled with Node.js.  Alternatively, you can use yarn.
*   **A React Project:**  You'll need an existing React project.  If you don't have one, you can create a new project using Create React App or Next.js.  This guide will assume you are using Next.js.

    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest my-shadcn-app
    cd my-shadcn-app
    ```

*   **Tailwind CSS:**  Your project needs to be configured with Tailwind CSS.  If you're using Next.js, this is often configured by default. If not, follow the official Tailwind CSS documentation for your specific framework.  You'll also need `tailwindcss` and `postcss` as devDependencies in your `package.json`.

### Installation

Shadcn/ui provides a CLI tool to simplify the installation process.  The CLI will automatically install the necessary dependencies and configure your project.

1.  **Initialize Shadcn/ui:**

    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest init
    ```

    The CLI will guide you through a series of prompts:

    *   **Would you like to use TypeScript?** (Choose Yes or No based on your project)
    *   **Which style would you like to use?** (Default: `default`) You can choose from a variety of pre-defined themes.
    *   **Which color palette would you like to use?** (Default: `slate`) Choose a color palette that matches your brand.
    *   **Where is your global CSS file?** (Usually `app/globals.css` or `styles/globals.css` in Next.js)
    *   **Would you like to use CSS variables for your colors?** (Recommended: Yes)
    *   **Are you using a src directory?** (Choose Yes or No based on your project structure)
    *   **Where is your component directory?** (Default: `components`) This is where the shadcn/ui components will be placed.
    *   **What is the default alias for your components?** (Default: `@/components`) This is the import path for your components.
    *   **Would you like to use a utils file?** (Recommended: Yes)
    *   **What is the alias for your utils file?** (Default: `@/lib/utils`)
    *   **Are you using React Server Components?** (Choose Yes or No based on your project)
    *   **Write configuration to `components.json`. Proceed?** (Confirm with Yes)

2.  **Install a Component:**

    Now that shadcn/ui is initialized, you can install individual components using the CLI.  For example, to install the `Button` component:

    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
    ```

    This will:

    *   Install any necessary dependencies (like `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` if needed).
    *   Create a `Button.tsx` (or `Button.jsx` depending on your TypeScript configuration) file in your `components` directory with the source code for the button.
    *   Add any required CSS classes to your `globals.css` file.

### Using Components

Once a component is installed, you can import it into your React components and use it like any other React component.

```jsx
// components/MyComponent.jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button" // Replace with your component alias

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
      <Button>Click me!</Button>
      <Button variant="secondary">Secondary Button</Button>
      <Button disabled>Disabled Button</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   We import the `Button` component from its location in the `components` directory.
*   We render the `Button` component in our JSX.
*   Shadcn/ui components often have `variant` props to allow for different styling options. The `Button` component includes `default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `outline`, `ghost` and `link` variants.
*   The `disabled` prop allows you to disable the button.

## Customizing Components

The real power of shadcn/ui lies in its customizability.  Since you own the source code, you can modify any aspect of the component.

1.  **Edit the Component File:**

    Open the component file in your `components` directory (e.g., `components/ui/Button.tsx`).

2.  **Modify Tailwind Classes:**

    You can change the Tailwind CSS classes used in the component to adjust its appearance.  For example, to change the primary button's background color to blue, you could modify the `cn` function (explained below) in `Button.tsx` (or `Button.jsx`):

    ```typescript
    import * as React from "react"
    import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

    import { ButtonHTMLAttributes, forwardRef } from "react"

    export interface ButtonProps
      extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {}

    const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
      ({ className, children, variant = "default", ...props }, ref) => {
        return (
          <button
            className={cn(
              "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none ring-offset-background hover:bg-primary/90 h-10 px-4 py-2", // Original classnames
              variant === "default" &&
                "bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600", // Modified primary color
              variant === "secondary" &&
                "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
              variant === "destructive" &&
                "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",
              variant === "outline" &&
                "bg-transparent border border-input hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
              variant === "ghost" && "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
              variant === "link" && "underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
              className
            )}
            ref={ref}
            {...props}
          >
            {children}
          </button>
        )
      }
    )
    Button.displayName = "Button"

    export { Button }
    ```

3.  **Modify Component Logic:**

    You can also modify the component's logic and behavior.  For example, you could add a custom click handler to the `Button` component.

## Understanding the `cn` Utility

The `cn` utility function (typically found in `lib/utils.ts` or `lib/utils.js`) is a crucial part of shadcn/ui. It's a simple function that uses the `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` libraries to conditionally apply Tailwind CSS classes.

```typescript
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

**How it Works:**

*   `clsx` is a library that allows you to conditionally apply CSS classes based on boolean values or object properties.
*   `tailwind-merge` is a library that intelligently merges Tailwind CSS classes, resolving conflicts and ensuring that the correct styles are applied.

**Why Use `cn`?**

*   **Conditional Styling:**  The `cn` function makes it easy to conditionally apply CSS classes based on props or state.
*   **Tailwind Class Conflict Resolution:**  `tailwind-merge` ensures that Tailwind CSS classes are merged correctly, preventing unexpected styling issues.
*   **Readability:**  The `cn` function improves the readability of your code by making it clear which classes are being applied and why.

## Advanced Components and Patterns

### Using `use client`

Many shadcn/ui components require client-side interactivity (e.g., handling button clicks, managing state).  When using these components in a Next.js application, you'll need to use the `"use client"` directive at the top of your component file. This tells Next.js to render the component on the client-side.

```tsx
"use client"

import { useState } from "react"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function MyInteractiveComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <Button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Working with Forms

Shadcn/ui provides a variety of components that are useful for building forms, such as `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, and `Checkbox`.  These components can be easily integrated with form libraries like React Hook Form or Formik.

Here's an example of using `Input` and React Hook Form:

```tsx
"use client"

import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
} from "@/components/ui/form"

export default function MyForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      username: "",
    },
  })

  function onSubmit(values) {
    console.log(values) // Handle form submission here
  }

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="space-y-4">
        <FormField
          control={form.control}
          name="username"
          render={({ field }) => (
            <FormItem>
              <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
              <FormControl>
                <Input placeholder="Username" {...field} />
              </FormControl>
              <FormMessage />
            </FormItem>
          )}
        />
        <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
      </form>
    </Form>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   We're using React Hook Form to manage the form state and validation.
*   The `FormField` component provides a structured way to connect the form state to the UI components.
*   The `Input` component from shadcn/ui is used as the input field.

### Theming and Dark Mode

Shadcn/ui makes it easy to implement theming and dark mode in your application.  The CLI initializes your project with CSS variables that can be used to control the color scheme.

1.  **Modify CSS Variables:**

    Open your `globals.css` file.  You'll find a set of CSS variables under the `:root` selector.  These variables define the colors used throughout your application.

    ```css
    :root {
      --background: 0 0% 100%;
      --foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

      --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;
      --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;

      --popover: 0 0% 100%;
      --popover-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

      --card: 0 0% 100%;
      --card-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

      --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
      --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;

      --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
      --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;
      --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

      --accent: 210 40% 96.1%;
      --accent-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

      --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;
      --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --ring: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

      --radius: 0.5rem;
    }

    .dark {
      --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
      --foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
      --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.9%;

      --popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
      --popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
      --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --border: 216 34% 17%;
      --input: 216 34% 17%;

      --primary: 210 40% 98%;
      --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

      --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
      --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --accent: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
      --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;
      --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

      --ring: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;

      --radius: 0.5rem;
    }
    ```

    Modify these variables to change the colors of your application.  The `.dark` selector contains the variables for dark mode.

2.  **Detect Dark Mode Preference:**

    You'll need to detect the user's preferred color scheme.  You can use the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media query or a JavaScript library like `use-dark-mode`.  The `use-dark-mode` package is easy to use.

    ```bash
    npm install use-dark-mode
    ```

3.  **Toggle Dark Mode:**

    Use a button or switch to toggle between light and dark mode.  You can update the `<html>` element's `data-theme` attribute to reflect the current theme.

    ```tsx
    "use client"

    import { useDarkMode } from "use-dark-mode"
    import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

    export default function ThemeToggle() {
      const { isDarkMode, toggle } = useDarkMode(false); // false defaults to system preference

      return (
        <Button onClick={toggle}>
          {isDarkMode ? "Light Mode" : "Dark Mode"}
        </Button>
      );
    }
    ```

    Then in your `layout.tsx` or root component:

    ```tsx
    import ThemeToggle from './ThemeToggle';

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode
    }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body className="bg-background">
            <ThemeToggle />
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      )
    }

    ```

    Or, if you have a `global.css` (or equivalent), then add `@tailwind base;` at the top.  That allows the `dark:` class to be applied to the HTML element as needed.

## Accessibility Best Practices

Shadcn/ui components are built with accessibility in mind, but it's important to understand how to use them correctly to ensure that your application is accessible to all users.

*   **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`) whenever possible.
*   **ARIA Attributes:**  Use ARIA attributes to provide additional information to assistive technologies.  Shadcn/ui components often include ARIA attributes by default, but you may need to add additional attributes depending on your specific use case.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
*   **Color Contrast:**  Ensure that there is sufficient color contrast between text and background colors.  Use a color contrast checker to verify that your color choices meet accessibility standards.
*   **Focus Indicators:**  Ensure that there are clear focus indicators for interactive elements.  Shadcn/ui components typically include focus indicators by default.
*   **Testing:**  Test your application with assistive technologies like screen readers to identify and fix accessibility issues.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Tailwind CSS Not Applying:**  Make sure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in your project.  Check your `tailwind.config.js` file and your `globals.css` file.
*   **Component Not Rendering:**  Double-check that you're importing the component correctly and that you're using the correct component alias.
*   **Styling Issues:**  Inspect the component in your browser's developer tools to identify any conflicting CSS rules.
*   **TypeScript Errors:**  Make sure that your TypeScript configuration is correct and that you're using the correct types for the component props.
