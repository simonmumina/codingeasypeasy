# How to Check Installed Windows Updates Using CMD (Command Prompt): A Comprehensive Guide

Keeping your Windows operating system up-to-date is crucial for security and stability. Regular updates patch vulnerabilities, improve performance, and add new features. While the graphical user interface (GUI) provides an easy way to view installed updates, the Command Prompt (CMD) offers a more direct and often faster method, especially for system administrators or those troubleshooting update-related issues. This comprehensive guide will walk you through several methods for checking installed Windows updates using CMD and PowerShell, providing clear instructions and practical examples.

## Why Use CMD to Check Windows Updates?

While the GUI is user-friendly, using CMD to check installed updates offers several advantages:

- **Speed:** CMD can often retrieve update information faster than navigating through the GUI.
- **Scripting and Automation:** You can incorporate CMD commands into scripts for automated update checks and reporting.
- **Remote Administration:** CMD allows you to check updates on remote computers (with proper permissions).
- **Troubleshooting:** Knowing which specific updates are installed is crucial for diagnosing issues related to particular patches.

## Method 1: Using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line)

WMIC is a powerful command-line interface for managing Windows systems. It provides a way to access information about the system's hardware, software, and configuration, including installed updates.

### The `wmic qfe list brief /format:table` Command

The primary command for listing installed updates using WMIC is `wmic qfe list brief /format:table`. Let's break down what each part of this command means:

- **`wmic`**: Invokes the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line tool.
- **`qfe`**: Stands for "Quick Fix Engineering." In the context of WMIC, `qfe` refers to hotfixes and updates installed on the system.
- **`list brief`**: Specifies that you want to list the installed updates and only display a brief summary of information.
- **`/format:table`**: Formats the output as a table, making it easier to read.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:** Press the Windows key, type `cmd`, right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator." This is crucial, as you may not be able to access all update information without administrative privileges.

2.  **Execute the Command:** Type the following command in the Command Prompt window and press Enter:

    ```plaintext
    wmic qfe list brief /format:table
    ```

3.  **Review the Output:** The Command Prompt will display a table listing the installed updates. The table typically includes the following columns:

    - **Caption:** A descriptive name for the update.
    - **CSName:** The computer name.
    - **Description:** A short description of the update.
    - **HotFixID:** The Knowledge Base (KB) article number associated with the update (e.g., KB5031354). This is the most important piece of information for identifying the specific update.
    - **InstalledOn:** The date the update was installed.

**Example Output:**

```
Caption                               CSName        Description      HotFixID   InstalledOn
Security Update for Windows 10 (KB5031354) DESKTOP-XXXXXXX Update             KB5031354  10/26/2024
Update for Windows 10 (KB5005635)       DESKTOP-XXXXXXX Update             KB5005635  09/15/2024
```

**Interpreting the Output:**

- The `HotFixID` column is the key to understanding which updates are installed. You can use this ID to search for more information about the update on Microsoft's website.

### Exporting the Update List to a File

You can redirect the output of the `wmic qfe list brief /format:table` command to a text file for later review or analysis.

**Command:**

```plaintext
wmic qfe list brief /format:table > updates.txt
```

This command will create a file named `updates.txt` in the current directory (usually `C:\Windows\System32` when running as admin) containing the table of installed updates. You can then open this file with any text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, etc.). To save it in a different directory add the full path, example: `wmic qfe list brief /format:table > C:\users\youruser\documents\updates.txt`. Replace `youruser` with your actual username.

## Method 2: Using PowerShell

PowerShell is a more advanced command-line shell and scripting language than CMD. It offers more flexibility and features for managing Windows systems.

### The `Get-HotFix` Cmdlet

PowerShell provides the `Get-HotFix` cmdlet, which is specifically designed to retrieve a list of installed updates.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator:** Press the Windows key, type `powershell`, right-click on "Windows PowerShell," and select "Run as administrator."

2.  **Execute the Command:** Type the following command in the PowerShell window and press Enter:

    ```powershell
    Get-HotFix
    ```

3.  **Review the Output:** PowerShell will display a list of installed updates. The output typically includes the following properties:

    - **Source:** The name of the computer the hotfix is installed on.
    - **Description:** A brief description of the hotfix, usually containing the word "Update".
    - **HotFixID:** The KB article number associated with the update (e.g., KB5031354).
    - **InstalledBy:** The user who installed the update (usually "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM").
    - **InstalledOn:** The date the update was installed.

**Example Output:**

```powershell
Source        Description      HotFixID      InstalledBy          InstalledOn
------        -----------      --------      -----------          -----------
DESKTOP-XXXXXXX Update             KB5031354     NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM 10/26/2024 12:00:00 AM
DESKTOP-XXXXXXX Update             KB5005635     NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM 09/15/2024 12:00:00 AM
```

**Filtering the Output:**

You can filter the output of `Get-HotFix` to display only specific properties. For example, to display only the `HotFixID` and `InstalledOn` properties, use the following command:

```powershell
Get-HotFix | Select-Object HotFixID, InstalledOn
```

**Example Filtered Output:**

```powershell
HotFixID    InstalledOn
--------    -----------
KB5031354   10/26/2024 12:00:00 AM
KB5005635   09/15/2024 12:00:00 AM
```

### Exporting the Update List to a CSV File

PowerShell makes it easy to export the update list to a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, which can be opened in programs like Excel or Google Sheets.

**Command:**

```powershell
Get-HotFix | Export-Csv -Path "C:\users\youruser\documents\updates.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

**Explanation:**

- `Get-HotFix`: Retrieves the list of installed updates.
- `Export-Csv`: Exports the output to a CSV file.
- `-Path "C:\users\youruser\documents\updates.csv"`: Specifies the path and filename for the CSV file. Replace `C:\users\youruser\documents\updates.csv` with your desired location and filename. **Important:** replace `youruser` with your actual username.
- `-NoTypeInformation`: Excludes type information from the CSV file, making it cleaner and easier to read.

## Method 3: Querying a Remote Computer with PowerShell

PowerShell's power extends to querying remote machines (assuming you have the appropriate permissions). This is incredibly useful for system administrators.

**Command:**

```powershell
Get-HotFix -ComputerName "RemoteComputerName"
```

**Explanation:**

- `Get-HotFix`: Retrieves the list of installed updates.
- `-ComputerName "RemoteComputerName"`: Specifies the name of the remote computer to query. Replace `"RemoteComputerName"` with the actual hostname or IP address of the remote machine.

**Example:**

```powershell
Get-HotFix -ComputerName "Server01"
```

**Important Considerations for Remote Queries:**

- **Permissions:** You need to have administrative privileges on the remote computer to successfully run this command.
- **Firewall:** The Windows Firewall on the remote computer must allow PowerShell remoting (or you may need to configure specific ports for WMIC).
- **PSRemoting:** PowerShell remoting needs to be enabled on the remote computer. You can enable it by running the following command on the remote machine (as an administrator): `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`
