# @mantine/colors-generator: Crafting Custom Color Schemes for Your Mantine UI Applications

Mantine is a fantastic React UI library that provides a rich set of components and features to build modern web applications. One of its strongest points is its theming capabilities, allowing developers to customize the look and feel of their applications with ease. However, creating a consistent and aesthetically pleasing color palette can sometimes be challenging. This is where `@mantine/colors-generator` comes in.

This article explores the `@mantine/colors-generator` package, demonstrating how to leverage it to create custom color schemes tailored to your specific needs, ensuring a harmonious and professional design for your Mantine-based projects.

## What is @mantine/colors-generator?

`@mantine/colors-generator` is a utility package that helps you generate a full color palette from a single base color. It's designed specifically to work with Mantine's color system, producing a set of ten shades (0-9) that can be used directly in your Mantine theme. This greatly simplifies the process of creating custom color schemes, ensuring that all shades are visually consistent and work well together. It helps you build a foundation for a robust design system.

## Why use @mantine/colors-generator?

- **Consistency:** Creates a consistent range of color shades from a single base color. This eliminates guesswork and ensures visual harmony across your application.
- **Efficiency:** Saves time and effort compared to manually defining each color shade. You can generate the entire palette with a single function call.
- **Mantine Integration:** Generates a color object that is directly compatible with Mantine's theme system. This allows for seamless integration into your application's styling.
- **Customization:** Provides options to adjust the generated shades to fine-tune the palette to your preferences.
- **Improved Design System:** Easier to manage and maintain your color scheme leading to a healthier design system.

## Installation

Before you start, you'll need to have a Mantine project set up. If you don't have one already, you can create a new project using `create-react-app` or a similar tool.

Once you have a project, you can install `@mantine/colors-generator` using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install @mantine/colors-generator
# or
yarn add @mantine/colors-generator
```

## Basic Usage

The core function of `@mantine/colors-generator` is `generateColors`. This function takes a base color (in hex format) as input and returns an array of ten color shades.

Here's a simple example:

```plaintext
import { generateColors } from '@mantine/colors-generator'

const primaryColor = '#228BE6' // Mantine's primary color
const primaryColors = generateColors(primaryColor)

console.log(primaryColors)
// Output:
// [
//   '#E5F3FB',
//   '#B0D5F2',
//   '#7BB8E9',
//   '#469AE0',
//   '#228BE6',  // Base color
//   '#1E65B7',
//   '#1A3E87',
//   '#161758',
//   '#120029',
//   '#0E0000'
// ]
```

As you can see, `generateColors` returns an array of ten hex color codes, ranging from a light tint to a dark shade of your base color. The base color itself will always be at index 4 in the generated array.

## Integrating with Mantine Theme

Now that you have a color palette, you can integrate it into your Mantine theme. The `@mantine/core` package provides a `MantineProvider` component that allows you to customize the theme of your application.

Here's how to use your generated colors in the `MantineProvider`:

```plaintext
import { MantineProvider, createTheme } from '@mantine/core'
import { generateColors } from '@mantine/colors-generator'

const primaryColor = '#7950F2' // A vibrant purple
const primaryColors = generateColors(primaryColor)

const theme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    primary: primaryColors,
  },
  primaryColor: 'primary', // Use the new 'primary' color
})

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme} withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS>
      {/* Your application content */}
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

In this example, we define a custom color palette using `generateColors` and then assign it to the `colors.primary` property of the theme. We also set `primaryColor` to `'primary'` to tell Mantine to use our new palette for the default primary color. This ensures that Mantine components that use the primary color will now use the shades you generated.

## Using the Generated Colors in Components

Once your theme is configured, you can easily use your custom colors in your Mantine components. You can access the colors directly from the theme using the `useMantineTheme` hook.

```plaintext
import { Button, useMantineTheme } from '@mantine/core'

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useMantineTheme()

  return (
    <Button color="primary" variant="filled">
      Click Me
    </Button>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `Button` component will use the `primary` color palette defined in your theme. The `variant="filled"` prop will apply the primary color to the background of the button.

You can also use the specific shades of your color palette by accessing them directly through the `theme.colors` object:

```plaintext
import { Text, useMantineTheme } from '@mantine/core'

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useMantineTheme()

  return (
    <Text color={theme.colors.primary[6]}>
      This text will use a darker shade of the primary color.
    </Text>
  )
}
```

This example will render the text using the 7th shade (index 6) of your primary color palette. Remember that indexes go from 0 (lightest) to 9 (darkest).

## Advanced Customization Options

`@mantine/colors-generator` also offers advanced customization options to fine-tune the generated shades. While not directly exposed through the main `generateColors` function, you can use libraries like `chroma-js` or manipulate the generated hex codes manually to achieve specific color variations.

For instance, if you want to create a palette where the lighter shades are more saturated, you can adjust the HSL values of the generated colors using `chroma-js`.

```plaintext
import { generateColors } from '@mantine/colors-generator'
import chroma from 'chroma-js'

const primaryColor = '#228BE6'
const primaryColors = generateColors(primaryColor)

const adjustedPrimaryColors = primaryColors.map((color, index) => {
  if (index < 5) {
    // Adjust lighter shades
    const chromaColor = chroma(color)
    return chromaColor.saturate(0.2).hex() // Increase saturation by 20%
  }
  return color
})

console.log(adjustedPrimaryColors)
```

This example uses `chroma-js` to increase the saturation of the lighter shades (index 0-4) by 20%. You can experiment with other HSL properties like lightness and hue to achieve your desired color variations. Remember to install `chroma-js`: `npm install chroma-js`.

## Best Practices

- **Choose a good base color:** The quality of your generated color palette depends heavily on the initial base color. Select a color that aligns with your brand identity and overall design aesthetic.
- **Consider accessibility:** Ensure that your color combinations provide sufficient contrast for readability, especially for text and interactive elements. Tools like WebAIM's contrast checker can help you evaluate color contrast ratios.
- **Test your palette:** Apply your generated colors to various components and scenarios within your application to see how they look and feel in context.
- **Maintain consistency:** Once you've established a color palette, stick to it! Avoid using too many different colors, as this can lead to a visually cluttered and inconsistent design.
- **Document your theme:** Document your color palette and theme settings in your project's documentation. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain your application's styling.

## Alternatives

While `@mantine/colors-generator` is an excellent tool for generating Mantine-compatible color palettes, there are other alternatives available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

- **Coolors.co:** An online color palette generator that allows you to explore, create, and save color palettes. While not specific to Mantine, you can easily export the colors in hex format and integrate them into your Mantine theme.
- **Adobe Color:** Another popular online color palette generator that offers a wide range of features, including color harmony rules and accessibility checks.
- **Manual Color Selection:** While more time-consuming, manually selecting each color shade allows for the greatest degree of control and customization. You can use design tools like Figma or Sketch to experiment with different color combinations.
- **Other libraries focused on color manipulation:** As seen earlier, using libraries like `chroma-js` or `tinycolor2` give you fine-grained control over color transformations.

## Conclusion

`@mantine/colors-generator` is a valuable tool for anyone building applications with Mantine UI. It simplifies the process of creating custom color schemes, ensuring consistency and improving the overall design aesthetic of your application. By understanding the basics of `generateColors` and integrating it into your Mantine theme, you can unlock the full potential of Mantine's theming capabilities and create truly unique and professional user interfaces. Remember to consider accessibility, test your palette thoroughly, and document your theme to ensure a maintainable and consistent design system.
