# Web 1.0 vs Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0: Understanding the Evolution of the Internet

The internet has undergone a dramatic transformation since its inception.  From the simple, static pages of Web 1.0 to the interactive, social platforms of Web 2.0, and now towards the decentralized and semantic vision of Web 3.0, the evolution of the web continues to reshape how we interact with information and each other. This comprehensive guide breaks down the key differences between these three eras, exploring their characteristics, technologies, and potential impact.

## Web 1.0: The Read-Only Web (1991-2004)

Web 1.0, often referred to as the "Static Web," was the first iteration of the internet as we know it.  It was characterized by its simplicity, limited interactivity, and primarily read-only experience for users. Think of it as a digital library or a collection of interconnected brochures.

**Key Characteristics of Web 1.0:**

*   **Static Pages:** Websites were predominantly built using static HTML, lacking dynamic content or interactive features.
*   **Limited User Interaction:** User participation was minimal.  The focus was on consuming information rather than contributing. Guestbooks and simple contact forms were the main exceptions.
*   **Centralized Content:** Content was typically created and controlled by website owners.
*   **Frames:** The use of HTML framesets to divide web pages into multiple independent sections.  (Remember those?)
*   **Low Bandwidth:** Limited bandwidth impacted the design and functionality of websites, leading to simpler designs.
*   **Lack of Javascript (Initially):**  Early Web 1.0 websites relied heavily on HTML for structure and presentation.  Javascript's role was limited or non-existent in many cases.

**Technology Stack of Web 1.0:**

*   **HTML:** Primarily used for structuring content.
*   **HTTP:** The protocol for transferring web pages.
*   **Early CSS:** Limited use of CSS for basic styling.
*   **Image Formats:** GIFs and JPEGs for static images.

**Example of Web 1.0 HTML Code:**

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web 1.0 Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple website built with HTML.</p>
  <img src="my_image.jpg" alt="My Image">
  <a href="another_page.html">Link to another page</a>
  <hr>
  <p>Copyright 2000</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Limitations of Web 1.0:**

*   **Lack of Interactivity:** Users were passive consumers of information.
*   **Limited Dynamic Content:** Websites were largely static and required manual updates.
*   **Difficult to Update:**  Making changes to websites required directly editing HTML files.
*   **Poor User Experience:** The limited functionality and design constraints resulted in a less engaging user experience.

*   **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB became popular for storing and managing large amounts of data.
*   **Server-Side Languages:**  PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java were widely used for building server-side applications.

**Example of Web 2.0 JavaScript with AJAX (Conceptual):**

```javascript
// Conceptual - jQuery Example (Illustrative)
$(document).ready(function() {
  $("#load-data").click(function() {
    $.ajax({
      url: "data.json",
      dataType: "json",
      success: function(data) {
        $("#data-container").html("<p>Name: " + data.name + "</p><p>Age: " + data.age + "</p>");
      },
      error: function() {
        $("#data-container").html("<p>Error loading data.</p>");
      }
    });
  });
});

// HTML snippet (e.g., index.html)
// <button id="load-data">Load Data</button>
// <div id="data-container"></div>
```

**Advantages of Web 2.0:**

*   **Increased User Engagement:** Users actively participate in content creation and sharing.
