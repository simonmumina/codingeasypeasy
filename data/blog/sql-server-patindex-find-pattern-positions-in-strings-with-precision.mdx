# SQL Server PATINDEX(): Find Pattern Positions in Strings with Precision

The `PATINDEX()` function in SQL Server is a powerful tool for locating the starting position of a specific pattern within a character string. Unlike simple string comparison, `PATINDEX()` allows you to use wildcards and character classes to perform more flexible and advanced searches within your data. This blog post provides a deep dive into `PATINDEX()`, covering its syntax, usage, practical examples, and potential pitfalls.

## What is PATINDEX()?

`PATINDEX()` returns the starting position of the _first_ occurrence of a pattern in a specified string. If the pattern is not found, it returns 0. The function uses a limited set of wildcards similar to the `LIKE` operator, making it ideal for searching for patterns rather than exact matches.

## Syntax

The syntax for `PATINDEX()` is straightforward:

```plaintext
PATINDEX ( '%pattern%', expression )
```

- **`'%pattern%'`**: This is the pattern you're searching for. It _must_ be enclosed in single quotes and can contain wildcards (see below). The surrounding `%` symbols are typically used to search for the pattern anywhere within the string. You can remove these if you want to search at the beginning or end of the string.
- **`expression`**: This is the string you are searching within. It can be a column name, a string literal, or any expression that evaluates to a character string data type.

## Wildcards Supported by PATINDEX()

`PATINDEX()` supports the following wildcards:

- **`%` (Percent Sign)**: Matches zero or more characters. This is the most common wildcard.
- **`_` (Underscore)**: Matches any single character.
- **`[]` (Square Brackets)**: Specifies a range of characters to match. For example, `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter. `[abc]` matches 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
- **`[^]` (Square Brackets with Caret)**: Specifies a range of characters to _not_ match. For example, `[^0-9]` matches any character that is not a digit.

## Basic Examples

Let's start with some simple examples to illustrate the basic usage of `PATINDEX()`:

```plaintext
-- Example 1: Find the position of 'SQL' in 'Learn SQL Server'
SELECT PATINDEX('%SQL%', 'Learn SQL Server');  -- Output: 7

-- Example 2: Find the position of 'Server' in 'Learn SQL Server'
SELECT PATINDEX('%Server%', 'Learn SQL Server'); -- Output: 11

-- Example 3:  Pattern not found
SELECT PATINDEX('%MySQL%', 'Learn SQL Server');  -- Output: 0

-- Example 4: Using a column from a table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, EmployeeName) VALUES
(1, 'John Smith'),
(2, 'Jane Doe'),
(3, 'Peter Jones');

SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, PATINDEX('%Smith%', EmployeeName) AS SmithPosition
FROM Employees;

--  Results:
--  EmployeeID | EmployeeName | SmithPosition
--  -----------|--------------|--------------
--  1          | John Smith   | 6
--  2          | Jane Doe     | 0
--  3          | Peter Jones  | 0
```

## Advanced Examples with Wildcards

`PATINDEX()` becomes much more powerful when using wildcards:

```plaintext
-- Example 5: Find the position of any word starting with 'S'
SELECT PATINDEX('%S%', 'Learn SQL Server'); -- Output: 7 (finds 'SQL')

-- Example 6: Find the position of any 3-letter word
SELECT PATINDEX('%___%', 'Learn SQL Server'); -- Output: 1 (finds 'Lea')

-- Example 7: Find the position of a digit
SELECT PATINDEX('%[0-9]%', 'Invoice Number: INV-2023-123'); -- Output: 20

-- Example 8: Find the position of any character that is not a letter
SELECT PATINDEX('%[^a-zA-Z]%', 'Hello World!'); -- Output: 6 (finds the space)

-- Example 9: Finding a specific character range
SELECT PATINDEX('%[aeiou]%', 'This is a test string'); -- Output: 3 (finds 'i' in 'This')

-- Example 10: Using underscore for single-character matching
SELECT PATINDEX('%L_arn%', 'Learn SQL Server'); --Output: 1
```

## Case Sensitivity

By default, `PATINDEX()` is case-insensitive. If you need a case-sensitive search, you'll need to use a case-sensitive collation. You can specify the collation in your query using the `COLLATE` clause.

```plaintext
-- Example 11: Case-insensitive search (default)
SELECT PATINDEX('%sql%', 'Learn SQL Server'); -- Output: 7

-- Example 12: Case-sensitive search
SELECT PATINDEX('%sql%', 'Learn SQL Server' COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS); -- Output: 0
SELECT PATINDEX('%SQL%', 'Learn SQL Server' COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS); -- Output: 7

-- or,  collating the expression

SELECT PATINDEX('%sql%', 'Learn SQL Server' COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS) -- Output: 7

SELECT PATINDEX('%sql%', 'Learn SQL Server' COLLATE Latin1_General_CS_AS); --Output 0
```

**Important:** The collation `Latin1_General_CS_AS` is just one example of a case-sensitive collation. The specific collation you need will depend on your server configuration and the characters you are working with. Use `sys.fn_helpcollations()` to get a list of available collations.

## Combining PATINDEX() with Other Functions

`PATINDEX()` can be combined with other SQL Server functions to create more complex queries:

```plaintext
-- Example 13: Extract the part of the string after the first number

SELECT
    SUBSTRING('Invoice Number: INV-2023-123', PATINDEX('%[0-9]%', 'Invoice Number: INV-2023-123'), LEN('Invoice Number: INV-2023-123'))
    AS NumberPart;
-- Output: 2023-123

-- Example 14: Check if a string contains a number
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN PATINDEX('%[0-9]%', 'Invoice Number: INV-2023-123') > 0 THEN 'Contains a Number'
        ELSE 'Does Not Contain a Number'
    END AS ContainsNumber;
-- Output: Contains a Number

-- Example 15: Using PATINDEX in a WHERE clause to filter results
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName
FROM Employees
WHERE PATINDEX('%John%', EmployeeName) > 0;

-- Output:
-- EmployeeID | EmployeeName
-- -----------|--------------
-- 1          | John Smith
```

## Performance Considerations

While `PATINDEX()` is a useful function, it's important to be aware of its potential performance impact, especially when used on large tables. Since it typically involves pattern matching, it can be less efficient than simple equality comparisons.

Here are some tips for optimizing `PATINDEX()` queries:

- **Use indexes effectively:** If you are using `PATINDEX()` in a `WHERE` clause, ensure that the column you are searching against is indexed. However, keep in mind that using leading wildcards (e.g., `'%pattern'`) will often prevent the index from being used. Trailing wildcards (`'pattern%'`) are generally more index-friendly.
- **Avoid leading wildcards when possible:** Queries with leading wildcards are often slower because the database cannot use an index to narrow down the search. Try to rewrite your query to avoid leading wildcards if possible.
- **Consider alternatives:** If you're performing simple "contains" checks, consider using `CHARINDEX()` if you don't need the wildcard functionality of `PATINDEX()`. `CHARINDEX()` can be faster for simple string searches. The `LIKE` operator, while similar, often benefits from better query optimization by the SQL Server engine.
- **Optimize the pattern:** Keep the pattern as specific as possible. For example, instead of `'%[0-9]%'`, consider using `'%[0-9][0-9][0-9]%'` if you know you're looking for a sequence of three digits. This might help the query optimizer narrow down the search.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting the `%` symbols:** A common mistake is forgetting to include the `%` symbols around the pattern. Without them, `PATINDEX()` will only find exact matches.
- **Incorrect wildcard usage:** Make sure you understand the meaning of each wildcard character. Using the wrong wildcard can lead to unexpected results.
- **Case sensitivity issues:** Remember that `PATINDEX()` is case-insensitive by default. If you need a case-sensitive search, you must specify a case-sensitive collation.
- **Performance on large tables:** Be mindful of the performance implications of using `PATINDEX()` on large tables, especially with leading wildcards.

## Conclusion

`PATINDEX()` is a versatile and essential function in SQL Server for performing pattern-based searches within strings. By understanding its syntax, wildcards, and potential performance considerations, you can leverage its power to extract valuable information from your data. Remember to experiment with different patterns and combine `PATINDEX()` with other SQL Server functions to create more sophisticated queries. Always be mindful of performance, especially when working with large datasets.
