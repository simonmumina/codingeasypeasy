# Retry and Circuit Breaker in Spring Boot: Resilience4j vs. Hystrix

In the world of microservices and distributed systems, handling failures gracefully is paramount.  Services often depend on each other, and when one service fails, it can trigger a cascading failure across the entire system.  Two crucial patterns for building fault-tolerant applications are **retry** and **circuit breaker**. This blog post will guide you through implementing these patterns in Spring Boot using two popular libraries: **Resilience4j** and **Hystrix**. We'll compare their features, provide code examples, and help you choose the right solution for your needs.

## Understanding Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns

Before diving into the code, let's define the core concepts:

*   **Retry:** The retry pattern involves automatically retrying a failed operation a certain number of times, potentially with increasing delays between retries. This is effective for transient failures like temporary network glitches or overloaded servers.

*   **Circuit Breaker:** The circuit breaker pattern acts as a guard against repeated failures. When a service consistently fails, the circuit breaker "opens," preventing further calls to the failing service. This allows the failing service to recover without overwhelming it with requests. After a defined period (the "half-open" state), the circuit breaker allows a few test calls to pass through. If these succeed, the circuit breaker "closes" and normal traffic resumes. If they fail, the circuit breaker remains open.

## Resilience4j: A Modern and Lightweight Choice

Resilience4j is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by Hystrix but designed to be more modular and maintainable. It offers modules for:

*   Retry
*   Circuit Breaker
*   Rate Limiter
*   Bulkhead
*   Time Limiter

Let's demonstrate how to implement retry and circuit breaker with Resilience4j in Spring Boot.

### 1. Add Resilience4j Dependency

First, add the necessary dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Or in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'io.github.resilience4j:resilience4j-spring-boot2'
```

### 2. Configure Resilience4j in `application.yml` or `application.properties`

You can configure the retry and circuit breaker behaviors in your Spring Boot configuration file. Here's an example using `application.yml`:

```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    configs:
      default:
        registerHealthIndicator: true
        failureRateThreshold: 50
        slidingWindowSize: 10
        minimumNumberOfCalls: 5
        waitDurationInOpenState: 10s
        permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState: 3
    instances:
      myServiceCircuitBreaker:
        baseConfig: default
  retry:
    configs:
      default:
        maxAttempts: 3
        waitDuration: 1s
        retryOnResult:
          - example.RetryResultPredicate
        retryOnException:
          - java.io.IOException
          - java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException
    instances:
      myServiceRetry:
        baseConfig: default
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`circuitbreaker.configs.default`**: Defines the default configuration for all circuit breakers.
    *   `registerHealthIndicator`:  Exposes a Spring Boot health indicator.
    *   `failureRateThreshold`: Percentage of failures before opening the circuit.
    *   `slidingWindowSize`: Number of calls to consider when calculating the failure rate.
    *   `minimumNumberOfCalls`: Minimum number of calls before the circuit breaker becomes active.
    *   `waitDurationInOpenState`: Time to wait in the open state before transitioning to half-open.
    *   `permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState`: Number of calls allowed in the half-open state.
*   **`circuitbreaker.instances.myServiceCircuitBreaker`**: Creates a specific circuit breaker instance named `myServiceCircuitBreaker` using the default configuration.
*   **`retry.configs.default`**: Defines the default configuration for all retry instances.
    *   `maxAttempts`: Maximum number of retry attempts.
    *   `waitDuration`: Initial delay between retries.
    *   `retryOnResult`: Custom predicates for retrying based on the returned result of the method.
    *   `retryOnException`:  List of exceptions that should trigger a retry.
*   **`retry.instances.myServiceRetry`**: Creates a specific retry instance named `myServiceRetry` using the default configuration.

### 3. Implement Retry and Circuit Breaker Using Annotations

Now, let's apply these configurations to a Spring Boot service method using annotations:

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;
import io.github.resilience4j.retry.annotation.Retry;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Retry(name = "myServiceRetry")
    @CircuitBreaker(name = "myServiceCircuitBreaker", fallbackMethod = "fallbackMethod")
    public String callExternalService() {
        // Simulate a potential failure
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
            throw new RuntimeException("External service failed!");
        }
        return "External service response";
    }

    public String fallbackMethod(RuntimeException ex) {
        // Handle the failure and return a fallback response
        System.err.println("Fallback method called: " + ex.getMessage());
        return "Fallback response: External service unavailable";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`@Retry(name = "myServiceRetry")`**:  Applies the retry configuration named `myServiceRetry` (defined in `application.yml`) to the `callExternalService` method.  The method will be retried up to 3 times with a 1-second delay between attempts if it throws an exception.
*   **`@CircuitBreaker(name = "myServiceCircuitBreaker", fallbackMethod = "fallbackMethod")`**: Applies the circuit breaker configuration named `myServiceCircuitBreaker` to the `callExternalService` method.  If the failure rate exceeds the configured threshold, the circuit will open, and subsequent calls will be immediately routed to the `fallbackMethod`.
*   **`fallbackMethod`**:  This method is called when the circuit breaker is open.  It allows you to provide a default response or perform alternative actions.  The `ex` parameter provides the exception that triggered the fallback. The fallback method MUST have the same return type as the decorated method AND accept either no arguments, or the same number of parameters and types as the decorated method, but including one exception type (or its superclass) as last parameter.

### 4.  Retry based on Result

Resilience4j allows you to retry based on the *result* of the method, not just on exceptions. To achieve this, you need to implement a `Predicate<String>` and register it as a bean:

```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("RetryResultPredicate")
public class RetryResultPredicate implements Predicate<String> {

    @Override
    public boolean test(String result) {
        return "ERROR".equals(result); // Retry if the result is "ERROR"
    }
}
```

And, as mentioned earlier, you need to define `retryOnResult` in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
resilience4j:
  retry:
    configs:
      default:
        maxAttempts: 3
        waitDuration: 1s
        retryOnResult:
          - example.RetryResultPredicate  # Fully qualified name of the predicate class
        retryOnException:
          - java.io.IOException
          - java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException
    instances:
      myServiceRetry:
        baseConfig: default
```

Now, if your service returns "ERROR", it will be retried.

### 5. Using the Service

Now you can autowire the `MyService` and call the `callExternalService` method:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        String response = myService.callExternalService();
        System.out.println("Service response: " + response);
    }
}
```

## Hystrix: A Mature but Less Maintained Option

Hystrix, developed by Netflix, was one of the first popular libraries for implementing the circuit breaker pattern. While mature and well-established, it's currently in maintenance mode, with no active feature development.  Netflix recommends using Resilience4j instead. However, understanding Hystrix is still valuable, especially if you're maintaining legacy systems.

### 1. Add Hystrix Dependency

Include the Hystrix dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Or in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix'
```

**Important:**  You'll also need to include the Spring Cloud dependency management plugin to manage the version of the Hystrix dependency.  Add this to your `pom.xml` in the `<dependencyManagement>` section:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Replace `${spring-cloud.version}` with a compatible Spring Cloud version (e.g., `Hoxton.SR9` for Spring Boot 2.3).  For Gradle, use the Spring Cloud dependency management plugin.

### 2. Enable Hystrix

Add the `@EnableCircuitBreaker` annotation to your main Spring Boot application class:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.EnableCircuitBreaker;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCircuitBreaker
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 3. Implement Hystrix Using Annotations

Now, let's protect a service method using Hystrix's `@HystrixCommand` annotation:

```java
import com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.javanica.annotation.HystrixCommand;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallbackMethod")
    public String callExternalService() {
        // Simulate a potential failure
        if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
            throw new RuntimeException("External service failed!");
        }
        return "External service response";
    }

    public String fallbackMethod() {
        // Handle the failure and return a fallback response
        System.err.println("Fallback method called!");
        return "Fallback response: External service unavailable";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallbackMethod")`**:  Wraps the `callExternalService` method with a Hystrix command.  If the method fails (throws an exception), Hystrix will invoke the `fallbackMethod`.
*   **`fallbackMethod`**:  This method provides a fallback response when the `callExternalService` method fails. The fallback method MUST have the same return type as the decorated method AND accept no arguments, or the same number of parameters and types as the decorated method, but including one exception type (or its superclass) as last parameter. In the example above, the fallback method is defined with no arguments for simplicity.  If your `callExternalService` method accepts arguments, your `fallbackMethod` should also accept the same arguments, plus an optional `Throwable` argument to access the exception that caused the failure.

### 4. Configure Hystrix (Optional)

You can customize Hystrix's behavior through configuration properties.  For example, to configure the circuit breaker settings:

```yaml
hystrix:
  command:
    default:
      circuitBreaker:
        requestVolumeThreshold: 10
        errorThresholdPercentage: 50
        sleepWindowInMilliseconds: 5000
```

**Explanation:**

*   `requestVolumeThreshold`:  The minimum number of requests that must be made within a rolling window before the circuit breaker starts tracking metrics.
*   `errorThresholdPercentage`: The percentage of errors that must occur within a rolling window to trigger the circuit breaker to open.
*   `sleepWindowInMilliseconds`: The amount of time (in milliseconds) that the circuit breaker will remain open before allowing a single test request to pass through.

### 5.  Testing Hystrix

Using the same example application code, you can now run your Spring Boot application.  Hystrix will automatically manage the execution of your service methods and invoke the fallback method if failures occur.

| **Community**    | Growing community, well-documented              | Mature community, but less active                 |

## Which One to Choose?

*   **Resilience4j:**  Generally recommended for new projects due to its active development, modularity, lightweight nature, and excellent support for retry-on-result and reactive programming.
*   **Hystrix:** Suitable for maintaining legacy systems that already use Hystrix.  Consider migrating to Resilience4j for long-term maintainability and access to newer features.

## Conclusion

Implementing retry and circuit breaker patterns is essential for building resilient and fault-tolerant Spring Boot applications. While both Resilience4j and Hystrix provide effective solutions, Resilience4j is the preferred choice for new projects due to its active development and superior features.  By understanding these patterns and libraries, you can create more robust and reliable microservices architectures. Remember to carefully configure your retry and circuit breaker settings based on the specific requirements and failure characteristics of your services.
