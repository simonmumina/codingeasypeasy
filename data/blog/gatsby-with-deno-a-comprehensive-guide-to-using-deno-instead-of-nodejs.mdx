# Gatsby with Deno: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Deno Instead of Node.js

Gatsby is a powerful, React-based static site generator that allows you to build blazing-fast websites. Traditionally, Gatsby projects rely heavily on Node.js for its runtime environment. However, with the rise of Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, developers are exploring the possibility of using Deno as a viable alternative.

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Gatsby project and configuring it to use Deno instead of Node.js. We'll explore the challenges, benefits, and practical steps involved in this transition.

## Why Use Deno with Gatsby?

Before we dive into the implementation, let's discuss why you might want to consider using Deno with Gatsby:

- **Security:** Deno's built-in security features, like explicit permissions, reduce the risk of malicious code execution. Unlike Node.js, Deno requires explicit permission to access the file system, network, and environment variables.
- **Modern JavaScript:** Deno supports modern JavaScript and TypeScript out of the box, eliminating the need for complex configuration with Babel or other transpilers.
- **TypeScript Support:** Deno has first-class TypeScript support, simplifying the development process for TypeScript developers.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Deno strives for browser compatibility, making it easier to write code that runs both on the server and in the browser.
- **Single Executable:** Deno is distributed as a single executable, making installation and management easier.
- **Module Management:** Deno uses ES Modules and URLs for module management, simplifying dependency management and eliminating the need for `npm` or `yarn`.

## Challenges and Considerations

While Deno offers several advantages, it's important to be aware of the challenges involved in using it with Gatsby:

- **Ecosystem Compatibility:** The Node.js ecosystem is vast, and many Gatsby plugins and dependencies rely on Node.js APIs. Adapting or finding alternatives for these dependencies can be time-consuming.
- **Limited Plugin Support:** While the Deno community is growing, the number of Deno-specific Gatsby plugins is currently limited.
- **Build Process Modifications:** Gatsby's build process is designed with Node.js in mind. You'll likely need to modify the build scripts and configuration to work with Deno.
- **Community Support:** The Deno community is smaller than the Node.js community, which might make it harder to find solutions to specific problems.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Deno with Gatsby

Now, let's get to the practical steps of setting up a Gatsby project to use Deno.

**1. Install Deno:**

First, you need to install Deno on your system. Follow the official installation instructions on the [Deno website](https://deno.land/). You'll typically use a command like this in your terminal:

```plaintext
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

This will download and install the Deno runtime and add it to your system's path. Make sure to restart your terminal or source your shell configuration to ensure Deno is available.

**2. Create a New Gatsby Project (using Node.js initially):**

Although we aim to use Deno, the initial project setup is more straightforward using the standard Gatsby CLI with Node.js. This will give us a baseline project structure.

```plaintext
npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new my-deno-gatsby-site
cd my-deno-gatsby-site
```

**3. Project Structure and Node.js Dependencies:**

Observe the generated `package.json` file. You'll see standard Gatsby dependencies and devDependencies. These are primarily used by `gatsby-cli` and build scripts. We'll need to figure out how to manage these using Deno. Keep this file for now, but we'll aim to reduce its dependence later.

**4. Migrating Build Scripts to Deno:**

This is the core step. We need to replace the npm scripts in `package.json` with Deno-compatible commands. This will typically involve creating Deno scripts (e.g., `dev.ts`, `build.ts`) that perform the equivalent actions.

Here's an example of a `dev.ts` script (replace the existing `develop` script in `package.json`):

```plaintext
// dev.ts
import { existsSync } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.205.0/fs/mod.ts'

const GATSBY_CLI = 'node_modules/.bin/gatsby'

const command = [
  'deno',
  'run',
  '--allow-all', // Be cautious with `--allow-all`! Restrict permissions as much as possible.
  GATSBY_CLI,
  'develop',
  '--host',
  '0.0.0.0',
]

const process = Deno.run({ cmd: command })

const status = await process.status()

if (!status.success) {
  console.error('Gatsby develop failed.')
  Deno.exit(1)
}

Deno.exit(0)
```

**Important:**

- **Permissions:** The `--allow-all` flag is used for simplicity in this example, but it's **highly recommended** to restrict permissions to only what's necessary. Use `--allow-read`, `--allow-write`, `--allow-net`, etc., with specific paths and URLs.
- **GATSBY_CLI Path:** This assumes `gatsby` is installed in `node_modules`.
- **TypeScript:** This script is written in TypeScript. Ensure your Deno is configured to handle TypeScript.

Similarly, create a `build.ts` script to replace the `build` script in `package.json`:

```plaintext
// build.ts
import { existsSync } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.205.0/fs/mod.ts'

const GATSBY_CLI = 'node_modules/.bin/gatsby'

const command = [
  'deno',
  'run',
  '--allow-all', // Be cautious with `--allow-all`! Restrict permissions as much as possible.
  GATSBY_CLI,
  'build',
]

const process = Deno.run({ cmd: command })

const status = await process.status()

if (!status.success) {
  console.error('Gatsby build failed.')
  Deno.exit(1)
}

Deno.exit(0)
```

And a `serve.ts` script to replace the `serve` script in `package.json`:

```plaintext
// serve.ts
import { existsSync } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.205.0/fs/mod.ts'

const GATSBY_CLI = 'node_modules/.bin/gatsby'

const command = [
  'deno',
  'run',
  '--allow-all', // Be cautious with `--allow-all`! Restrict permissions as much as possible.
  GATSBY_CLI,
  'serve',
]

const process = Deno.run({ cmd: command })

const status = await process.status()

if (!status.success) {
  console.error('Gatsby serve failed.')
  Deno.exit(1)
}

Deno.exit(0)
```

**5. Modify `package.json` to use Deno scripts:**

Update your `package.json` to use the Deno scripts you created. Replace the original npm scripts with these:

```plaintext
{
  "name": "my-deno-gatsby-site",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "description": "A simple Gatsby site using Deno",
  "keywords": ["gatsby", "deno"],
  "scripts": {
    "develop": "deno run --allow-all dev.ts",
    "start": "deno run --allow-all serve.ts",
    "build": "deno run --allow-all build.ts",
    "serve": "deno run --allow-all serve.ts",
    "clean": "gatsby clean"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^5.0.0",
    "gatsby-plugin-image": "^3.0.0",
    "gatsby-plugin-sharp": "^5.0.0",
    "gatsby-source-filesystem": "^5.0.0",
    "gatsby-transformer-sharp": "^5.0.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

**6. Running the Project:**

Now, you should be able to run your Gatsby project using Deno. In your terminal, execute:

```plaintext
npm run develop
```

This will execute the `develop` script in `package.json`, which in turn will run your `dev.ts` script using Deno. If everything is configured correctly, Gatsby should start in development mode.

**7. Adapting Gatsby Plugins:**

This is where things can get more complex. Many Gatsby plugins rely heavily on Node.js modules. You'll need to:

- **Identify Node.js Dependencies:** Determine which plugins are causing issues.
- **Find Deno Alternatives:** Look for Deno-compatible alternatives to the Node.js modules. Sometimes, you can use the [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) or [jspm.io](https://jspm.io/) CDNs to import Node.js modules as ES modules in Deno. However, this is not always reliable and may require polyfills.
- **Rewrite Plugins:** In some cases, you might need to rewrite or adapt existing plugins to work with Deno. This might involve using Deno's standard library for file system access, network requests, etc.

**Example: Using `fs` module with Deno's `std/fs`:**

If a plugin uses Node.js's `fs` module for file system operations, you can replace it with Deno's `std/fs` module:

```plaintext
// Node.js
// const fs = require('fs');
// fs.readFileSync('my-file.txt', 'utf8');

// Deno
import { readFileSync } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.205.0/fs/mod.ts'
const fileContent = readFileSync('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' })
```

**8. Leveraging Deno Modules Directly:**

You can also directly import and use Deno modules in your Gatsby components or pages. For example, to generate a UUID:

```plaintext
import { v4 } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.205.0/uuid/mod.ts'

function MyComponent() {
  const uuid = v4.generate()
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Generated UUID: {uuid}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**9. Addressing `require()` Statements:**

Deno doesn't support `require()` statements. You'll need to replace them with ES module `import` statements. This might require significant modifications to existing code. You might need to use tools like `jscodeshift` to automate some of these replacements.

**10. Minimizing `package.json` and Node.js dependencies**
As you convert the build and develop scripts over to Deno you can remove some of the `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. However it is very likely that `gatsby-cli` will still be required in the `node_modules` folder.

**Example Gatsby Config (gatsby-config.js)**

Because Gatsby runs through the `gatsby-cli` installed in the `node_modules` folder, the main `gatsby-config.js` file will still need to be formatted as a `module.exports = {}`. This is because the `gatsby-cli` parses the config file through Node.js.

```plaintext
/**
 * @type {import('gatsby').GatsbyConfig}
 */
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Deno Gatsby Site`,
    siteUrl: `https://www.yourdomain.tld`,
  },
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-image',
    'gatsby-plugin-sharp',
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-source-filesystem',
      options: {
        name: 'images',
        path: './src/images/',
      },
    },
    'gatsby-transformer-sharp',
  ],
}
```

## Conclusion

Using Deno with Gatsby is an ambitious undertaking. While it offers potential benefits in terms of security and modern JavaScript support, it also presents significant challenges related to ecosystem compatibility and build process modifications.

This guide provides a starting point for exploring this integration. Be prepared to invest time in adapting plugins, rewriting code, and troubleshooting issues. As the Deno ecosystem continues to grow, the process of using Deno with Gatsby will likely become easier. However, for now, it's best suited for developers who are comfortable with diving deep into the Gatsby build process and adapting to a more modern, secure runtime environment.
