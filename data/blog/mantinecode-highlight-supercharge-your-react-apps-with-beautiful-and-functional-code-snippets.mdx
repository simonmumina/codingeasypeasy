# @mantine/code-highlight: Supercharge Your React Apps with Beautiful and Functional Code Snippets

As developers, we often need to share code examples in our applications, whether it's in documentation, tutorials, or interactive demos.  Displaying raw code can be messy and hard to read.  That's where syntax highlighting comes in, making code more understandable and visually appealing.  Mantine UI, a popular React UI library, provides a powerful and easy-to-use solution for this with its `@mantine/code-highlight` package.

This blog post will guide you through using `@mantine/code-highlight` to effortlessly add beautifully syntax-highlighted code snippets to your React applications.  We'll cover installation, basic usage, customization options, accessibility considerations, and more.  Let's dive in!

## Why Choose @mantine/code-highlight?

Before we get into the implementation, let's understand why `@mantine/code-highlight` is a great choice for your code highlighting needs:

*   **Built on PrismJS:** It leverages the widely adopted PrismJS library for syntax highlighting, supporting a vast range of languages and themes.
*   **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the Mantine UI ecosystem, providing a consistent look and feel.
*   **Customizable:** Offers various props to control the appearance and behavior of the code snippets.
*   **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring your code snippets are usable by everyone.
*   **Theming:** Supports Mantine's theming system, allowing you to easily match the code highlighting to your application's overall design.
*   **Copy to Clipboard:** Includes a built-in copy to clipboard button for easy code sharing.

## Installation

First, you need to install the `@mantine/code-highlight` package along with its peer dependencies `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks`.  If you are not already using Mantine, you will also need `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/server`.

```bash
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/code-highlight @emotion/react @emotion/server
# or
yarn add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/code-highlight @emotion/react @emotion/server
# or
pnpm add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/code-highlight @emotion/react @emotion/server
```

## Basic Usage

The core component provided by `@mantine/code-highlight` is `<CodeHighlight>`.  Here's a simple example of how to use it:

```jsx
import { CodeHighlight } from '@mantine/code-highlight';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const code = `
function greet(name) {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
  `;

  return (
    <CodeHighlight code={code} language="javascript" />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example:

*   We import the `CodeHighlight` component.
*   We define a `code` string containing the code we want to highlight.
*   We pass the `code` and `language` props to the `CodeHighlight` component.  The `language` prop tells PrismJS which language to use for syntax highlighting.

## Supported Languages

PrismJS supports a vast array of languages. You can find a complete list on the [PrismJS website](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).  Commonly used languages include:

*   `javascript`
*   `python`
*   `java`
*   `html`
*   `css`
*   `jsx`
*   `tsx`
*   `json`
*   `bash`
*   `sql`

## Customizing the Appearance

The `@mantine/code-highlight` component offers several props to customize its appearance:

*   **`language` (string, required):** Specifies the programming language of the code.
*   **`code` (string, required):** The code snippet to highlight.
*   **`className` (string):**  Allows you to add custom CSS classes to the container element.
*   **`highlightLines` (string):** A string defining which lines of code to highlight.  Uses PrismJS's line highlight plugin syntax (e.g., `1,3-5`).
*   **`maxHeight` (number | string):**  Sets the maximum height of the component. If the code exceeds this height, a scrollbar will appear.
*   **`copyButtonProps` (object):** An object containing props to pass down to the copy button.
*   **`innerProps` (object):**  An object containing props to pass to the pre element (where the code is rendered). This allows very low-level customisation if needed.
*   **`withLineNumbers` (boolean):**  Displays line numbers next to the code. Defaults to `false`.
*   **`wrapLines` (boolean):** Wraps lines of code that exceed the container width. Defaults to `false`.
*   **`style` (object):** Apply inline styles to the component.

Let's look at some examples:

### Highlighting Specific Lines

```jsx
import { CodeHighlight } from '@mantine/code-highlight';

const code = `
function add(a, b) {
  // This line is important
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Another important line
`;

const MyComponent = () => (
  <CodeHighlight code={code} language="javascript" highlightLines="2,5" />
);
```

This will highlight lines 2 and 5 of the code.

### Setting a Maximum Height

```jsx
import { CodeHighlight } from '@mantine/code-highlight';

const longCode = `
// Long code example...
function veryLongFunction() {
  // ... many lines of code ...
  return 'result';
}
`.repeat(10); // Repeat the code to make it longer

const MyComponent = () => (
  <CodeHighlight code={longCode} language="javascript" maxHeight={200} />
);
```

This will set the maximum height of the code snippet to 200 pixels, adding a scrollbar if the code exceeds that height.

### Adding Line Numbers

```jsx
import { CodeHighlight } from '@mantine/code-highlight';

const code = `
function greet(name) {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}
`;

const MyComponent = () => (
  <CodeHighlight code={code} language="javascript" withLineNumbers />
);
```

This will display line numbers next to each line of code.

### Wrapping Lines

```jsx
import { CodeHighlight } from '@mantine/code-highlight';

const longCode = `
function veryLongFunctionWithAVeryLongNameThatExceedsTheContainerWidth() {
  return 'This is a very long line of code that will wrap to the next line.';
}
`;

const MyComponent = () => (
  <CodeHighlight code={longCode} language="javascript" wrapLines />
);
```

This will wrap lines of code that exceed the container width, preventing horizontal scrolling.

## Theming with Mantine

`@mantine/code-highlight` seamlessly integrates with Mantine's theming system.  The color scheme of the code snippet will automatically adapt to the current Mantine theme (light or dark).

You can also customize the theme further by overriding the styles using Mantine's `useMantineTheme` hook and the `className` prop to target specific elements.  However, keep in mind that `@mantine/code-highlight` itself doesn't provide pre-defined themes beyond the core PrismJS themes.  You'll need to load the appropriate CSS for your desired PrismJS theme.

## Loading PrismJS Themes

To use a specific PrismJS theme, you need to include its CSS file in your application. You can do this in a few ways:

1.  **Importing directly in your component:**

    ```jsx
    import '@mantine/core/styles.css'; // import mantine base styles
    import '@mantine/code-highlight/styles.css'; // import component styles
    import 'prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css'; // Import the Okaidia theme

    // ... rest of your component
    ```

    *Remember to install `prismjs`: `npm install prismjs` or `yarn add prismjs`.*

2.  **Adding to your main CSS file:**

    You can add `@import 'prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css';` to your application's main CSS file.  Make sure this import happens *after* any Mantine style imports to ensure proper overrides.

3.  **Using a CDN:**

    You can include the CSS file from a CDN in your HTML file:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/themes/prism-okaidia.min.css" integrity="sha512-mIs9kKbaw6JZFfCjh+mPq5xDGMnKUpxyixYUqE0IzJWJMGGUlBirvC4QixdNnltHJrr5iFuRy3dcZ9rltOxyQ==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
    ```

    *Make sure to choose a CDN that you trust and that provides a reliable service.*

Common PrismJS themes include:

*   `prism-okaidia.css`
*   `prism-tomorrow.css`
*   `prism-twilight.css`
*   `prism-dark.css`

Choose a theme that complements your application's overall design.

## Accessibility Considerations

`@mantine/code-highlight` provides a visually appealing way to display code, but it's important to consider accessibility.  Ensure that the code snippets are readable by users with visual impairments.

*   **Color Contrast:**  Choose a PrismJS theme with sufficient contrast between the text and background colors.  Use a tool like [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify contrast ratios.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** The copy button is focusable and navigable via the keyboard.
*   **Semantic HTML:** The component uses semantic HTML elements, which helps screen readers interpret the content correctly.

## Copy to Clipboard Functionality

`@mantine/code-highlight` includes a built-in copy to clipboard button, making it easy for users to copy the code snippet.  You can customize the appearance and behavior of the button using the `copyButtonProps` prop.

```jsx
import { CodeHighlight } from '@mantine/code-highlight';
import { Tooltip } from '@mantine/core';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const code = `
function greet(name) {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}
  `;

  return (
    <CodeHighlight
      code={code}
      language="javascript"
      copyButtonProps={{
        tooltip: <Tooltip label="Copy code" />,
        'aria-label': 'Copy code to clipboard',
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, we're customizing the `copyButtonProps` to add a tooltip and aria-label to the copy button for enhanced user experience and accessibility.  You can also change the icon, size, and other properties of the button.

## Example: Displaying a JSON Configuration

Here's a more complete example of displaying a JSON configuration:

```jsx
import { CodeHighlight, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
import '@mantine/code-highlight/styles.css';
import 'prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css';


const jsonConfig = `{
  "name": "My Application",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample configuration file",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "@mantine/core": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build"
  }
}`;

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS>
      <div>
        <h1>JSON Configuration</h1>
        <CodeHighlight
          code={jsonConfig}
          language="json"
          highlightLines="2,5-7"
          maxHeight={300}
          withLineNumbers
          wrapLines
        />
      </div>
    </MantineProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This example demonstrates how to display a JSON configuration with syntax highlighting, highlighted lines, line numbers, line wrapping, and a maximum height.  It also includes the necessary Mantine Provider to ensure proper styling.
