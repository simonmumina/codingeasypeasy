# Next.js Router: Programmatic Navigation Explained with Examples

Next.js provides a powerful and flexible routing system that allows you to build dynamic and performant web applications. While declarative routing with `<Link>` components is often sufficient, there are times when you need to control navigation programmatically. This blog post will delve into how to use the Next.js router programmatically, providing comprehensive examples and explanations to help you master this essential skill.

## What is Programmatic Navigation?

Programmatic navigation refers to controlling the navigation flow of your application using JavaScript code. Instead of relying solely on user clicks on `<Link>` components, you can trigger navigation events based on various factors, such as:

- Form submissions
- Authentication status
- API responses
- Dynamic content updates
- Conditional rendering
- Time-based redirects

## Why Use Programmatic Navigation?

Programmatic navigation offers several advantages:

- **Flexibility:** Implement complex navigation logic based on application state.
- **Dynamic Control:** Navigate users based on real-time data and events.
- **Improved User Experience:** Create seamless and intuitive navigation flows.
- **Enhanced Control:** Override default navigation behavior for specific scenarios.

## Getting Started: The `useRouter` Hook

The primary tool for programmatic navigation in Next.js is the `useRouter` hook, imported from `next/router`. This hook provides access to the Next.js router object, which contains methods and properties for controlling navigation.

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  // Now you can use the router object to navigate programmatically
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Core Router Methods

The `useRouter` hook gives you access to several crucial methods. Let's explore the most commonly used ones:

### 1. `router.push(url, as, options)`

The `router.push()` method navigates to a specified URL, adding the new URL to the browser history stack. This allows users to use the browser's back button to return to the previous page.

- **`url` (string | URL object):** The URL to navigate to. This can be an internal path (e.g., `/about`) or an external URL.
- **`as` (string, optional):** The URL that will be displayed in the browser address bar. This is useful for creating cleaner, SEO-friendly URLs or for cases where you want to mask the actual URL.
- **`options` (object, optional):** An object containing additional navigation options:
  - `shallow` (boolean, optional): If `true`, only updates the path of the current page without running `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps`. This is useful for updates that don't require fetching new data. Defaults to `false`.
  - `locale` (string, optional): Force a specific locale for this navigation.
  - `scroll` (boolean, optional): Controls whether or not to scroll to the top of the page after navigation. Defaults to `true`.

**Example: Navigating to a different page:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/products');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Products Page</button>
  );
}
```

**Example: Using `as` for a cleaner URL:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent({ productId }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push(`/product/[id]`, `/product/${productId}`); // 'url' is the actual file structure, 'as' is what the user sees
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>View Product</button>
  );
}
```

**Example: Using `shallow` routing:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    router.push(`/?count=${count + 1}`, undefined, { shallow: true });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <p>Query Param: {router.query.count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the `shallow` routing example, only the URL is updated. `getServerSideProps` (or `getStaticProps` if applicable) will _not_ be re-executed. This can improve performance if you're only changing a small part of the UI and don't need to re-fetch data. Note: if the page does _not_ have `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` defined, and you are using `shallow: true`, then the state will also not be re-populated on refresh.

### 2. `router.replace(url, as, options)`

The `router.replace()` method navigates to a specified URL, _replacing_ the current URL in the browser history stack. This means that the user cannot use the browser's back button to return to the previous page. This is useful for redirects or scenarios where you don't want the user to be able to navigate back.

The parameters for `router.replace()` are the same as `router.push()`:

- **`url` (string | URL object):** The URL to navigate to.
- **`as` (string, optional):** The URL that will be displayed in the browser address bar.
- **`options` (object, optional):** An object containing additional navigation options (including `shallow`, `locale`, and `scroll`).

**Example: Redirecting after a successful form submission:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyFormComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Simulate form submission
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Simulate API call

    router.replace('/success'); // Replace the form page with the success page
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 3. `router.back()`

The `router.back()` method navigates the user back to the previous page in the browser history. This is equivalent to clicking the browser's back button.

**Example: Creating a "Go Back" button:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleGoBack = () => {
    router.back();
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleGoBack}>Go Back</button>
  );
}
```

### 4. `router.forward()`

The `router.forward()` method navigates the user forward in the browser history. This is equivalent to clicking the browser's forward button (if one is available).

**Example: Creating a "Go Forward" button:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleGoForward = () => {
    router.forward();
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleGoForward}>Go Forward</button>
  );
}
```

### 5. `router.prefetch(url)`

The `router.prefetch()` method prefetches a page in the background, improving navigation speed when the user clicks a link or programmatically navigates to that page. This is a performance optimization technique that can significantly enhance the user experience.

**Example: Prefetching a page:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    router.prefetch('/about'); // Prefetch the /about page when the component mounts
  }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/about'); // Navigation will be faster because it was prefetched
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About Page</button>
  );
}
```

**Important Considerations for `prefetch`:**

- Prefetching only works for pages within your Next.js application.
- Be mindful of network bandwidth. Avoid prefetching too many pages at once, especially on low-bandwidth connections.
- Consider using `router.prefetch` conditionally based on user behavior or device capabilities.

### Router Properties

In addition to methods, the `useRouter` hook also exposes helpful properties:

- `router.pathname`: The current page's path, excluding the query string. (e.g., `/blog/[slug]`)
- `router.query`: An object containing the URL query parameters. (e.g., `{ slug: 'my-first-post', page: '2' }`)
- `router.asPath`: The path as it appears in the browser URL, including the query string. (e.g., `/blog/my-first-post?page=2`)
- `router.isReady`: A boolean indicating whether the router is ready to be used. It's important to check `router.isReady` before accessing properties like `router.query`, especially during initial page load, as they might be undefined.
- `router.basePath`: The base path for the application, if configured.
- `router.locale`: The currently active locale (if using internationalized routing).
- `router.locales`: An array of supported locales (if using internationalized routing).
- `router.defaultLocale`: The default locale (if using internationalized routing).

**Example: Accessing router properties:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (router.isReady) {
      console.log('Current Pathname:', router.pathname);
      console.log('Query Parameters:', router.query);
      console.log('Full URL:', router.asPath);
    }
  }, [router.isReady]);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Handling Router Events

The Next.js router also emits events that you can listen to for advanced control and customization. These events are:

- `routeChangeStart(url, { shallow })`: Fires when a route starts to change.
- `routeChangeComplete(url, { shallow })`: Fires after a route has successfully changed.
- `routeChangeError(err, url, { shallow })`: Fires if there is an error during route change.
- `beforeHistoryChange(url)`: Fires before changing the browser's history.
- `hashChangeStart(url)`: Fires when the hash part of the URL starts to change.
- `hashChangeComplete(url)`: Fires after the hash part of the URL has changed.

You can subscribe to these events using `router.events` within a `useEffect` hook.

**Example: Showing a loading indicator during route changes:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChangeStart = (url) => {
      console.log(`Loading route: ${url}`);
      setLoading(true);
    };

    const handleRouteChangeComplete = (url) => {
      setLoading(false);
    };

    const handleRouteChangeError = (err, url) => {
      console.error(`Error loading route: ${url}`, err);
      setLoading(false);
    };

    router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChangeStart);
    router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChangeComplete);
    router.events.on('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError);

    return () => {
      router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChangeStart);
      router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChangeComplete);
      router.events.off('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError);
    };
  }, [router]);

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {/* Your component content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Important:** Remember to clean up event listeners in the `useEffect`'s cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.

## Best Practices for Programmatic Navigation

- **Use `<Link>` components when possible:** For simple navigation between pages, prefer `<Link>` components as they provide automatic prefetching and accessibility benefits. Use programmatic navigation for more complex scenarios.
- **Handle errors:** Implement error handling for navigation operations, especially when relying on external data or APIs.
- **Consider user experience:** Design navigation flows that are intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Optimize performance:** Use `router.prefetch` to improve navigation speed and be mindful of the impact of navigation on application performance.
- **Test thoroughly:** Test your programmatic navigation logic to ensure it works as expected in different scenarios.
- **Check `router.isReady`:** Always verify `router.isReady` before accessing router properties, especially during initial page load. This prevents errors caused by accessing undefined values.
- **Use `shallow` routing cautiously:** While useful, `shallow` routing should be used when you are certain that the data on the page does not need to be re-fetched. Be careful with state consistency after a refresh.
- **Server Side Rendering (SSR) considerations:** The `useRouter` hook is designed for client-side use. If you need to access routing information during server-side rendering (e.g., in `getServerSideProps`), you'll typically receive the `context` object, which contains the `params` property for accessing route parameters.

## Conclusion
