# SQL Server DATENAME() Function: Extracting Date Parts with Precision (Examples & Guide)

The `DATENAME()` function in SQL Server is a powerful and versatile tool for extracting specific parts of a date or time value as a string. Unlike `DATEPART()`, which returns an integer representing the date part, `DATENAME()` returns the date part as a _character string_. This makes it exceptionally useful for formatting date and time information for display in reports, applications, and user interfaces.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the intricacies of the `DATENAME()` function, providing detailed explanations, practical examples, and optimization tips to help you leverage its capabilities effectively.

## Understanding the Syntax

The syntax for the `DATENAME()` function is straightforward:

```plaintext
DATENAME ( datepart , date )
```

Let's break down the components:

- **`datepart`**: This is the specific part of the date you want to extract. It can be one of the following predefined date part keywords. These are case-insensitive. Popular options include:

  - `year`, `yy`, `yyyy`: Year
  - `quarter`, `qq`, `q`: Quarter (1-4)
  - `month`, `mm`, `m`: Month
  - `dayofyear`, `dy`, `y`: Day of the year (1-366)
  - `day`, `dd`, `d`: Day of the month
  - `weekday`, `dw`, `w`: Day of the week (Sunday-Saturday, dependent on `SET DATEFIRST`)
  - `week`, `wk`, `ww`: Week of the year
  - `hour`, `hh`: Hour
  - `minute`, `mi`, `n`: Minute
  - `second`, `ss`, `s`: Second
  - `millisecond`, `ms`: Millisecond
  - `microsecond`, `mcs`: Microsecond
  - `nanosecond`, `ns`: Nanosecond
  - `TZoffset`, `tz`: Time Zone Offset (e.g., '+00:00')
  - `ISO_WEEK`, `isowk`, `isoww`: ISO week

- **`date`**: This is the date or time value from which you want to extract the date part. This can be a date literal, a column containing date/time data, or an expression that evaluates to a date/time value. Valid data types include `date`, `datetime`, `datetime2`, `smalldatetime`, `datetimeoffset`.

## Practical Examples

Let's illustrate the usage of `DATENAME()` with several practical examples:

**1. Extracting the Month Name:**

```plaintext
SELECT DATENAME(month, '2024-03-15'); -- Returns 'March'
```

This query extracts the month name from the date '2024-03-15', resulting in the string "March".

**2. Getting the Day of the Week:**

```plaintext
SELECT DATENAME(weekday, '2024-02-29'); -- Returns 'Thursday' (on a leap year)
SELECT DATENAME(weekday, GETDATE()); -- Returns the current day of the week
```

These queries retrieve the day of the week for a specific date or the current date, returning strings like "Monday," "Tuesday," etc. The output depends on the `SET DATEFIRST` setting, which determines the first day of the week (default is Sunday).

**3. Retrieving the Quarter:**

```plaintext
SELECT DATENAME(quarter, '2024-05-20'); -- Returns '2'
SELECT DATENAME(quarter, '2024-12-31'); -- Returns '4'
```

This returns the quarter of the year as a string ("1", "2", "3", or "4").

**4. Extracting the Year:**

```plaintext
SELECT DATENAME(year, '2023-11-08'); -- Returns '2023'
```

This query extracts the year as a string.

**5. Using with a Table Column:**

Suppose you have a table called `Orders` with a column named `OrderDate` of type `datetime`:

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderDate DATETIME
);

INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, OrderDate) VALUES
(1, '2024-01-10'),
(2, '2024-02-15'),
(3, '2024-03-20');

SELECT
    OrderID,
    OrderDate,
    DATENAME(month, OrderDate) AS OrderMonth,
    DATENAME(year, OrderDate) AS OrderYear
FROM Orders;
```

This query extracts the month and year from the `OrderDate` column for each order. The `AS` keyword creates aliases for the resulting columns, making them easier to understand.

**6. Combining with other string functions:**

`DATENAME` returns a string, so it can be combined with other string functions:

```plaintext
SELECT 'The month is ' + DATENAME(month, GETDATE()); -- Returns 'The month is February' (assuming it's February)
```

**7. Working with `DATETIME2` and `DATETIMEOFFSET` Data Types:**

`DATENAME()` works seamlessly with the more modern `DATETIME2` and `DATETIMEOFFSET` data types, providing access to finer-grained time information:

```plaintext
DECLARE @datetime2Value DATETIME2 = '2024-02-29 14:30:45.1234567';
DECLARE @datetimeoffsetValue DATETIMEOFFSET = '2024-02-29 14:30:45.1234567 +05:30';

SELECT
    DATENAME(millisecond, @datetime2Value) AS Millisecond,
    DATENAME(microsecond, @datetime2Value) AS Microsecond,
    DATENAME(nanosecond, @datetime2Value) AS Nanosecond,
    DATENAME(TZoffset, @datetimeoffsetValue) AS TimeZoneOffset;
```

**8. Using `ISO_WEEK` (ISO 8601 Week):**

The `ISO_WEEK` datepart allows you to determine the week number according to the ISO 8601 standard. This standard defines the first week of the year as the week containing the first Thursday of that year.

```plaintext
SELECT DATENAME(ISO_WEEK, '2024-01-01'); -- Returns '1'
SELECT DATENAME(ISO_WEEK, '2023-12-31'); -- Returns '52'
SELECT DATENAME(ISO_WEEK, '2024-12-31'); -- Returns '1' (because 2024-12-31 falls within ISO Week 1 of 2025)
```

## Considerations and Best Practices

- **`SET DATEFIRST`:** Be aware of the `SET DATEFIRST` setting, as it affects the value returned for `weekday`. This setting determines which day is considered the first day of the week (1-7, representing Sunday through Saturday by default). If your application relies on a specific day of the week being numbered consistently, explicitly set `DATEFIRST` at the beginning of your session.

  ```plaintext
  SET DATEFIRST 7;  -- Sets Sunday as the first day of the week.
  SELECT DATENAME(weekday, '2024-03-03'); -- Will always return 'Sunday' with this setting
  ```

- **Performance:** While `DATENAME()` is generally efficient, using it in the `WHERE` clause of a large table can impact performance. Consider using a computed column (especially if the computed column is persisted) or indexing a pre-calculated date part if you frequently filter based on a date part extracted using `DATENAME()`.

- **Data Types:** Ensure that the `date` argument is a valid date or time data type. Passing an invalid value will result in an error.

- **Localization:** The output of `DATENAME()` is affected by the language settings of the SQL Server instance. The month names and day names will be returned in the currently configured language. To ensure consistent results, consider setting the language explicitly:

  ```plaintext
  SET LANGUAGE 'French';
  SELECT DATENAME(month, '2024-03-15'); -- Returns 'mars'
  SET LANGUAGE 'English'; -- Restore to default
  ```

- **Alternatives:** While `DATENAME` returns a string representation, `DATEPART` returns an integer representation of the date part. `DATEPART` is often faster if you only need the numerical value and don't need the string representation. `FORMAT` is another function which offers a lot of flexibility in how dates are formatted, but can be slower than `DATENAME` or `DATEPART`.

## Conclusion

The `DATENAME()` function is an essential tool in SQL Server for extracting and formatting date parts as strings. By understanding its syntax, date part options, and considerations, you can effectively use it to manipulate and present date and time information in your applications and reports. Remember to consider performance implications, localization settings, and `DATEFIRST` to ensure accurate and efficient use of this powerful function.
