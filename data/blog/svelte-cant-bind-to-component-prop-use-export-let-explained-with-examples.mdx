# Svelte: Can't Bind to Component Prop? Use `export let` Explained with Examples

Svelte makes building interactive web applications a breeze, but sometimes you might encounter a frustrating error: "Can't bind to component prop."  This usually happens when you're trying to use two-way binding directly with a component prop that hasn't been explicitly declared as such.  This guide will explain why this happens and, more importantly, how to fix it using `export let`.

## Understanding Component Props in Svelte

In Svelte, component props are simply variables that you can pass data into from a parent component.  Think of them as arguments to a function.  However, unlike regular variables within a component, props need to be explicitly declared if you want them to be used with certain Svelte features, especially two-way binding.

### The Importance of `export let`

The `export let` syntax in Svelte is the key to correctly declaring a component prop that can be both read from and written to by the parent component (or by the child component itself).  When you declare a prop with `export let`, you're essentially telling Svelte: "This variable is a prop, and I want to be able to potentially update it from the outside."

**Why not just `let`?**

Using a simple `let` declaration only creates a local variable within the component. The parent component can still pass a value as an initial prop to this component, but there will be no linkage between them. The parent component cannot directly update the local variable.

## The "Can't Bind to Component Prop" Error: A Practical Example

Let's illustrate this with a common scenario.  Imagine you have a parent component that wants to control the value of a text input within a child component.

**Parent Component (App.svelte):**

```svelte
<script>
  import InputComponent from './InputComponent.svelte';

  let inputValue = '';
</script>

<InputComponent bind:value={inputValue} />

<p>Value in App.svelte: {inputValue}</p>
```

**Child Component (InputComponent.svelte) - INCORRECT:**

```svelte
<script>
  let value; // Just a local variable. This won't work!
</script>

<input type="text" {value} />
```

If you run this code, you'll likely see the "Can't bind to component prop" error in your browser's console.  Why? Because `value` in `InputComponent.svelte` is not declared as a prop that can be bound to.  It's just a regular, local variable.

## The Solution: Using `export let`

To fix the error and enable two-way binding, you need to change the declaration of `value` in the `InputComponent.svelte` file to use `export let`:

**Child Component (InputComponent.svelte) - CORRECT:**

```svelte
<script>
  export let value = ''; // Now it's a bindable prop!
</script>

<input type="text" bind:value={value} />
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`export let value = '';`**: This line does several important things:
    *   **`export`**:  Makes the `value` variable a publicly accessible prop for the component.
    *   **`let`**:  Declares `value` as a variable that can be reassigned. This is crucial for two-way binding to work.
    *   **`= ''`**:  Sets an initial default value for the prop. This is generally good practice to avoid undefined values.

With this change, the code will now work correctly.  The `App.svelte` component can now directly update the `value` of the input field in `InputComponent.svelte`, and vice versa. When the user types in the input field, the `inputValue` in `App.svelte` is automatically updated.

## Understanding Svelte's Two-Way Binding

Svelte's `bind:` directive provides a convenient way to achieve two-way data binding.  It's essentially shorthand for a combination of setting the prop and listening for an event to update the prop in the parent component.

Under the hood, when you use `bind:value` with a component prop, Svelte automatically:

1.  **Sets the initial value:**  The parent component passes its `inputValue` to the child component's `value` prop.

2.  **Listens for the `input` event (in the case of `<input>`) or `change` event (in the case of `<select>`, `<textarea>`, etc.):** When the value of the input field changes, the child component emits an `input` (or `change`) event.

3.  **Updates the parent component's variable:** Svelte uses this event to update the parent component's `inputValue` variable.

**Custom Events and Two-Way Binding:**

For more complex components where the standard HTML events (like `input` or `change`) aren't sufficient, you can create your own custom events and use them for two-way binding.  To do this, you'll need to dispatch a custom event with the updated value.  Let's see an example:

**Parent Component (App.svelte):**

```svelte
<script>
  import CustomInput from './CustomInput.svelte';

  let customValue = 'Initial Value';

  function handleValueChange(event) {
    customValue = event.detail; // Extract the new value from the event detail
  }
</script>

<CustomInput value={customValue} on:valueChange={handleValueChange} />

<p>Value in App.svelte: {customValue}</p>
```

**Child Component (CustomInput.svelte):**

```svelte
<script>
  import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';

  export let value = '';

  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

  function handleInputChange(event) {
    value = event.target.value; // Update the internal value
    dispatch('valueChange', value); // Dispatch the custom event with the new value
  }
</script>

<input type="text" value={value} on:input={handleInputChange} />
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`createEventDispatcher`:** This function from `svelte` allows you to create a dispatcher for custom events.
*   **`dispatch('valueChange', value)`:** This line dispatches a custom event named `valueChange`. The second argument (`value`) is the data that will be sent along with the event.  It's typically accessed in the parent component via `event.detail`.
*   **`on:valueChange={handleValueChange}`:** In the parent component, you listen for the `valueChange` event and call the `handleValueChange` function.  This function extracts the new value from `event.detail` and updates the parent component's state.
*   **Removing `bind:value` from the parent component.** When using custom events, the `bind:` directive is no longer needed in the parent. Instead you are now listening for `valueChange` prop being called from the child.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

*   **Forgetting `export let`:** This is the most common cause of the "Can't bind to component prop" error.  Double-check that you've correctly declared the prop using `export let`.

*   **Trying to bind to a read-only prop:** If you only need to pass data down from the parent to the child, and you don't want the child to modify the parent's state, you can use a regular `let` declaration or even `const`.  However, in this case, you *cannot* use two-way binding.

*   **Incorrect event handling:**  When using custom events for two-way binding, make sure you're dispatching the correct event and that the parent component is listening for the correct event name and extracting the data from `event.detail`.

*   **Binding to the correct property:** Ensure you're binding to the correct property of the HTML element.  For example, for `<input type="text">`, you bind to `value`. For `<select>`, you also bind to `value`. For `<input type="checkbox">`, you bind to `checked`.

## Conclusion

Understanding how `export let` works is crucial for effectively using component props and two-way binding in Svelte. By correctly declaring your props, you can avoid the "Can't bind to component prop" error and build interactive and maintainable Svelte applications. Remember to choose between automatic binding via `bind:` and custom events based on the complexity and needs of your component. Happy coding!
