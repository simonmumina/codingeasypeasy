# How to Clear Windows Store Cache: Fix App Issues with wsreset.exe

The Windows Store (now officially known as the Microsoft Store) is your gateway to a plethora of apps, games, and utilities for your Windows 10 or Windows 11 PC.  However, like any software, it can sometimes encounter issues.  Download errors, slow performance, apps failing to launch, or generally buggy behavior can often be traced back to a corrupted or overloaded cache.  Fortunately, clearing the Windows Store cache is a simple process that can often resolve these problems. This guide will walk you through the steps of using `wsreset.exe`, a built-in command-line tool, to clear the Windows Store cache and get your apps running smoothly again.

## Why Clear the Windows Store Cache?

Think of the Windows Store cache as a temporary storage space for files and data needed to run the Store and your downloaded apps.  Over time, this cache can become bloated, corrupted, or contain outdated information.  Clearing the cache helps in the following ways:

*   **Fixing Download and Installation Errors:** Resolves issues preventing you from downloading or installing new apps or updates.
*   **Improving App Performance:**  A clean cache can lead to faster app launch times and smoother operation.
*   **Resolving Launch Problems:**  Addresses situations where apps fail to launch or crash upon opening.
*   **Fixing Error Codes:**  Often, clearing the cache can resolve various error codes you might encounter within the Microsoft Store.
*   **Ensuring the Store is up-to-date:** Removes potentially conflicting outdated temporary files

## Method 1: Using wsreset.exe via Command Prompt

The most common and easiest way to clear the Windows Store cache is by using the `wsreset.exe` command. Here's how:

1.  **Open the Command Prompt as Administrator:**

    *   Press the Windows key, type "cmd," and right-click on "Command Prompt" in the search results.
    *   Select "Run as administrator."  This is crucial, as `wsreset.exe` requires administrator privileges to function correctly.

2.  **Type `wsreset.exe` and Press Enter:**

    In the Command Prompt window, type `wsreset.exe` (without quotes) and press Enter.

    ```bash
    wsreset.exe
    ```

    ![Command Prompt wsreset.exe](image-placeholder-wsreset-command.png) *(Replace with an actual screenshot of the command)*

3.  **Wait for the Process to Complete:**

    A blank Command Prompt window will appear. This is normal.  Do **not** close it. `wsreset.exe` is working behind the scenes to clear the cache.  The process usually takes a few seconds to a minute. Once complete, the Command Prompt window will automatically close, and the Microsoft Store app will open.  This indicates that the cache has been successfully cleared.

4.  **Restart Your Computer (Recommended):**

    Although not always necessary, restarting your computer after clearing the cache can help ensure that the changes take effect fully and resolve any lingering issues.

## Method 2: Using wsreset.exe via PowerShell

While the Command Prompt is more commonly used, you can also use PowerShell to run `wsreset.exe`. The steps are very similar:

1.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**

    *   Press the Windows key, type "powershell," and right-click on "Windows PowerShell" in the search results.
    *   Select "Run as administrator."

    ![PowerShell Run as Administrator](image-placeholder-powershell-admin.png)  *(Replace with an actual screenshot of running PowerShell as administrator)*

2.  **Type `wsreset.exe` and Press Enter:**

    In the PowerShell window, type `wsreset.exe` (without quotes) and press Enter.

    ```powershell
    wsreset.exe
    ```

    ![PowerShell wsreset.exe](image-placeholder-wsreset-powershell.png) *(Replace with an actual screenshot of the command)*

3.  **Wait for the Process to Complete:**

    Just like with the Command Prompt, a blank PowerShell window will appear. Wait for it to close automatically and for the Microsoft Store to open.

4.  **Restart Your Computer (Recommended):**

    As before, restarting your computer is recommended for optimal results.

## Troubleshooting Tips

*   **Ensure Administrator Privileges:** `wsreset.exe` *must* be run with administrator privileges.  If you don't run it as administrator, it will likely fail silently or return an error.
*   **Check for Disk Errors:** Run `chkdsk` (Check Disk) to ensure there are no file system errors on your hard drive.  Corrupted files can sometimes contribute to cache issues. Open Command Prompt as Admin and run:

    ```bash
    chkdsk /f /r
    ```

    You'll likely be prompted to schedule the disk check for the next restart.  Type `Y` and press Enter, then restart your computer.  *Note: This process can take a long time depending on the size of your hard drive and the number of errors.*

*   **Check Your Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is required for the Microsoft Store to function correctly.  Ensure you have a working internet connection before clearing the cache.
*   **Disable Proxy Servers:** If you are using a proxy server, try disabling it temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.  Go to *Settings > Network & Internet > Proxy* and disable the proxy settings.
*   **Update Windows:** Make sure your Windows installation is up-to-date with the latest updates.  Microsoft often releases updates that address known issues with the Store.
*   **Try the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter:** Windows has a built-in troubleshooter for Store apps.  To run it:

    *   Go to *Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters*.
    *   Select "Windows Store Apps" and click "Run the troubleshooter."

*   **Re-register the Microsoft Store:** In some cases, the Microsoft Store itself might be corrupted. You can try re-registering it using PowerShell:

    1.  Open PowerShell as Administrator.
    2.  Run the following command (copy and paste it to avoid errors):

        ```powershell
        Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
        ```

    3.  Press Enter.  This command will re-register the Microsoft Store app. Ignore any red error messages that might appear.
    4.  Restart your computer.
