# React Native PDF Renderer: Display PDFs Effortlessly on iOS and Android

Displaying PDF documents within a React Native application can seem daunting, but with the `react-native-pdf-renderer` library, it becomes a surprisingly straightforward process. This blog post will guide you through everything you need to know to integrate PDF rendering into your iOS and Android apps using `react-native-pdf-renderer`. We'll cover setup, rendering from different sources, handling errors, and optimizing performance.

## Why Use `react-native-pdf-renderer`?

`react-native-pdf-renderer` is a powerful and flexible library that simplifies the process of displaying PDF documents in your React Native applications. Here's why it's a great choice:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
- **Multiple Source Options:** Supports rendering PDFs from local files, remote URLs, and base64 encoded data.
- **Customization:** Offers a wide range of customizable properties to control the appearance and behavior of the PDF viewer.
- **Ease of Use:** Provides a simple and intuitive API, making integration quick and easy.
- **Performance:** Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth rendering even with large PDF documents.

## Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Before we dive into the code, let's install the necessary dependencies. Open your React Native project and run the following command:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-pdf-renderer
# or
yarn add react-native-pdf-renderer
```

After installing the package, you'll need to link the native modules. In most cases, this will happen automatically. However, if you encounter any issues, you can try manually linking the modules using:

```plaintext
npx react-native link react-native-pdf-renderer
```

For iOS, you may also need to navigate to your `ios` directory in the terminal and run:

```plaintext
pod install
```

**Important Considerations for iOS:**

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the PDF files. If you are loading a PDF from a remote URL, you will need to allow arbitrary loads in your `Info.plist` file. Add the following code snippet to your `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

**Note:** Enabling `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` should be done with caution and is generally not recommended for production environments due to security concerns. Consider implementing more specific exceptions for whitelisted domains in a real-world application.

## Rendering PDFs: From Various Sources

Now that we have the library installed and linked, let's explore how to render PDFs from different sources.

### 1. Rendering from a Local File

To render a PDF from a local file stored within your React Native project, you'll need to place the PDF file in a suitable directory (e.g., the `assets` folder).

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native'
import Pdf from 'react-native-pdf-renderer'

const LocalPDFExample = () => {
  const source = { uri: 'bundle-assets://sample.pdf', cache: true } // Replace 'sample.pdf' with your file name

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Pdf source={source} style={styles.pdf} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
  },
})

export default LocalPDFExample
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `Pdf` component from `react-native-pdf-renderer`.
- The `source` prop is an object that specifies the location of the PDF file. `bundle-assets://sample.pdf` indicates the PDF is bundled with your app. Replace `'sample.pdf'` with the actual filename. `cache: true` enables caching for improved performance.
- We use `Dimensions.get('window')` to make the PDF fill the screen, but you can adjust the width and height as needed.

**Important:** Ensure you have added the PDF file to your project's bundle. The process for adding assets varies slightly depending on your project setup and build tool (e.g., Metro). Refer to the React Native documentation for details on managing assets.

### 2. Rendering from a Remote URL

Displaying a PDF from a remote URL is a common use case. Here's how you can achieve it:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native'
import Pdf from 'react-native-pdf-renderer'

const RemotePDFExample = () => {
  const source = { uri: 'https://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf', cache: true } // Replace with your URL

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Pdf source={source} style={styles.pdf} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
  },
})

export default RemotePDFExample
```

**Explanation:**

- The `source` prop now points to a remote URL containing the PDF file. Replace `'https://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf'` with the actual URL of your PDF.

### 3. Rendering from Base64 Encoded Data

You can also render a PDF from Base64 encoded data. This is useful when you receive the PDF content as a string from an API or other source.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions, Text } from 'react-native'
import Pdf from 'react-native-pdf-renderer'

const Base64PDFExample = () => {
  const [base64Source, setBase64Source] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate fetching Base64 data from an API
    const fetchBase64Data = async () => {
      // Replace with your actual API call or data source
      const sampleBase64 = 'YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PDF_DATA_HERE' // Replace this placeholder
      setBase64Source(sampleBase64)
    }

    fetchBase64Data()
  }, [])

  if (!base64Source) {
    return <Text>Loading Base64 Data...</Text>
  }

  const source = { uri: `data:application/pdf;base64,${base64Source}`, cache: true }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Pdf source={source} style={styles.pdf} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
  },
})

export default Base64PDFExample
```

**Explanation:**

- We use the `data:` URI scheme to specify the Base64 encoded PDF data. The format is `data:application/pdf;base64,<base64_data>`.
- Replace `'YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_PDF_DATA_HERE'` with your actual Base64 encoded string.
- The example includes a state variable `base64Source` and a `useEffect` hook to simulate fetching the data. In a real application, you would replace the placeholder with your API call.

**Note:** Handling large Base64 encoded strings can impact performance. Consider alternative methods if possible, such as streaming the PDF data directly.

## Handling Errors and Loading States

It's essential to handle potential errors and display a loading indicator while the PDF is being loaded. `react-native-pdf-renderer` provides callbacks to help with this.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions, ActivityIndicator, Text } from 'react-native'
import Pdf from 'react-native-pdf-renderer'

const ErrorHandlingExample = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)

  const source = { uri: 'https://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf', cache: true }

  const onLoadComplete = (numberOfPages, filePath) => {
    console.log(`Number of pages: ${numberOfPages}`)
    setIsLoading(false)
    setError(null) // Reset error on successful load
  }

  const onLoadError = (error) => {
    console.log('Error loading PDF:', error)
    setIsLoading(false)
    setError('Failed to load PDF. Please check your connection or try again later.')
  }

  const onPageChanged = (page, numberOfPages) => {
    console.log(`Current page: ${page}`)
  }

  const onLinkPressed = (uri) => {
    console.log(`Link pressed: ${uri}`)
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {isLoading && (
        <View style={styles.loadingContainer}>
          <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#0000ff" />
          <Text>Loading PDF...</Text>
        </View>
      )}

      {error && (
        <View style={styles.errorContainer}>
          <Text style={styles.errorText}>{error}</Text>
        </View>
      )}

      {!isLoading && !error && (
        <Pdf
          source={source}
          style={styles.pdf}
          onLoadComplete={onLoadComplete}
          onLoadError={onLoadError}
          onPageChanged={onPageChanged}
          onLinkPressed={onLinkPressed}
        />
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
  },
  loadingContainer: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)', // Semi-transparent background
  },
  errorContainer: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1)', // Light red background
  },
  errorText: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: 'red',
    textAlign: 'center',
    padding: 10,
  },
})

export default ErrorHandlingExample
```

**Explanation:**

- We use the `isLoading` state variable to track whether the PDF is currently loading.
- `ActivityIndicator` displays a loading spinner while `isLoading` is true.
- The `onLoadComplete` callback is called when the PDF has finished loading successfully. We update `isLoading` to `false`.
- The `onLoadError` callback is called if there's an error loading the PDF. We update `isLoading` to `false` and set an `error` message to display to the user.
- We conditionally render the `Pdf` component only when `isLoading` is false and there is no `error`. Otherwise, we show the loading indicator or the error message.

## Customization Options

`react-native-pdf-renderer` offers a range of customizable options to tailor the PDF viewer to your specific needs. Here are some of the key properties:

- **`style`:** Allows you to apply custom styles to the PDF viewer container.
- **`source`:** (As seen above) Specifies the source of the PDF (local file, URL, or Base64 data).
- **`scale`:** Controls the zoom level of the PDF.
- **`minScale` and `maxScale`:** Set the minimum and maximum zoom levels.
- **`horizontal`:** Enables horizontal scrolling instead of vertical scrolling.
- **`enablePaging`:** Enables paging mode, displaying one page at a time.
- **`password`:** If the PDF is password-protected, you can provide the password here.
- **`onLoadComplete`:** Called when the PDF has finished loading.
- **`onLoadError`:** Called if there is an error loading the PDF.
- **`onPageChanged`:** Called when the user navigates to a different page.
- **`onLinkPressed`:** Called when a link in the PDF is pressed.
- **`trustAllCerts`:** (Android only) If set to true, all SSL certificates will be trusted, even self-signed ones. Use with caution in production environments.

## Optimizing Performance

Rendering large PDF documents can be resource-intensive. Here are some tips to optimize performance:

- **Caching:** Use the `cache: true` option in the `source` prop to enable caching of remote PDFs.
- **Downsampling:** If possible, provide PDF documents that are already optimized for mobile viewing (e.g., lower resolution images).
- **Pagination:** Enable paging mode (`enablePaging={true}`) to display only one page at a time, reducing the initial rendering load.
- **Limit Zoom:** Set appropriate `minScale` and `maxScale` values to prevent excessive zooming, which can strain performance.
- **Lazy Loading (Advanced):** Implement a more advanced lazy loading strategy where you only load the pages that are currently visible on the screen. This would require custom logic and may not be necessary for most use cases.

## Conclusion

`react-native-pdf-renderer` is a versatile and efficient library for displaying PDF documents in your React Native applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly integrate PDF rendering into your iOS and Android apps, providing a rich and engaging user experience.
