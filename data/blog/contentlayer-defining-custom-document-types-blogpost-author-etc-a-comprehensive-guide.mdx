# Contentlayer: Defining Custom Document Types (BlogPost, Author, etc.) - A Comprehensive Guide

Contentlayer is a powerful content management system (CMS) for Next.js that allows you to treat your content as data. It provides a structured way to manage MDX and other file-based content, making it easier to query, transform, and display your content in a consistent and organized manner. One of the key features of Contentlayer is its ability to define **custom document types**. This allows you to create specific schemas for different types of content, such as blog posts, authors, pages, or any other type of data you want to manage.

In this comprehensive guide, we will explore how to define custom document types in Contentlayer, using `BlogPost` and `Author` as examples. We'll cover the basic concepts, provide detailed code examples, and discuss best practices for creating a robust content architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Node.js (v16 or higher):** Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.
- **Next.js project:** You should have an existing Next.js project or be able to create one.
- **Contentlayer installed:** If you don't have Contentlayer installed already, you can add it to your project:

  ```plaintext
  npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer
  # or
  yarn add contentlayer next-contentlayer
  # or
  pnpm add contentlayer next-contentlayer
  ```

- **Basic understanding of TypeScript and MDX:** Familiarity with TypeScript and Markdown syntax will be helpful.

## Setting Up Contentlayer Configuration

First, you need to configure Contentlayer. Create a `contentlayer.config.ts` (or `.js` if you're not using TypeScript) file at the root of your project. This file is where you define your document types and other Contentlayer configurations.

```plaintext
// contentlayer.config.ts
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'

const BlogPost = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'BlogPost',
  filePathPattern: `blog/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: 'mdx',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    date: { type: 'date', required: true },
    lastmod: { type: 'date' },
    summary: { type: 'string', required: true },
    tags: { type: 'list', of: { type: 'string' } },
    draft: { type: 'boolean', default: false },
    author: { type: 'string', required: true },
    image: { type: 'string' }, // URL to the blog post image
  },
  computedFields: {
    url: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (doc) => `/blog/${doc._raw.flattenedPath}`,
    },
  },
}))

const Author = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Author',
  filePathPattern: `authors/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: 'mdx',
  fields: {
    name: { type: 'string', required: true },
    avatar: { type: 'string', required: true },
    title: { type: 'string' },
    twitter: { type: 'string' },
    linkedin: { type: 'string' },
    github: { type: 'string' },
    email: { type: 'string' },
  },
  computedFields: {
    slug: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.sourceFileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, ''),
    },
  },
}))

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: 'content',
  documentTypes: [BlogPost, Author],
})
```

Let's break down this configuration:

- **`defineDocumentType`**: This function is the core of defining a custom document type. It accepts a function that returns an object defining the schema for that document type.

- **`name`**: A unique name for your document type (e.g., `'BlogPost'`, `'Author'`). This is the name you'll use to refer to this document type in your code.

- **`filePathPattern`**: A glob pattern that specifies which files Contentlayer should process as this document type. `blog/**/*.mdx` means that all MDX files inside the `content/blog` directory (and its subdirectories) will be treated as `BlogPost` documents. `authors/**/*.mdx` means that all MDX files inside the `content/authors` directory (and its subdirectories) will be treated as `Author` documents.

- **`contentType`**: Specifies the content type of the files. Currently, Contentlayer primarily supports `'mdx'`.

- **`fields`**: This is the most important part. It defines the schema for your document type. Each field specifies:

  - **`type`**: The data type of the field (e.g., `'string'`, `'date'`, `'list'`, `'boolean'`).
  - **`required`**: Whether the field is required. If `true`, Contentlayer will throw an error if the field is missing in your MDX frontmatter.
  - **`default`**: An optional default value for the field if it's not present in the frontmatter.
  - **`of`**: (For `list` types) Specifies the type of the elements in the list. For example, `{ type: 'list', of: { type: 'string' } }` defines a list of strings.

- **`computedFields`**: This lets you define fields that are automatically calculated based on the content of the document. This is useful for things like generating URLs or slugs. The `resolve` function receives the document object as input and returns the computed value.

- **`makeSource`**: This function combines all your document type definitions and configuration into a single source of truth for Contentlayer.
  - **`contentDirPath`**: The directory where your content files are located (e.g., `'content'`).
  - **`documentTypes`**: An array of the document types you've defined.

## Creating Content Files

Now that you have defined your document types, you can create the corresponding content files.

Create the following directories and files within your `content` directory:

```
content/
├── blog/
│   ├── first-blog-post.mdx
│   └── second-blog-post.mdx
└── authors/
    ├── john-doe.mdx
    └── jane-smith.mdx
```

Here are example content files:

**content/blog/first-blog-post.mdx:**

```mdx
---
title: 'My First Blog Post with Contentlayer'
date: '2024-10-27'
lastmod: '2024-10-27'
summary: 'This is my first blog post using Contentlayer to manage content in Next.js.'
tags: ['contentlayer', 'nextjs', 'mdx']
draft: false
author: 'john-doe'
image: '/images/blog-post-1.jpg'
---

# Welcome to my first blog post!

This is the main content of my blog post, written in MDX. You can use Markdown syntax, React components, and more!

Here's an example of a React component:

<MyComponent />
```

**content/blog/second-blog-post.mdx:**

## Using Contentlayer Data in Your Next.js Components

Now you can access the data generated by Contentlayer in your Next.js components.

First, import the generated types and data from the `.contentlayer/generated` directory. This directory is created by Contentlayer during the build process.

Create a `BlogList.tsx` component to display the blog posts:

```plaintext jsx
// components/BlogList.tsx
import { allBlogPosts, BlogPost } from '.contentlayer/generated';
import Link from 'next/link';

interface BlogListProps {
  posts: BlogPost[];
}

const BlogList: React.FC<BlogListProps> = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post._id}>
          <Link href={post.url}>
            <a>
              <h3>{post.title}</h3>
              <p>{post.summary}</p>
            </a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default BlogList;
```

Create a `AuthorList.tsx` component to display the authors:

```plaintext jsx
// components/AuthorList.tsx
import { allAuthors, Author } from '.contentlayer/generated';
import Link from 'next/link';

interface AuthorListProps {
  authors: Author[];
}

const AuthorList: React.FC<AuthorListProps> = ({ authors }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {authors.map((author) => (
        <li key={author._id}>
          <Link href={`/authors/${author.slug}`}>
            <a>
              <h3>{author.name}</h3>
              <img src={author.avatar} alt={author.name} width={50} height={50} />
              <p>{author.title}</p>
            </a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default AuthorList;
```

Now, use these components in your `pages/index.tsx`:

```plaintext jsx
// pages/index.tsx
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next';
import BlogList from '../components/BlogList';
import AuthorList from '../components/AuthorList';
import { allBlogPosts, allAuthors } from '.contentlayer/generated';

interface Props {
  posts: typeof allBlogPosts;
  authors: typeof allAuthors;
}

const IndexPage: React.FC<Props> = ({ posts, authors }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      <BlogList posts={posts} />

      <h1>Authors</h1>
      <AuthorList authors={authors} />
    </div>
  );
};

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const posts = allBlogPosts;
  const authors = allAuthors;

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
      authors,
    },
  };
};

export default IndexPage;
```

In this example:

- We import `allBlogPosts` and `allAuthors` from `.contentlayer/generated`. These variables contain all the data extracted from your MDX files, typed according to your `BlogPost` and `Author` document types.
- We pass the `posts` and `authors` data to the `BlogList` and `AuthorList` components, respectively.
- `getStaticProps` fetches the data at build time, ensuring that your pages are pre-rendered with the latest content.

## Adding Dynamic Routes for Authors

To create dynamic routes for each author (e.g., `/authors/john-doe`), you can use Next.js's dynamic routing feature and Contentlayer's generated data.

1.  **Create a `pages/authors/[slug].tsx` file:**

```plaintext jsx
// pages/authors/[slug].tsx
import { GetStaticProps, GetStaticPaths } from 'next';
import { allAuthors, Author } from '.contentlayer/generated';
import { useMDXComponent } from 'next-contentlayer';
import  { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

interface AuthorPageProps {
  author: Author;
  mdxSource: any;
}

const AuthorPage: React.FC<AuthorPageProps> = ({ author, mdxSource }) => {
  const MDXContent = useMDXComponent(mdxSource.body);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{author.name}</h1>
      <img src={author.avatar} alt={author.name} width={100} height={100} />
      <p>{author.title}</p>
      <MDXContent />
    </div>
  );
};

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  const paths = allAuthors.map((author) => ({ params: { slug: author.slug } }));
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false, // Or 'blocking' if you want to wait for content to load
  };
};

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const slug = params?.slug as string;
  const author = allAuthors.find((author) => author.slug === slug);

  if (!author) {
    return {
      notFound: true,
    };
  }
  const mdxSource = await serialize(author.body.raw)


  return {
    props: {
      author,
      mdxSource,
    },
  };
};

export default AuthorPage;
```

In this code:

- **`getStaticPaths`**: Generates all possible paths for the `[slug]` route based on the `slug` computed field of each author.
- **`getStaticProps`**: Fetches the specific author data based on the `slug` parameter. It also extracts and serializes the MDX content of the author's file using `next-mdx-remote`.
- We use `useMDXComponent` to render the MDX content within the component. You need to pass the `mdxSource` to this component.
- Make sure to install next-mdx-remote

```plaintext
npm install next-mdx-remote
```

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Content Directory Structure:** Organize your content directory logically. Consider grouping content by type (e.g., `blog`, `authors`, `pages`) or by category.

- **Data Validation:** Use TypeScript types and required fields in your document type definitions to enforce data integrity. This will help you catch errors early and ensure that your content is consistent.

- **Computed Fields:** Use computed fields to derive values that are based on other fields or file metadata. This can simplify your component logic and reduce duplication.

- **MDX Components:** Leverage MDX components to create reusable UI elements within your content. This allows you to build a consistent and dynamic content experience.

- **SEO Optimization:** Pay attention to SEO best practices when defining your document types. Include fields like `title`, `summary`, `tags`, and `date` to provide metadata for search engines. Utilize the computed fields for generating SEO-friendly URLs.

- **Image Optimization:** Optimize your images for web performance. Consider using a service like Cloudinary or Next.js's built-in image optimization features.

- **Preview Mode:** Implement preview mode to allow content editors to preview their changes before publishing them. Contentlayer's documentation provides guidance on how to set up preview mode.

## Conclusion

Defining custom document types in Contentlayer is essential for creating a structured and manageable content architecture in your Next.js projects. By defining schemas for your different types of content, you can ensure data integrity, improve code maintainability, and build a more robust and scalable content management system. This guide provides a foundation for defining custom document types, managing content files, and using Contentlayer data in your components. Experiment with different document types, fields, and computed fields to tailor Contentlayer to your specific needs and build a powerful content-driven website. Remember to adapt these examples to your specific use case and directory structure. Also, make sure you've updated your next.config.js to include the `next-contentlayer` plugin. By carefully planning your content structure and utilizing Contentlayer's features, you can streamline your content creation process and deliver a better user experience.
