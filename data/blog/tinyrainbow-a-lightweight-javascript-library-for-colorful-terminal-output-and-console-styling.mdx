## Installation

Installing TinyRainbow is a breeze using npm or yarn:

**Using npm:**

```

**Using yarn:**

```plaintext
yarn add tinyrainbow
```

## Basic Usage

Once installed, you can import TinyRainbow into your JavaScript code and start adding colors and styles to your console output.

```plaintext
// Import the TinyRainbow library
import tinyrainbow from 'tinyrainbow'

// Print a message in green
console.log(tinyrainbow.green('Hello, world!'))

// Print a message in blue and bold
console.log(tinyrainbow.blue.bold('This is important information.'))

// Print a message with a yellow background
console.log(tinyrainbow.bgYellow('Warning!'))

// Chain styles together
console.log(tinyrainbow.red.bold.underline('Error: Something went wrong.'))

// Combining colors and styles
console.log(`This is ${tinyrainbow.green.bold('important')} text.`)

// Reset the color back to default after certain string
console.log(
  `This is a ${tinyrainbow.green('green')} message and then a ${tinyrainbow.reset('normal')} message.`
)
```

## Available Colors

TinyRainbow provides a variety of colors that you can use to style your terminal output:

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `magenta`
- `cyan`
- `white`
- `gray`
- `grey` (alias for `gray`)
- `blackBright`
- `redBright`
- `greenBright`
- `yellowBright`
- `blueBright`
- `magentaBright`
- `cyanBright`
- `whiteBright`

- `italic`
- `underline`
- `inverse`
- `hidden`
- `strikethrough`
- `visible`
- `reset`

## Background Colors

TinyRainbow also includes background colors:

- `bgBlack`
- `bgRed`
- `bgGreen`
- `bgYellow`
- `bgBlue`
- `bgMagenta`
- `bgCyan`
- `bgWhite`
- `bgBlackBright`
- `bgRedBright`
- `bgGreenBright`
- `bgYellowBright`
- `bgBlueBright`
- `bgMagentaBright`

## Advanced Usage and Examples

Let's explore some more advanced use cases of TinyRainbow:

**1. Styling Error Messages:**

```plaintext
import tinyrainbow from 'tinyrainbow'

function handleError(errorMessage) {
  console.error(tinyrainbow.red.bold('ERROR:') + ' ' + tinyrainbow.red(errorMessage))
}

handleError('Failed to connect to the server.')
```

This will output:

```
ERROR: Failed to connect to the server.
```

The `ERROR:` text will be bold and red, while the error message will be red.

**2. Creating a Custom Logger:**

```plaintext
import tinyrainbow from 'tinyrainbow'

const logger = {
  info: (message) => console.log(tinyrainbow.blue('[INFO]') + ' ' + message),
  warn: (message) => console.warn(tinyrainbow.yellow('[WARN]') + ' ' + message),
  error: (message) => console.error(tinyrainbow.red.bold('[ERROR]') + ' ' + message),
  success: (message) => console.log(tinyrainbow.green('[SUCCESS]') + ' ' + message),
}

logger.info('Application started successfully.')
logger.warn('Configuration file not found.')
logger.error('An unexpected error occurred.')
logger.success('Data saved successfully.')
```

This example creates a custom logger with different colors for different log levels.

**3. Using Template Literals for Dynamic Styling:**

```plaintext
import tinyrainbow from 'tinyrainbow'

const userName = 'Alice'
const score = 95

console.log(
  `Congratulations, ${tinyrainbow.green.bold(userName)}! Your score is ${tinyrainbow.yellow(score)}.`
)
```

This allows you to dynamically style parts of your strings based on variables.

**4. Conditional Styling:**

```plaintext
import tinyrainbow from 'tinyrainbow'

function printStatus(status) {
  if (status === 'success') {
    console.log(tinyrainbow.green.bold('Status: Success'))
  } else if (status === 'failed') {
    console.log(tinyrainbow.red.bold('Status: Failed'))
  } else {
    console.log(tinyrainbow.yellow.bold('Status: Pending'))
  }
}

printStatus('success')
printStatus('failed')
printStatus('pending')
```

This example demonstrates how to conditionally apply styles based on a variable's value.

## Comparison with Other Libraries

While other libraries like `chalk` provide similar functionality, TinyRainbow often offers a more lightweight alternative with a smaller bundle size. It focuses on providing essential terminal styling features without unnecessary bloat. Consider TinyRainbow when bundle size is a crucial factor for your project.

## Considerations and Best Practices

- **Accessibility:** Be mindful of users with visual impairments. Avoid relying solely on color to convey information. Use other cues, such as text labels or icons, to ensure accessibility.
- **Consistency:** Establish a consistent color scheme for your application to improve readability and user experience.
- **Overuse:** Avoid overusing colors and styles, as this can make your output cluttered and difficult to read. Use them sparingly to highlight important information.
- **Terminal Compatibility:** While TinyRainbow aims for broad compatibility, some terminal emulators might not support all colors and styles. Test your application on different terminals to ensure it looks as expected.
- **Resetting Styles:** Use the `reset` method to revert back to the terminal's default styling after applying colors and styles. This helps prevent styles from bleeding into subsequent console logs.

## Conclusion

TinyRainbow is a valuable tool for any JavaScript developer looking to enhance their terminal output. Its lightweight nature, simple API, and wide range of colors and styles make it a perfect choice for adding visual appeal and improving the readability of your console logs and CLI applications. So, give TinyRainbow a try and start adding some color to your terminal today!
