# Node.js Automatic Server Restart with Nodemon: A Comprehensive Guide

Developing Node.js applications often involves making frequent changes to your code. Manually restarting the server every time you modify a file can be tedious and time-consuming. That's where Nodemon comes to the rescue! Nodemon is a utility that monitors for any changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server, streamlining your development workflow and saving you precious time.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about using Nodemon, from installation and basic usage to advanced configuration and customization. We'll explore how Nodemon can significantly improve your Node.js development experience.

## What is Nodemon?

Nodemon (Node Monitor) is a command-line utility that detects file changes in a specified directory and automatically restarts your Node.js application. It eliminates the need to manually stop and start your server every time you modify your code, making the development process more efficient and enjoyable. Nodemon monitors your files for changes and, upon detecting a modification, restarts the Node.js process.

## Why Use Nodemon?

- **Improved Development Workflow:** Automatic server restarts reduce the friction in your development cycle. You can focus on coding without interruption.
- **Time Savings:** Eliminates the repetitive task of manually restarting the server, saving you valuable time, especially when making frequent changes.
- **Faster Feedback Loop:** See the effects of your code changes almost immediately after saving the file.
- **Reduced Tedium:** Automates a repetitive task, making development less monotonous.
- **Increased Productivity:** By reducing downtime and eliminating manual tasks, Nodemon can boost your overall productivity.

## Installation

Installing Nodemon is straightforward using npm (Node Package Manager). You can install it globally or locally within your project.

### Global Installation (Recommended for general use):

This allows you to use Nodemon in any Node.js project on your machine.

```plaintext
npm install -g nodemon
```

Verify the installation by checking the installed version:

```plaintext
nodemon -v
```

### Local Installation (Project-Specific):

This installs Nodemon as a development dependency within your specific project. This is useful when you want to manage dependencies on a per-project basis.

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

To run Nodemon locally, you will need to use `npm run` scripts within your `package.json` file. See the Usage section below for an example.

## Usage

Once installed, using Nodemon is simple. Let's assume you have a basic Node.js application in a file named `app.js`:

```javascript
// app.js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

### Running Nodemon from the Command Line (Global Installation):

Navigate to the directory containing your `app.js` file in your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
nodemon app.js
```

Nodemon will now start your application and monitor for changes. Whenever you modify and save `app.js` (or any other file in the directory), Nodemon will automatically restart the server.

### Running Nodemon using npm scripts (Local Installation):

If you installed Nodemon locally, you'll need to define an npm script in your `package.json` file.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js" // Add this line
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1" // Make sure this matches your installed version
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1" // Example dependency
  }
}
```

Now, you can start Nodemon using the following command:

```plaintext
npm run dev
```

This executes the `dev` script defined in your `package.json` file, which in turn runs `nodemon app.js`.

## Configuration

Nodemon offers a variety of configuration options to customize its behavior. You can configure Nodemon using:

- **Command-Line Arguments:** Passing options directly in the command line.
- **`nodemon.json` File:** Creating a configuration file in your project's root directory.
- **`package.json` File:** Adding configuration options within the `nodemonConfig` property in your `package.json` file.

The `nodemon.json` file is generally the preferred method for more complex configurations as it keeps your command line cleaner.

### Key Configuration Options:

- **`watch`:** Specifies the files or directories to monitor for changes.
- **`ignore`:** Excludes specific files or directories from being monitored. Useful for excluding things like node_modules.
- **`ext`:** Defines the file extensions to watch for changes (e.g., js, mjs, json).
- **`exec`:** Specifies the command to execute when a change is detected. By default, it runs `node`.
- **`delay`:** Sets a delay in milliseconds before restarting the server after a change is detected. This can be useful to prevent rapid restarts when multiple files are changed simultaneously.
- **`verbose`:** Enables verbose output, providing more detailed information about Nodemon's actions.
- **`legacyWatch`**: Enables the legacy watch option to poll for changes. Useful for Docker based development.
- **`signal`**: Allows you to define the signal to send to the process. Default is `SIGUSR2`.

### Examples:

**1. `nodemon.json` configuration:**

Create a file named `nodemon.json` in your project's root directory and add the following configuration:

```json
// nodemon.json
{
  "watch": ["app.js", "routes/", "config/"],
  "ignore": ["node_modules/", "data/"],
  "ext": "js,json",
  "delay": "2500",
  "exec": "node app.js"
}
```

This configuration tells Nodemon to:

- Watch `app.js`, the `routes` directory, and the `config` directory for changes.
- Ignore the `node_modules` and `data` directories.
- Watch for changes in `.js` and `.json` files.
- Wait 2.5 seconds after a change before restarting.
- Execute `node app.js` when a change is detected.

**2. `package.json` configuration:**

Add a `nodemonConfig` property to your `package.json` file:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-node-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "nodemonConfig": {
    "watch": ["app.js", "routes/", "config/"],
    "ignore": ["node_modules/", "data/"],
    "ext": "js,json"
  }
}
```

**3. Command line arguments:**

```plaintext
nodemon --watch app.js --ignore node_modules --ext js,json app.js
```

This command achieves the same configuration as the previous examples, but uses command-line arguments. Command line arguments override configurations in `nodemon.json` and `package.json` files.

## Advanced Techniques

### Ignoring Specific Files

Sometimes you might want to prevent Nodemon from restarting your server when certain files change (e.g., log files, temporary files). You can achieve this using the `ignore` option.

```json
// nodemon.json
{
  "ignore": ["node_modules/", "logs/*", "tmp/*"]
}
```

This configuration tells Nodemon to ignore any changes in the `node_modules` directory, any file inside the `logs` directory, and any file inside the `tmp` directory.

### Watching Multiple Directories

You can specify multiple directories to watch using the `watch` option.

```json
// nodemon.json
{
  "watch": ["src/", "config/", "views/"]
}
```

This configuration tells Nodemon to monitor the `src`, `config`, and `views` directories for changes.

### Using with Environment Variables

Nodemon passes environment variables to your application. You can set environment variables when starting Nodemon, or in your `.env` file and then load them into the environment using packages like `dotenv`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=development nodemon app.js
```

Or, using `dotenv` and a `.env` file:

1.  Install `dotenv`:

    ```plaintext
    npm install dotenv
    ```

2.  Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory:

    ```
    PORT=3001
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
    ```

3.  Load the environment variables in your `app.js` file:

    ```javascript
    // app.js
    require('dotenv').config()
    const express = require('express')
    const app = express()
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000 // Use the PORT environment variable

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World!')
    })

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
    })
    ```

4.  Run Nodemon:

    ```plaintext
    nodemon app.js
    ```

### Using Nodemon with Different Commands

The `exec` option allows you to specify a custom command to run when a change is detected. This is useful for running tests, linters, or other tasks before restarting the server.

**Example:**

```json
// nodemon.json
{
  "exec": "npm run lint && node app.js"
}
```

This configuration will run the `lint` script (defined in your `package.json`) before restarting the server.

### Using Nodemon with Docker

When developing within Docker containers, you may encounter issues with file system events not being properly detected by Nodemon. The `legacyWatch` option can resolve this issue. This option forces Nodemon to use polling instead of file system events, which works reliably in Docker environments.

```json
// nodemon.json
{
  "legacyWatch": true,
  "delay": "1000" // Increase the delay for better stability in Docker
}
```

Also, consider increasing the `delay` to give the container's file system time to synchronize.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nodemon is not restarting on file changes:**

  - Double-check your `watch` configuration to ensure it includes the correct files and directories.
  - Verify that the file extensions specified in the `ext` option are correct.
  - Make sure you're saving the files after making changes.
  - If using Docker, try enabling the `legacyWatch` option and increasing the `delay`.

- **Nodemon is restarting too frequently:**

  - Reduce the sensitivity by increasing the `delay` option.
  - Ensure that you're not watching files that are frequently updated (e.g., log files).

- **Nodemon is throwing an error:**

  - Check the error message in the console for clues.
  - Ensure that the `exec` command is correct and that all necessary dependencies are installed.
  - Try updating Nodemon to the latest version.

- **Nodemon is not working within a Docker environment**

  - Ensure your volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml` or `docker run` is set up correctly, so your changes in the host machine are reflected inside the container.
  - Use the `legacyWatch` option and a higher `delay` to allow for proper file system synchronization.
  - Double check if nodemon and your node app have access to the relevant filepaths.
