# React Native PDF Viewer: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

In today's mobile landscape, the ability to display PDF documents within your application is crucial for many use cases. Whether it's displaying reports, invoices, ebooks, or any other document format, users expect a seamless experience. This blog post provides a deep dive into using `react-native-pdf` â€“ a popular and versatile library for rendering PDFs in React Native applications.

## What is `react-native-pdf`?

`react-native-pdf` is a React Native component that allows you to display PDF documents within your mobile application. It supports various features like:

*   **Local and Remote PDFs:** Load PDFs from local file paths or URLs.
*   **Zooming and Panning:** Allows users to zoom in and pan around the document for better readability.
*   **Pagination:** Navigate through the PDF document page by page.
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors during PDF loading.
*   **Customization:**  Offers a range of props to customize the appearance and behavior of the viewer.

## Why Use `react-native-pdf`?

*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms.
*   **Easy Integration:** Simple and straightforward installation and usage.
*   **Highly Customizable:**  Adapt the viewer to match your application's design.
*   **Active Community:**  Benefit from a large community and regular updates.

## Installation

First, install the `react-native-pdf` package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-native-pdf --save
# or
yarn add react-native-pdf
```

After installation, you might need to link the native dependencies. For React Native versions 0.60 and above, auto-linking should handle this automatically. However, if you encounter issues, you can manually link them:

```bash
react-native link react-native-pdf
```

**Important Note:**  If you are using Expo, the `react-native-pdf` library requires you to eject to the bare workflow as it utilizes native modules.

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to display a PDF from a URL:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions } from 'react-native';
import Pdf from 'react-native-pdf';

const App = () => {
  const source = {
    uri: 'http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf',
    cache: true,
  }; // Remote PDF
  //const source = require('./test.pdf');   // Local PDF
  //const source = {uri:'bundle-assets://test.pdf'};

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Pdf
        source={source}
        style={styles.pdf}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height,
  },
});

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`import Pdf from 'react-native-pdf';`**: Imports the `Pdf` component from the library.
*   **`source` object**: Defines the source of the PDF.  In this example, it's a remote PDF. You can also use a local file path or a bundle asset.  The `cache: true` option tells the component to cache the PDF.
*   **`<Pdf>` component**: Renders the PDF document.  The `source` prop specifies the PDF source, and the `style` prop defines the styling.

## Loading Local PDFs

To load a PDF from your local file system, you can modify the `source` object. Here's an example:

```jsx
const source = require('./assets/my_document.pdf'); // Local PDF (relative path)
```

**Important:** Ensure that your PDF file is placed within your project's `assets` folder or any other location that your React Native application can access. For iOS, you might need to add the PDF to your Xcode project.

## Customizing the PDF Viewer

The `react-native-pdf` component provides various props for customizing its appearance and behavior. Here are some commonly used props:

*   **`style`**:  Applies styles to the PDF viewer container.
*   **`source`**:  Specifies the PDF source (URL, local file path, or base64 string).
*   **`scale`**:  Sets the initial zoom scale.
*   **`minScale`**:  Sets the minimum zoom scale.
*   **`maxScale`**:  Sets the maximum zoom scale.
*   **`horizontal`**: Enables horizontal scrolling (pagination). Defaults to `false` for vertical scrolling.
*   **`enablePaging`**:  Enables page-by-page navigation (only effective when `horizontal` is `true`).
*   **`fitPolicy`**: Determines how the PDF should be scaled to fit the container. Options are `'width'`, `'height'`, `'both'`.
*   **`onLoadComplete`**:  Callback function triggered when the PDF is successfully loaded.
*   **`onError`**:  Callback function triggered when an error occurs during PDF loading.
*   **`onPageChanged`**: Callback function triggered when the page changes.
*   **`onPressLink`**: Callback function triggered when a link in the PDF is pressed.

**Example with Customization:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Dimensions, Text } from 'react-native';
import Pdf from 'react-native-pdf';

const App = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
  const [pageCount, setPageCount] = useState(0);

  const source = {
    uri: 'http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf',
    cache: true,
  };

  const handleLoadComplete = (numberOfPages, filePath) => {
    console.log(`PDF loaded successfully with ${numberOfPages} pages`);
    setPageCount(numberOfPages);
  };

  const handleError = (error) => {
    console.error('Error loading PDF:', error);
  };

  const handlePageChanged = (page, numberOfPages) => {
    console.log(`Current page: ${page}`);
    setCurrentPage(page);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Pdf
        source={source}
        style={styles.pdf}
        onLoadComplete={handleLoadComplete}
        onError={handleError}
        onPageChanged={handlePageChanged}
        horizontal={true}
        enablePaging={true}
        minScale={1.0}
        maxScale={3.0}
        fitPolicy="width"
      />
      <View style={styles.pagination}>
        <Text>{currentPage} / {pageCount}</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-start',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 25,
  },
  pdf: {
    flex: 1,
    width: Dimensions.get('window').width,
    height: Dimensions.get('window').height - 50, // Adjust height for pagination
  },
  pagination: {
    position: 'absolute',
    bottom: 10,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

In this example:

*   We added state variables (`currentPage`, `pageCount`) to track the current page and the total number of pages.
*   We implemented `onLoadComplete`, `onError`, and `onPageChanged` callback functions to handle loading events and page changes.
*   We enabled horizontal paging (`horizontal={true}` and `enablePaging={true}`).
*   We set `minScale` and `maxScale` to control the zoom levels.
*   We used `fitPolicy="width"` to fit the PDF width to the container.
*   We added a simple pagination display at the bottom.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **PDF Not Loading:**  Double-check the PDF source URL or file path. Ensure that the PDF file exists and is accessible.  Verify network connectivity if you're loading a remote PDF.  Also, make sure the PDF is a valid PDF file.
*   **Blank Screen:**  This can happen if the PDF is corrupted or if the styling is incorrect.  Try setting explicit width and height values for the `pdf` style.  Also, check the console for any error messages.
*   **Scaling Issues:**  Experiment with the `minScale`, `maxScale`, and `fitPolicy` props to adjust the scaling behavior.
*   **iOS Issues with Local Files:** Make sure the PDF is included in your Xcode project's bundle resources.  Right-click on your project in Xcode -> "Add Files to [Your Project Name]" and select the PDF. Ensure "Copy items if needed" is checked.

## Best Practices

*   **Error Handling:**  Always implement error handling to gracefully handle situations where the PDF fails to load.
*   **Loading Indicators:**  Provide a loading indicator while the PDF is loading to improve the user experience.
*   **Caching:** Use the `cache: true` option to cache remote PDFs for faster loading on subsequent visits.
*   **Optimize PDF Size:**  Optimize your PDF files to reduce their size, especially for mobile devices.  Smaller PDFs load faster and consume less bandwidth.
*   **Security:**  Be mindful of PDF security, especially when handling sensitive information.  Consider using encryption or password protection if necessary.

## Advanced Usage

*   **Base64 Encoded PDFs:** You can display PDFs from base64 encoded strings.

    ```jsx
    const source = { uri: 'data:application/pdf;base64,...BASE64_ENCODED_STRING...' };
    ```

*   **Programmatic Control:**  You can use the `react-native-pdf`'s `forwardRef` to control the component programmatically.  This allows you to programmatically scroll to a specific page, zoom in/out, etc. (Refer to the library's documentation for specific methods).
