# Best Practices for Transactions in NestJS: Ensuring Data Consistency

Transactions are a cornerstone of reliable database interactions, guaranteeing the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). In NestJS, managing transactions effectively is crucial for maintaining data integrity in your applications, especially when dealing with complex operations involving multiple entities or services. This blog post delves into best practices for implementing transactions in NestJS, focusing on popular ORMs like TypeORM and Sequelize.

## Why Use Transactions?

Imagine a scenario where you need to update both a user's profile and their associated payment information. If the profile update succeeds but the payment update fails, you'll end up with inconsistent data. Transactions solve this problem by treating a series of database operations as a single, atomic unit. If any operation within the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring data remains in a consistent state.

## Choosing Your ORM: TypeORM vs. Sequelize

NestJS seamlessly integrates with various ORMs. TypeORM and Sequelize are two of the most popular choices. Both offer excellent support for transactions, but their approaches differ slightly.

- **TypeORM:** Offers a more TypeScript-centric approach, with decorators and strong typing. Provides a more direct control over database connections through `EntityManager`.

- **Sequelize:** A well-established ORM with a robust ecosystem and active community. Uses `Transaction` objects to manage database operations within a transactional context.

This guide will cover best practices using both TypeORM and Sequelize.

## Best Practices for Transactions in NestJS

Here's a breakdown of best practices for managing transactions in your NestJS applications:

### 1. Encapsulate Transactions within Services

Keep transaction logic separate from your controllers. Controllers should primarily handle request handling and validation, delegating the transactional work to dedicated services. This improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

**Example (TypeORM):**

```plaintext
// src/user/user.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { Repository, EntityManager } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';
import { Payment } from '../payment/payment.entity';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private userRepository: Repository<User>,
    @InjectRepository(Payment)
    private paymentRepository: Repository<Payment>,
  ) {}

  async updateUserAndPayment(userId: number, userData: Partial<User>, paymentData: Partial<Payment>): Promise<void> {
    await this.userRepository.manager.transaction(async (transactionalEntityManager: EntityManager) => {
      // Update user profile
      await transactionalEntityManager.update(User, userId, userData);

      // Update payment information
      const payment = await this.paymentRepository.findOneBy({userId: userId});
      if(!payment) {
        throw new Error("Payment not found");
      }
      await transactionalEntityManager.update(Payment, payment.id, paymentData);

      // Simulate an error (for demonstration purposes)
      // throw new Error("Simulated Error: Transaction will be rolled back");
    });
  }
}

```

**Example (Sequelize):**

```plaintext
// src/user/user.service.ts
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserModel } from './user.model';
import { PaymentModel } from '../payment/payment.model';
import { Sequelize } from 'sequelize-typescript';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('UserModel')
    private userModel: typeof UserModel,
    @Inject('PaymentModel')
    private paymentModel: typeof PaymentModel,
    private sequelize: Sequelize, // Inject Sequelize instance
  ) {}

  async updateUserAndPayment(userId: number, userData: Partial<UserModel>, paymentData: Partial<PaymentModel>): Promise<void> {
    const t = await this.sequelize.transaction(); // Start transaction

    try {
      // Update user profile
      await this.userModel.update(userData, { where: { id: userId }, transaction: t });

      // Update payment information
      await this.paymentModel.update(paymentData, { where: { userId: userId }, transaction: t });

      // Commit the transaction
      await t.commit();

    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback the transaction if any error occurs
      await t.rollback();
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled upstream
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **TypeORM:** We use `this.userRepository.manager.transaction()` to initiate a transaction. Inside the callback, we get a `transactionalEntityManager` which ensures all operations within the block are executed within the transaction context.
- **Sequelize:** We use `this.sequelize.transaction()` to start a new transaction. We pass the transaction object `t` to each `update` call to ensure they are part of the same atomic operation. The `t.commit()` and `t.rollback()` methods are used to commit or rollback the transaction, respectively.

### 2. Handle Errors and Rollbacks Gracefully

Always include error handling to gracefully rollback transactions if any exception occurs. Catch errors within the transaction block and execute the rollback logic. Re-throw the error to allow upstream layers (e.g., controllers, exception filters) to handle it appropriately.

**See the error handling and rollback parts within the code examples above for both TypeORM and Sequelize.**

**Key Points:**

- **`try...catch` blocks are essential:** Enclose your transactional code within `try...catch` blocks to capture any exceptions.
- **Re-throw errors:** After rolling back the transaction, re-throw the caught error. This allows the controller or a global exception filter to handle the error, log it, and return an appropriate response to the client.

### 3. Use Dependency Injection

Inject your repositories and the ORM (e.g., `EntityManager` in TypeORM, `Sequelize` in Sequelize) into your services using NestJS's dependency injection system. This promotes loose coupling, testability, and maintainability.

**See the constructor injection in the code examples above for both TypeORM and Sequelize.**

### 4. Define Transaction Isolation Levels (When Necessary)

Transaction isolation levels control the degree to which concurrent transactions are isolated from each other. Higher isolation levels provide greater data consistency but can also decrease concurrency. Common isolation levels include:

- **Read Uncommitted:** The lowest isolation level. Transactions can read uncommitted changes from other transactions.
- **Read Committed:** Transactions can only read committed changes from other transactions. Prevents "dirty reads."
- **Repeatable Read:** Transactions see a consistent snapshot of the data, even if other transactions modify it. Prevents "non-repeatable reads."
- **Serializable:** The highest isolation level. Transactions are completely isolated from each other. Prevents "phantom reads."

Choose the appropriate isolation level based on your application's specific requirements. The default isolation level is usually sufficient for most use cases.

**Example (TypeORM - setting isolation level):**

```plaintext
// src/user/user.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { Repository, EntityManager, IsolationLevel } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';
import { Payment } from '../payment/payment.entity';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private userRepository: Repository<User>,
    @InjectRepository(Payment)
    private paymentRepository: Repository<Payment>,
  ) {}

  async updateUserAndPayment(userId: number, userData: Partial<User>, paymentData: Partial<Payment>): Promise<void> {
    await this.userRepository.manager.transaction(IsolationLevel.REPEATABLE_READ, async (transactionalEntityManager: EntityManager) => {
      // Update user profile
      await transactionalEntityManager.update(User, userId, userData);

      // Update payment information
      const payment = await this.paymentRepository.findOneBy({userId: userId});
      if(!payment) {
        throw new Error("Payment not found");
      }
      await transactionalEntityManager.update(Payment, payment.id, paymentData);

      // Simulate an error (for demonstration purposes)
      // throw new Error("Simulated Error: Transaction will be rolled back");
    });
  }
}

```

**Example (Sequelize - setting isolation level):**

```plaintext
// src/user/user.service.ts
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserModel } from './user.model';
import { PaymentModel } from '../payment/payment.model';
import { Sequelize, Transaction } from 'sequelize-typescript';
import { IsolationLevel } from 'sequelize';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('UserModel')
    private userModel: typeof UserModel,
    @Inject('PaymentModel')
    private paymentModel: typeof PaymentModel,
    private sequelize: Sequelize, // Inject Sequelize instance
  ) {}

  async updateUserAndPayment(userId: number, userData: Partial<UserModel>, paymentData: Partial<PaymentModel>): Promise<void> {
    const t = await this.sequelize.transaction({
      isolationLevel: Transaction.ISOLATION_LEVELS.REPEATABLE_READ,
    }); // Start transaction with isolation level

    try {
      // Update user profile
      await this.userModel.update(userData, { where: { id: userId }, transaction: t });

      // Update payment information
      await this.paymentModel.update(paymentData, { where: { userId: userId }, transaction: t });

      // Commit the transaction
      await t.commit();

    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback the transaction if any error occurs
      await t.rollback();
      throw error; // Re-throw the error to be handled upstream
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Note:** Using higher isolation levels can impact performance. Carefully evaluate your application's needs before adjusting the isolation level.

### 5. Keep Transactions Short

Long-running transactions can hold database locks for extended periods, potentially blocking other operations and impacting performance. Keep transactions as short as possible by performing only the necessary operations within the transaction block.

### 6. Avoid Nested Transactions (Use Savepoints When Needed)

While some databases support nested transactions, they can be complex and difficult to manage. Instead of nesting transactions, consider using _savepoints_ if you need to create checkpoints within a transaction. Savepoints allow you to rollback to a specific point within a transaction without rolling back the entire transaction.

**Example (TypeORM - Using Savepoints - note: native savepoint support depends on the underlying database):**

```plaintext
// This is a conceptual example.  Native savepoint support in TypeORM varies by database.
// Check the TypeORM documentation for your specific database.
// Generally, savepoints are managed through raw queries.

// Example for demonstration purposes - might not work as-is.  Adapt to your database.
async updateUserAndPaymentWithSavepoint(userId: number, userData: Partial<User>, paymentData: Partial<Payment>): Promise<void> {
  await this.userRepository.manager.transaction(async (transactionalEntityManager: EntityManager) => {
    try {
      // Update user profile
      await transactionalEntityManager.update(User, userId, userData);

      // Create a savepoint
      await transactionalEntityManager.query("SAVEPOINT user_update");

      try {
        // Update payment information
        const payment = await this.paymentRepository.findOneBy({userId: userId});
        if(!payment) {
          throw new Error("Payment not found");
        }
        await transactionalEntityManager.update(Payment, payment.id, paymentData);
      } catch (paymentError) {
        // Rollback to savepoint if payment update fails
        await transactionalEntityManager.query("ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT user_update");
        throw paymentError; // Re-throw the error
      }

      // Release the savepoint (optional, depending on database)
      await transactionalEntityManager.query("RELEASE SAVEPOINT user_update");

    } catch (userError) {
      // Rollback the entire transaction if user update fails
      throw userError;
    }
  });
}
```

**Example (Sequelize - Using Savepoints):**

```plaintext
// src/user/user.service.ts
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserModel } from './user.model';
import { PaymentModel } from '../payment/payment.model';
import { Sequelize, Transaction } from 'sequelize-typescript';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('UserModel')
    private userModel: typeof UserModel,
    @Inject('PaymentModel')
    private paymentModel: typeof PaymentModel,
    private sequelize: Sequelize, // Inject Sequelize instance
  ) {}

  async updateUserAndPaymentWithSavepoint(userId: number, userData: Partial<UserModel>, paymentData: Partial<PaymentModel>): Promise<void> {
    const t = await this.sequelize.transaction(); // Start transaction

    try {
      // Update user profile
      await this.userModel.update(userData, { where: { id: userId }, transaction: t });

      // Create a savepoint
      await t.savepoint('user_update');

      try {
        // Update payment information
        await this.paymentModel.update(paymentData, { where: { userId: userId }, transaction: t });

        // Commit the transaction
        await t.commit();

      } catch (paymentError) {
        // Rollback to savepoint if payment update fails
        await t.rollback({ to: 'user_update' });
        throw paymentError; // Re-throw the error
      }


    } catch (userError) {
      // Rollback the entire transaction if user update fails
      await t.rollback();
      throw userError; // Re-throw the error
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We use the `t.savepoint('savepoint_name')` method to create a savepoint.
- If an error occurs during the payment update, we use `t.rollback({ to: 'savepoint_name' })` to rollback only to the savepoint, reverting the payment update but keeping the user profile update.
- If no error occurs, the transaction continues, and `t.commit()` commits all changes.
- If an error occurs before the savepoint is created, the entire transaction is rolled back by calling `t.rollback()` without any options.

### 7. Test Your Transactional Logic Thoroughly

Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify that your transactions are working correctly. Test both success and failure scenarios, ensuring that rollbacks are executed as expected.

### 8. Use Connection Pooling

Connection pooling can significantly improve the performance of your database interactions by reusing database connections instead of creating new ones for each transaction. Both TypeORM and Sequelize provide built-in support for connection pooling. Configure your ORM to use a connection pool in production. Common parameters include `max`, `min`, and `idleTimeout`.

### 9. Consider Database-Specific Features

Some databases offer features that can simplify transaction management or improve performance. For example, PostgreSQL supports advisory locks, which can be used to prevent concurrent modifications to specific resources. Explore the features of your database and leverage them when appropriate.

### 10. Monitor Transaction Performance

Monitor the performance of your transactions to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. Use database monitoring tools to track transaction duration, lock contention, and other relevant metrics.

## Conclusion

Implementing transactions correctly is essential for maintaining data consistency and reliability in your NestJS applications. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your transactions are robust, efficient, and easy to maintain. Remember to choose the right ORM (TypeORM or Sequelize) based on your project's needs and preferences, and always prioritize thorough testing and error handling. With careful planning and implementation, you can build NestJS applications that handle database interactions with confidence.
