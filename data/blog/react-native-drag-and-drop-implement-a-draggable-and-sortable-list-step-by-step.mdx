# React Native Drag and Drop: Implement a Draggable & Sortable List (Step-by-Step)

Creating interactive user interfaces is crucial for engaging mobile apps. One common requirement is implementing a draggable and sortable list, allowing users to rearrange items as they see fit. This post provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to achieve this in React Native, with clear code examples and explanations. We'll explore different approaches, weigh their pros and cons, and offer best practices for a smooth and performant drag-and-drop experience.

## Why Implement a Draggable and Sortable List?

Draggable and sortable lists enhance user experience in various scenarios, including:

- **To-do lists:** Prioritizing tasks by dragging them up or down.
- **Playlist management:** Reordering songs in a playlist.
- **Product listings:** Rearranging items based on preference or custom criteria.
- **Customizable dashboards:** Allowing users to organize widgets and modules.

By enabling users to control the order of items, you provide a more intuitive and personalized experience, leading to increased engagement and satisfaction.

## Approaches to Implementing Drag and Drop in React Native

There are several libraries and techniques available for implementing drag and drop functionality in React Native. Here are a few popular options:

1.  **`react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated` (Recommended):** This combination offers excellent performance and flexibility. `react-native-gesture-handler` provides native-driven gesture recognition, while `react-native-reanimated` allows you to animate components based on gesture events with near-native performance. This is generally considered the most robust solution for complex drag-and-drop interactions.

2.  **`react-native-draggable-flatlist`:** This library is a higher-level component built on top of `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated`. It simplifies the implementation of draggable FlatLists significantly, handling much of the low-level gesture management. This is a good option if you need a quick and easy solution.

3.  **Using `PanResponder` (Less Recommended for complex lists):** React Native's `PanResponder` provides a way to handle touch events and track gestures. While it's a viable option, it requires more manual management of gesture states and animations, making it less performant and more complex for long or highly interactive lists.

In this tutorial, we'll focus on using **`react-native-draggable-flatlist`** for its simplicity and ease of use, while highlighting some key concepts that can be adapted to the other approaches. It provides a good balance between control and convenience.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Implementing a Draggable FlatList with `react-native-draggable-flatlist`

Let's dive into the implementation.

### 1. Project Setup and Package Installation

First, create a new React Native project (if you don't already have one):

```plaintext
npx react-native init DraggableListExample
cd DraggableListExample
```

Next, install the necessary packages:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-draggable-flatlist react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated @react-native-community/masked-view
# OR
yarn add react-native-draggable-flatlist react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated @react-native-community/masked-view
```

**Important Note:** For `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated` to work correctly, you need to make some additional configurations.

- **For React Native >= 0.60:**

  - **Android:** Add the following line to your `android/app/build.gradle` file inside the `dependencies` block:

    ```plaintext
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.1.0' // or higher
    ```

  - **iOS:** Run `pod install` in your `ios` directory:

    ```plaintext
    cd ios
    pod install
    cd ..
    ```

- **`react-native-reanimated` specific setup:** Add the plugin to your `babel.config.js` file:

  ```plaintext
  module.exports = {
    presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
  }
  ```

  **IMPORTANT:** The `react-native-reanimated/plugin` plugin has to be listed **last** in the plugins array.

### 2. Basic Component Structure

Create a new file named `DraggableList.js` (or any name you prefer) and add the following basic component structure:

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native'
import DraggableFlatList from 'react-native-draggable-flatlist'

const DraggableList = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([
    { id: '1', label: 'Item 1' },
    { id: '2', label: 'Item 2' },
    { id: '3', label: 'Item 3' },
    { id: '4', label: 'Item 4' },
  ])

  const renderItem = ({ item, drag, isActive }) => {
    return (
      <TouchableOpacity
        style={[styles.item, isActive && styles.activeItem]}
        onLongPress={drag}
        disabled={isActive}
      >
        <Text style={styles.itemText}>{item.label}</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    )
  }

  return (
    <DraggableFlatList
      data={data}
      renderItem={renderItem}
      keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
      onDragEnd={({ data }) => setData(data)}
    />
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  item: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
  },
  activeItem: {
    backgroundColor: '#ddd',
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.25,
    shadowRadius: 3.84,
    elevation: 5,
  },
  itemText: {
    fontSize: 16,
  },
})

export default DraggableList
```

**Explanation:**

- **`useState`:** Manages the list data, initialized with a simple array of objects. Each object has an `id` and a `label`.
- **`DraggableFlatList`:** The core component from `react-native-draggable-flatlist`.
  - **`data`:** The array of items to display in the list.
  - **`renderItem`:** A function that renders each item in the list. This is where you define how each item will look. It receives the `item` data, a `drag` function (to initiate the drag), and an `isActive` flag (indicating if the item is currently being dragged).
  - **`keyExtractor`:** A function that extracts a unique key for each item. This is essential for efficient rendering and reordering of the list.
  - **`onDragEnd`:** A function that is called when the drag operation ends. It receives the updated `data` array, allowing you to update the state and persist the new order.
- **`renderItem` Function:**
  - **`onLongPress={drag}`:** This crucial line attaches the `drag` function to the `onLongPress` event. When the user presses and holds an item, the `drag` function is called, initiating the drag operation.
  - **`disabled={isActive}`:** Disables the `TouchableOpacity` while the item is actively being dragged. This is important for preventing unwanted interactions.
  - **`isActive` Style:** The `isActive` flag is used to visually highlight the item being dragged, providing visual feedback to the user.

### 3. Integration into `App.js` (or your main component)

Import the `DraggableList` component into your `App.js` (or your main application component) and render it:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native'
import DraggableList from './DraggableList' // Adjust the path if needed

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <DraggableList />
    </SafeAreaView>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
})

export default App
```

**Important:** Ensure that you have wrapped your main app component with `<SafeAreaView>` or `<View>` component. This ensures that the list renders correctly within the safe area of the device screen, avoiding overlaps with the status bar or navigation bar.

### 4. Handle Gesture Handler (crucial for Android)

If you're targeting Android, you need to add the following to the very top of your `App.js` (or main component) file:

```plaintext
import 'react-native-gesture-handler'
```

This is required to properly initialize the gesture handler library.

### 5. Testing the Implementation

Run your React Native application. You should now see a list of items. Press and hold on an item, and you should be able to drag it up or down to reorder the list. Release the item to drop it into its new position.

## Customization and Enhancements

Here are some ways to customize and enhance your draggable list:

- **Custom Item Appearance:** Modify the styles in the `styles` object to change the appearance of the list items, including colors, fonts, padding, and borders. You can add more complex layouts and components within the `renderItem` function.
- **Animated Drag Feedback:** Use `react-native-reanimated` to create more sophisticated animations when an item is being dragged. You can change the opacity, scale, or position of the item to provide smoother visual feedback. The library `react-native-draggable-flatlist` itself already leverages reanimated but you can add even more complex animations.
- **Handle Component:** The `react-native-draggable-flatlist` can take advantage of `dragItemProps` parameter for styling when the item is being dragged. You can add some custom style to the dragged item or add a special handler (a small area on the item) to initiate the drag operation, instead of the whole item area. To achieve this use the `dragItemProps` like the example below:

```plaintext
const renderItem = ({ item, drag, isActive }) => {
  return (
    <View style={[styles.item, isActive && styles.activeItem]}>
      <Text style={styles.itemText}>{item.label}</Text>
      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.dragHandle} onLongPress={drag}>
        <Text>Drag</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  )
}

return (
  <DraggableFlatList
    data={data}
    renderItem={renderItem}
    keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
    onDragEnd={({ data }) => setData(data)}
    dragItemProps={{ disabled: false, style: styles.dragging }} //Enable and change style when dragging
  />
)
```

```plaintext
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  item: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  activeItem: {
    backgroundColor: '#ddd',
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
    shadowOpacity: 0.25,
    shadowRadius: 3.84,
    elevation: 5,
  },
  itemText: {
    fontSize: 16,
  },
  dragHandle: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  dragging: {
    //Custom style for element dragged
    opacity: 0.5,
  },
})
```

- **Persisting the Order:** Store the reordered list data in local storage (using `AsyncStorage`) or on a server to persist the order across app sessions.
- **Adding Delete Functionality:** Include a button or swipe gesture to delete items from the list. Update the `data` array accordingly.
- **Drag Restrictions:** Implement logic to restrict dragging to certain areas or to prevent items from being moved above or below specific boundaries.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure your draggable list is accessible to users with disabilities by providing appropriate ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. Consider using `AccessibilityInfo` from React Native to announce changes in the list order.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Conditionally render different components based on the state of the item (e.g., display different icons or buttons based on the item's properties).

## Performance Considerations

When working with draggable lists, especially with a large number of items, performance is critical. Here are some tips for optimizing performance:

- **`keyExtractor`:** Ensure you have a unique and stable `keyExtractor` function. This is crucial for React Native to efficiently track and update the list items.
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` to memoize the `renderItem` component. This prevents unnecessary re-renders when the data hasn't changed.
- **Virtualized Lists:** If you have a very large list, consider using a virtualized list (like `FlatList` or `SectionList`) to only render the items that are currently visible on the screen. `DraggableFlatList` is built on top of `FlatList`, so it benefits from its virtualization capabilities.
- **Offload Heavy Calculations:** Avoid performing complex calculations or operations within the `renderItem` function. Pre-calculate values or use background processes if necessary.
- **Native Driver for Animations:** Use the native driver in `react-native-reanimated` for animations to offload animation calculations to the native side, improving performance.
