# Creating a Custom User Model in Django: A Comprehensive Guide

Django's built-in user model is powerful and sufficient for many projects. However, there are situations where you need more flexibility and control over your user data. This is where creating a custom user model becomes essential. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a custom user model in Django, explaining the key concepts and providing code examples along the way.

## Why Use a Custom User Model?

There are several compelling reasons to use a custom user model in Django:

- **Adding Custom Fields:** The default user model includes standard fields like username, email, first name, and last name. If you need to store additional information about your users (e.g., date of birth, profile picture, membership tier), a custom model allows you to add those fields directly.

- **Replacing the Username Field:** The default user model uses a username field for authentication. If you prefer to authenticate users using their email address or another unique identifier, a custom user model allows you to change the `USERNAME_FIELD`.

- **Custom Authentication Logic:** You might want to implement custom authentication logic, such as using a different password hashing algorithm or integrating with an external authentication provider. A custom user model allows you to override the default authentication methods.

- **Future-Proofing Your Application:** Even if you don't need custom fields _now_, creating a custom user model from the start can make your application more adaptable to future requirements. It's often easier to add fields to an existing custom model than to migrate data from the default model later.

## Choosing the Right Approach

Django offers two main approaches for creating a custom user model:

1.  **AbstractBaseUser:** This approach provides a complete, bare-bones implementation of the user model. You are responsible for defining all the required fields and methods. This is the most flexible approach, but it also requires the most work.

2.  **AbstractUser:** This approach inherits from the default user model and provides all its fields and methods. You can then add or override fields and methods as needed. This is a simpler approach if you want to keep most of the default functionality.

For most cases, **AbstractUser** provides a good balance between flexibility and ease of use. This guide will focus on using `AbstractUser`.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Let's walk through the steps of creating a custom user model using `AbstractUser`.

### 1. Create a New Django Project and App (if you don't already have one)

First, create a new Django project and a new app to house your custom user model:

```plaintext
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp users
```

### 2. Define Your Custom User Model

In the `users/models.py` file, define your custom user model by inheriting from `AbstractUser`:

```plaintext
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    # Add any custom fields here
    age = models.PositiveIntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    profile_picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='profile_pictures/', null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `AbstractUser` from `django.contrib.auth.models` and `models` from `django.db`.
- We create a class `CustomUser` that inherits from `AbstractUser`.
- We add two custom fields: `age` (a positive integer, nullable and blank) and `profile_picture` (an image field, nullable and blank, uploaded to the `profile_pictures/` directory).
- We override the `__str__` method to return the username. This is good practice for representing the user object.

**Note on `upload_to` for ImageField:** Remember to configure your `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` in your `settings.py` file to handle uploaded media files.

### 3. Configure Django to Use Your Custom User Model

In your project's `settings.py` file, add the following line to tell Django to use your custom user model:

```plaintext
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.CustomUser'
```

**Important:** This setting _must_ be added **before** running `makemigrations` for the first time after creating the `users` app.

### 4. Create and Apply Migrations

Now, create and apply the migrations to update your database schema:

```plaintext
python manage.py makemigrations users
python manage.py migrate
```

This will create a migration file that reflects the changes you made to the `CustomUser` model and then apply those changes to your database.

### 5. Customize the Admin Interface (Optional)

If you want to customize how your custom user model is displayed in the Django admin interface, create an `admin.py` file in your `users` app and register your model with a custom admin class:

```plaintext
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ['username', 'email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'age', 'is_staff'] # Add 'age' to the list display
    fieldsets = (
        (None, {'fields': ('username', 'password')}),
        ('Personal info', {'fields': ('first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'age', 'profile_picture')}), # Add 'age' and 'profile_picture' to fieldsets
        ('Permissions', {'fields': ('is_active', 'is_staff', 'is_superuser', 'groups', 'user_permissions')}),
        ('Important dates', {'fields': ('last_login', 'date_joined')}),
    )
    add_fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'classes': ('wide',),
            'fields': ('username', 'email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'password', 'password2'), # Add 'email' here if you want to create users via email in admin
        }),
    )

admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `admin`, `UserAdmin` (from `django.contrib.auth.admin`), and your `CustomUser` model.
- We create a `CustomUserAdmin` class that inherits from `UserAdmin`. This allows us to customize the admin interface for our custom user model.
- `list_display` specifies the fields to display in the list view of the admin interface. We added 'age' to display the custom age field.
- `fieldsets` defines how the fields are organized in the edit view of the admin interface. We've added 'age' and 'profile_picture' to the Personal info fieldset.
- `add_fieldsets` defines the fields to display when creating a new user in the admin interface. You can modify this to suit your needs, for instance to enable creating users via email in the admin interface.
- Finally, we register `CustomUser` with `CustomUserAdmin` in the admin site.

### 6. Using Your Custom User Model

Now that you have a custom user model, you can use it throughout your application just like the default user model. You can access user instances using `CustomUser.objects.get()` or `CustomUser.objects.filter()`, and you can use the `authenticate()` function from `django.contrib.auth` to authenticate users.

**Example: Creating a new user**

```plaintext
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

User = get_user_model()

user = User.objects.create_user(
    username='testuser',
    password='testpassword',
    email='test@example.com',
    first_name='Test',
    last_name='User',
    age=30
)

user.save()
```

**Explanation:**

- We use `get_user_model()` to dynamically get the active user model (which is our `CustomUser` in this case).
- We create a new user using `User.objects.create_user()`. We pass in the required fields (username, password) and any other fields we want to set, including our custom `age` field.
- We save the user object to the database.

**Example: Authenticating a user**

```plaintext
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate

user = authenticate(username='testuser', password='testpassword')

if user is not None:
    # Authentication successful
    print("User authenticated!")
else:
    # Authentication failed
    print("Authentication failed.")
```

**Explanation:**

- We use `authenticate()` to check if the given username and password match a user in the database.
- If `authenticate()` returns a user object, authentication was successful. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

### 7. Handling Email as Username (Common Use Case)

A very common requirement is to use the email address instead of the username for authentication. Here's how you would modify the above steps to achieve this:

**a. Modify the Model:**

```plaintext
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    email = models.EmailField('email address', unique=True)
    age = models.PositiveIntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    profile_picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='profile_pictures/', null=True, blank=True)

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['username']  # Email & Password are required by default.

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email # Represent user by email.  More meaningful.
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **`email = models.EmailField('email address', unique=True)`:** We add an `email` field and make it `unique=True` to ensure that each user has a unique email address. The verbose name is also set. Although `AbstractUser` also has an email field, we are replacing it here.
- **`USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'`:** We set the `USERNAME_FIELD` to 'email', indicating that the email address will be used for authentication.
- **`REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['username']`:** We set `REQUIRED_FIELDS` to `['username']`. By default `REQUIRED_FIELDS` includes email. Because we are making email the `USERNAME_FIELD` it is already required, so we remove it from here. Note that `password` is _always_ implicitly required. If you did not have email as the USERNAME_FIELD, you would still list it in REQUIRED_FIELDS if you wanted to make sure it was always provided.

**b. Update Admin (Optional):**

You might need to adjust your `CustomUserAdmin` to reflect these changes, especially in the `add_fieldsets`. For example:

```plaintext
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ['email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'age', 'is_staff'] #Display Email
    fieldsets = (
        (None, {'fields': ('email', 'password')}), #Email and password instead of username
        ('Personal info', {'fields': ('first_name', 'last_name', 'age', 'profile_picture')}),
        ('Permissions', {'fields': ('is_active', 'is_staff', 'is_superuser', 'groups', 'user_permissions')}),
        ('Important dates', {'fields': ('last_login', 'date_joined')}),
    )
    add_fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'classes': ('wide',),
            'fields': ('email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'password', 'password2'),
        }),
    )
admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
```

The critical change here is using `email` instead of `username` in the admin display and fieldsets.

**c. Update Authentication:**

When you use `authenticate()`, you'll now need to pass the email address as the username:

```plaintext
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate

user = authenticate(username='user@example.com', password='testpassword') #Using email to authenticate
```

**d. Update Forms:**

If you have any custom forms that deal with authentication (login forms, registration forms), make sure they are updated to use the email field instead of the username field. You will likely need to adjust the fields used in your forms.

**e. Makemigrations and Migrate:**

Don't forget to run:

```plaintext
python manage.py makemigrations users
python manage.py migrate
```

to apply the changes to your database.

## Important Considerations

- **Migrations:** Always run `makemigrations` and `migrate` after making changes to your user model.
- **Existing Data:** If you're switching to a custom user model in an existing project with user data, you'll need to carefully plan your data migration strategy. Tools like `django-migration-linter` can help you identify potential issues. Consider using data migrations to transfer data safely.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your custom user model and authentication logic to ensure it works as expected.
- **Security:** Pay close attention to security best practices when implementing custom authentication logic.
- **Third-party Packages:** Many third-party packages (e.g., social authentication libraries) may need to be configured to work with your custom user model.
