# Mastering Nested Navigation with Expo Router: A Comprehensive Guide

Expo Router provides a powerful and intuitive way to handle navigation in your React Native Expo applications. One of its key strengths is the ability to create complex, nested navigation structures that mirror your app's information architecture. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about using nested navigators with Expo Router, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

## What is Nested Navigation?

Nested navigation refers to creating navigation structures where one navigator is embedded within another. This allows you to organize your app's screens into hierarchical groups, making it easier for users to navigate and understand your app's content. Think of it like folders within folders on your computer.

For example, you might have a tab navigator at the top level of your app (Home, Search, Profile), and then within the "Profile" tab, you have a stack navigator that manages screens like "Edit Profile", "Settings", and "Privacy".

## Why Use Nested Navigation?

Nested navigation offers several benefits:

- **Improved User Experience:** Provides a clear and intuitive way for users to navigate through related screens.
- **Better Code Organization:** Keeps your navigation logic organized and maintainable by grouping related screens together.
- **Enhanced Reusability:** Allows you to reuse navigation components in different parts of your app.
- **Simplified State Management:** Can make state management easier by scoping navigation state to specific areas of your app.

## Setting Up Expo Router

First, make sure you have an Expo project initialized with Expo Router. If you don't, you can create one using the following command:

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app -t with-router
```

This will create a new Expo project with the Expo Router pre-configured.

## Basic Nested Navigation with Stack Navigators

Let's start with a simple example of nesting a stack navigator within another stack navigator. Imagine an app with an authentication flow and then a main app flow.

**1. Directory Structure:**

Expo Router uses a file-based routing system. Navigation structures are determined by the directory structure within the `app` directory.

```
app/
├── _layout.tsx
├── index.tsx      # Home screen
├── (auth)/
│   ├── _layout.tsx   # Auth layout
│   ├── login.tsx    # Login screen
│   └── register.tsx   # Register screen
└── (main)/
    ├── _layout.tsx   # Main app layout
    ├── profile/
    │   ├── _layout.tsx  # Profile layout
    │   ├── index.tsx   # Profile screen
    │   └── edit.tsx    # Edit Profile screen
    └── settings.tsx  # Settings Screen
```

- `app/_layout.tsx`: The root layout file. This will wrap all other routes.
- `app/index.tsx`: This is the home screen of the app.
- `app/(auth)/`: A group representing the authentication flow.
- `app/(auth)/_layout.tsx`: Layout for the authentication flow, wrapping login and register.
- `app/(auth)/login.tsx`: The login screen.
- `app/(auth)/register.tsx`: The register screen.
- `app/(main)/`: A group representing the main app.
- `app/(main)/_layout.tsx`: Layout for the main app.
- `app/(main)/profile/`: A folder representing the profile section.
- `app/(main)/profile/_layout.tsx`: Layout for the profile section, wrapping the profile and edit screens.
- `app/(main)/profile/index.tsx`: The main profile screen.
- `app/(main)/profile/edit.tsx`: The edit profile screen.
- `app/(main)/settings.tsx`: The settings screen.

**2. Code Examples:**

Let's define the layout components:

**`app/_layout.tsx` (Root Layout):**

```tsx
import { Slot } from 'expo-router'
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context'

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
      <Slot />
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  )
}
```

**`app/(auth)/_layout.tsx` (Auth Layout):**

```tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import React from 'react'

export default function AuthLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
      <Stack.Screen name="login" options={{ title: 'Login' }} />
      <Stack.Screen name="register" options={{ title: 'Register' }} />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

**`app/(main)/_layout.tsx` (Main App Layout):**

```tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import React from 'react'

export default function MainLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: true }}>
      <Stack.Screen name="settings" options={{ title: 'Settings' }} />
      <Stack.Screen name="profile" options={{ title: 'Profile' }} />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

**`app/(main)/profile/_layout.tsx` (Profile Layout):**

```tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import React from 'react'

export default function ProfileLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: true }}>
      <Stack.Screen name="index" options={{ title: 'Profile' }} />
      <Stack.Screen name="edit" options={{ title: 'Edit Profile' }} />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

**3. Screen Components (Example):**

**`app/(auth)/login.tsx`:**

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native'

export default function LoginScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Login Screen</Text>
      <Button title="Login" onPress={() => alert('Login Pressed!')} />
      <Link href="/register">
        <Text>Don't have an account? Register</Text>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/">
        <Text>Go to Home</Text>
      </Link>
    </View>
  )
}
```

**`app/(main)/profile/index.tsx`:**

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native'

export default function ProfileScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Profile Screen</Text>
      <Button title="View Profile" onPress={() => alert('View Profile Pressed!')} />
      <Link href="edit">
        <Text>Edit Profile</Text>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/settings">
        <Text>Go to Settings</Text>
      </Link>
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Each `_layout.tsx` file defines a stack navigator using `<Stack>`.
- `<Stack.Screen>` components define the individual screens within each stack. The `name` prop corresponds to the filename (without the extension) within the respective directory.
- The `Link` component is used to navigate between screens. The `href` prop specifies the path to navigate to. Notice how we use relative paths within the `profile` directory (e.g., `href="edit"`). For navigating to sibling directories, we would use `/settings` to go to the `settings.tsx` file.
- The `index.tsx` files become the default routes for their respective directories (e.g., `/profile` will render `app/(main)/profile/index.tsx`).

## Using Tab Navigators and Drawer Navigators

Expo Router also supports tab and drawer navigators. You can nest these within stack navigators or use them as the root navigator.

**Example with Tab Navigator:**

Let's modify the main app layout to use a tab navigator:

**`app/(main)/_layout.tsx` (Main App Layout):**

```tsx
import { Tabs } from 'expo-router'
import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons'
import React from 'react'

export default function MainLayout() {
  return (
    <Tabs
      screenOptions={({ route }) => ({
        tabBarIcon: ({ focused, color, size }) => {
          let iconName

          if (route.name === 'profile') {
            iconName = focused ? 'ios-person' : 'ios-person-outline'
          } else if (route.name === 'settings') {
            iconName = focused ? 'ios-settings' : 'ios-settings-outline'
          }

          // You can return any component that you like here!
          return <Ionicons name={iconName} size={size} color={color} />
        },
        tabBarActiveTintColor: 'tomato',
        tabBarInactiveTintColor: 'gray',
        headerShown: false, // Hide header for tab screens
      })}
    >
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="profile"
        options={{
          tabBarLabel: 'Profile',
          title: 'Profile', // Title for the header if you want to show it.
        }}
      />
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="settings"
        options={{
          tabBarLabel: 'Settings',
          title: 'Settings', // Title for the header if you want to show it.
        }}
      />
    </Tabs>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We've replaced `<Stack>` with `<Tabs>`.
- We use `Tabs.Screen` to define each tab. The `name` prop again corresponds to the file name.
- The `tabBarLabel` and `title` options control the text displayed on the tab bar and the header, respectively. We set `headerShown: false` because we generally want to hide the header with tab navigators, but you might want to show it in some cases.
- The `screenOptions` prop allows us to customize the appearance of the tab bar and the screens. In this example, we're using `Ionicons` to display icons for each tab.

**Similarly, you can use `<Drawer>` component from `expo-router` for drawer navigation. The principle remains the same - you use `Drawer.Screen` to define each screen within the drawer navigator.** Remember to install `@react-navigation/drawer` if you're using drawer navigators. Although Expo Router tries to make things as simple as possible, it still relies on `@react-navigation/*` libraries under the hood, so make sure you install the correct dependencies.

## Passing Data Between Screens

Passing data between screens in nested navigators is straightforward using Expo Router. You can use route parameters or global state management solutions like Zustand or Recoil.

**1. Route Parameters:**

You can pass data in the URL when navigating. Expo Router automatically parses these parameters.

**Example:**

In `app/(main)/profile/index.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Link } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native'

export default function ProfileScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Profile Screen</Text>
      <Link href={{ pathname: 'edit', params: { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 } }}>
        <Text>Edit Profile with Data</Text>
      </Link>
    </View>
  )
}
```

In `app/(main)/profile/edit.tsx`:

```tsx
import { useSearchParams } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

export default function EditProfileScreen() {
  const { name, age } = useSearchParams()

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Edit Profile Screen</Text>
      <Text>Name: {name}</Text>
      <Text>Age: {age}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We use the `Link` component to navigate to the `edit` screen and pass `name` and `age` as URL parameters using the `params` prop.
- In the `edit` screen, we use the `useSearchParams` hook from `expo-router` to access these parameters.

**2. Global State Management:**

For more complex data or data that needs to be shared across multiple screens, consider using a global state management solution like Zustand, Recoil, or Redux. These libraries provide a centralized store for your application's state, making it easy to access and update data from anywhere in your app. Integrating these libraries is outside the scope of this guide, but Expo Router works seamlessly with them.

## Advanced Techniques

- **Conditional Navigation:** You can use conditional logic to dynamically change the navigation structure based on certain conditions (e.g., user authentication status). For example, you might render the authentication stack (`(auth)`) if the user is not logged in, and the main app stack (`(main)`) if they are.

- **Deep Linking:** Expo Router provides built-in support for deep linking, allowing you to navigate to specific screens from external sources (e.g., a link in an email or a push notification).

- **Custom Transition Animations:** While Expo Router uses the default `react-navigation` transitions, you can customize these transitions to create more visually appealing navigation experiences. You'll need to delve into the `@react-navigation/*` libraries for this.

## Best Practices

- **Plan your navigation structure carefully:** Before you start coding, take the time to plan your app's navigation structure. Consider the user flow and how users will navigate between different parts of your app.
- **Keep your navigation logic organized:** Use layout files (`_layout.tsx`) to group related screens together and keep your navigation logic separate from your UI components.
- **Use descriptive route names:** Choose route names that are clear and easy to understand.
- **Test your navigation thoroughly:** Test your navigation on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that it works correctly.
- **Leverage folder/file structure** The mental model that Expo Router provides of the file system as your router configuration can be very easy to reason about if you follow it's recommended folder structure.
