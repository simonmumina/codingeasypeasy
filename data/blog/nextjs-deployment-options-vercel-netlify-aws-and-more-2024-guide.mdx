- **Limited Control:** Less control over the underlying infrastructure compared to self-hosting options.

**Deployment Example (Using Vercel CLI):**

1.  **Install the Vercel CLI:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

2.  **Log in to Vercel:**

    ```plaintext
    vercel login
    ```

3.  **Deploy your Next.js app:**

    ```plaintext
    vercel
    ```

    The Vercel CLI will guide you through the deployment process, asking you questions about your project and linking it to your Vercel account.

4.  **Configure `next.config.js` (if necessary):** For some advanced configurations or custom domains, you might need to configure `next.config.js`. For example, to explicitly set the output to `export` mode for static site generation:

    ```plaintext
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export',
    }

    module.exports = nextConfig
    ```

**Code Example (Serverless Function):**

Create a file in the `pages/api` directory, such as `pages/api/hello.js`:

```plaintext
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'Hello, world!' })
}
```

Vercel automatically recognizes and deploys this file as a serverless function. You can access it at `/api/hello`.

### 2. Netlify: Another Popular Serverless Platform

**Overview:** Netlify is another excellent platform for deploying Next.js applications using a JAMstack architecture (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup). It offers similar features to Vercel, including automatic deployments, global CDN, and serverless functions.

**Pros:**

- **Easy to Use:** Simple and intuitive interface with a focus on developer experience.
- **Automatic Deployments:** Deploys automatically from Git repositories on every push.
- **Global CDN:** Distributes your application globally for faster loading times.

    ```plaintext
    npm install -g netlify-cli
    ```

2.  **Log in to Netlify:**

    ```plaintext
    netlify login
    ```

3.  **Deploy your Next.js app:**

    ```plaintext
    netlify deploy --prod
    ```

    Or, to deploy to a draft URL for testing:

    ```plaintext
    netlify deploy
    ```

    The Netlify CLI will guide you through the deployment process, asking you questions about your project.

4.  **Configure Build Settings in `netlify.toml` (Recommended):** For more control, you can define your build and deployment settings in a `netlify.toml` file in your project's root:

    ```toml
    [build]
      command = "next build && next export" # or "npm run build && npm run export"
      publish = "out"  # The directory Next.js exports to

    [dev]
      framework = "#static" # Important for correctly serving static files locally
    ```

**Code Example (Serverless Function):**

Create a file in the `netlify/functions` directory, such as `netlify/functions/hello.js`:

```plaintext
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from Netlify Functions!' }),
  }
}
```

Netlify automatically recognizes and deploys this file as a serverless function. It's important to use the Netlify-specific function handler.

5.  **Map the API Gateway Endpoint to your Next.js Application:** Configure your Next.js application to call the API Gateway endpoint when needed.

**c) Amazon S3 and CloudFront (for Static Exports):**

1.  **Export your Next.js application to static HTML:**

    ```plaintext
    next build && next export
    ```

2.  **Create an S3 bucket:** Create an S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console to store your static files.
3.  **Upload your static files to S3:** Upload the contents of the `out` directory to your S3 bucket.
4.  **Create a CloudFront distribution:** Create a CloudFront distribution and configure it to serve content from your S3 bucket.
5.  **Configure your CloudFront distribution:** Configure your CloudFront distribution to use the appropriate cache settings and to redirect requests to the index.html file for single-page application routing.

**Code Example (Lambda Function - simplified):**

```plaintext
// Assumes you've built and exported your Next.js application
// This example is highly simplified and requires significant additional setup

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  // Serve the pre-rendered static files from S3 based on the requested path
  // (This would involve fetching from S3 and handling routing)

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: '<h1>Hello from AWS Lambda</h1>', // Replace with the actual file content
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/html',
    },
  }
}
```

**Important Note:** Deploying Next.js to Lambda directly for SSR is complex and often requires significant configuration. Consider using Vercel or Netlify for simpler serverless deployment, or explore more specialized solutions like Serverless Next.js (a community project) for optimized AWS Lambda deployments.
