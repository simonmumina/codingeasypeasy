# How to Check if a File is Malicious Using CMD (Windows): A Comprehensive Guide

In today's digital landscape, protecting your Windows system from malware and viruses is paramount. While dedicated antivirus software offers robust protection, understanding how to perform basic security checks using the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) provides an extra layer of defense. This guide will walk you through various methods to analyze files for malicious content directly from your terminal, empowering you to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats.

## Why Use CMD for Malware Detection?

While graphical antivirus programs are user-friendly, CMD offers several advantages:

- **Accessibility:** CMD is readily available on all Windows systems, requiring no additional software installation.
- **Automation:** CMD scripts can be created to automate file analysis tasks, saving time and effort.
- **Lightweight:** CMD utilizes minimal system resources compared to resource-intensive antivirus scans.
- **Complementary:** CMD-based checks can supplement your existing antivirus software, providing a more comprehensive security approach.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Enables the utilization of tools such as `certutil` for hashing files and `powershell` to interact with the virustotal API.

## 1. Verifying File Integrity with Checksums (Hashes)

A checksum, also known as a hash, is a unique fingerprint of a file. If the file is altered in any way, even by a single bit, the checksum will change. This makes checksums invaluable for verifying file integrity and detecting tampering.

**Common Hashing Algorithms:**

- **MD5:** (Message Digest 5) - An older algorithm, considered cryptographically broken and prone to collisions. Not recommended for security-critical applications, but useful for quick integrity checks.
- **SHA-1:** (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) - Similar to MD5, also considered vulnerable to collisions and should be avoided for security.
- **SHA-256:** (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) - A more secure and widely used hashing algorithm. Recommended for most file integrity checks.
- **SHA-512:** (Secure Hash Algorithm 512-bit) - Provides even greater security than SHA-256, but results in a larger hash value.

**Using `certutil` to Calculate Checksums:**

The `certutil` command-line utility, built into Windows, can calculate checksums using various algorithms.

**Example:** Calculating the SHA-256 hash of a file named `example.exe`:

```plaintext
certutil -hashfile example.exe SHA256
```

**Explanation:**

- `certutil`: The command-line tool for certificate management and other cryptographic functions.
- `-hashfile`: Specifies that we want to calculate the hash of a file.
- `example.exe`: The path to the file you want to analyze. Replace this with the actual path to your file.
- `SHA256`: The hashing algorithm to use. You can replace this with `MD5`, `SHA1`, or `SHA512`.

**Interpreting the Output:**

The command will output the calculated SHA-256 hash value.

```
SHA256 hash of example.exe:
634b1e0091c29c26180d5395a6e2d236777b58614274380728dd8bd72f108c12
CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
```

**Verifying a File's Integrity:**

To verify if a file is legitimate, you can compare the calculated checksum with a known, trusted checksum provided by the software vendor or a reliable source. If the checksums match, it's highly likely that the file hasn't been tampered with. If they don't match, the file could be corrupted or malicious.

**Best Practices for Checksum Verification:**

- Obtain checksums from trusted sources (e.g., the official website of the software vendor).
- Never rely solely on checksums for malware detection. Checksums only verify file integrity, not whether the file is inherently malicious.

## 2. Integrating with VirusTotal Using PowerShell

VirusTotal is a popular online service that analyzes files and URLs for malware using multiple antivirus engines. While there's no native CMD integration, you can leverage PowerShell to interact with the VirusTotal API and automate file scans.

**Prerequisites:**

- **VirusTotal API Key:** You'll need a free VirusTotal API key. Sign up for an account at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and obtain your API key from your profile settings.

**PowerShell Script for VirusTotal File Analysis:**

```powershell
# Replace with your VirusTotal API key
$apiKey = "YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY"

# Replace with the path to the file you want to analyze
$filePath = "C:\path\to\your\file.exe"

# Encode the file as a byte array
$fileBytes = [IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($filePath)

# Construct the request headers
$headers = @{
    "x-apikey" = $apiKey
}

# Construct the request body
$body = @{
    file = @{
        FileName = Split-Path -Leaf $filePath
        Content  = $fileBytes
    }
}

# Convert the request body to multipart/form-data
$multipartForm = New-Object System.Net.Http.MultipartFormDataContent

$byteArrayContent = New-Object System.Net.Http.ByteArrayContent -ArgumentList $fileBytes
$byteArrayContent.Headers.ContentType = [System.Net.Http.Headers.MediaTypeHeaderValue]::Parse("application/octet-stream")
$multipartForm.Add($byteArrayContent, "file", Split-Path -Leaf $filePath)

# Upload the file to VirusTotal
try {
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $multipartForm
}
catch {
    Write-Host "Error uploading file to VirusTotal: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    exit
}


# Get the analysis ID from the response
$analysisId = $response.data.id

Write-Host "File uploaded to VirusTotal. Analysis ID: $analysisId"

# Wait for the analysis to complete (Polling)
$analysisUrl = "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/analyses/$analysisId"
$completed = $false
$counter = 0

while (-not $completed -and $counter -lt 60) { # Try for 60 seconds
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 1

    try {
        $analysisResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $analysisUrl -Method Get -Headers $headers
        $status = $analysisResponse.data.attributes.status
        Write-Host "Analysis Status: $status"
        if ($status -eq "completed") {
            $completed = $true
        }
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "Error getting analysis status: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        exit
    }

    $counter++
}


# Get the analysis results
if ($completed) {
    try {
    $resultsUrl = "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/$($response.data.id.Split('-')[0])"
    $fileInfo = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $resultsUrl -Method Get -Headers $headers
    $scanResults = $fileInfo.data.attributes.last_analysis_results

    Write-Host "--- VirusTotal Scan Results ---"

    foreach ($engine in $scanResults.GetEnumerator()) {
        Write-Host "$($engine.Key): $($engine.Value.category)"
    }

        # Check for malicious detections
        $maliciousDetections = $scanResults.Values | Where-Object { $_.category -eq "malicious" }
        if ($maliciousDetections.Count -gt 0) {
            Write-Host "WARNING: This file has been flagged as malicious by multiple engines."
        } else {
            Write-Host "File appears to be clean based on VirusTotal's scan results."
        }
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "Error getting analysis results: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    }

}
else {
    Write-Host "Analysis did not complete within the timeout period."
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **API Key and File Path:** Replace `YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` with your actual VirusTotal API key and `C:\path\to\your\file.exe` with the path to the file you want to scan.
2.  **File Encoding:** The script reads the file as a byte array, which is required for the VirusTotal API.
3.  **Request Headers:** Sets the `x-apikey` header with your API key for authentication.
4.  **Request Body:** Constructs a multipart form data to include the file name and content.
5.  **File Upload:** Uses `Invoke-RestMethod` to upload the file to the VirusTotal API endpoint (`https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files`).
6.  **Analysis ID:** Extracts the analysis ID from the API response. This ID is used to track the progress of the scan and retrieve the results.
7.  **Polling for Completion:** The script periodically checks (polls) the VirusTotal API for the analysis status. This is necessary because the analysis can take some time to complete. The script waits for a minute with a delay of 1 second to avoid hitting API limits.
8.  **Retrieving Results:** Once the analysis is complete, the script retrieves the scan results from the VirusTotal API.
9.  **Displaying Results:** The script displays the scan results, including the verdict from each antivirus engine. It also highlights if any engines flagged the file as malicious.

**How to Run the Script:**

1.  Save the script as a `.ps1` file (e.g., `virustotal_scan.ps1`).
2.  Open PowerShell.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
4.  Execute the script using: `.\virustotal_scan.ps1`

**Important Considerations:**

- **API Rate Limits:** VirusTotal imposes API rate limits. Exceeding these limits may result in your API key being temporarily blocked. Check the VirusTotal API documentation for details on rate limits.
- **File Size Limit:** VirusTotal has a file size limit for free API users. Large files may not be able to be uploaded.
- **Privacy:** Uploading files to VirusTotal means sharing them with a third party. Be mindful of sensitive or confidential information.

## 3. Examining File Metadata with CMD

File metadata provides information about a file, such as its creation date, modification date, author, and more. While not a direct indicator of malware, suspicious metadata can be a red flag. For example, a recently created executable file in a system directory, or an executable with a strange author, might warrant further investigation.

**Using `dir` to View Basic Metadata:**

The `dir` command displays basic file metadata, including the file size, date, and time of creation and last modification.

```plaintext
dir example.exe
```

**Example Output:**

```
 Volume in drive C is Windows
 Volume Serial Number is ABCD-1234

 Directory of C:\path\to\your\file

10/26/2024  10:00 AM           123,456 example.exe
               1 File(s)        123,456 bytes
               0 Dir(s)  123,456,789,012 bytes free
```

**Using PowerShell to Access Detailed Metadata:**

PowerShell provides access to more detailed file metadata through the `Get-Item` and `Get-FileHash` cmdlets.

```powershell
# Get file information
$file = Get-Item "C:\path\to\your\file.exe"

# Display file metadata
$file | Format-List *

# Get SHA256 hash (another way to calculate checksums)
Get-FileHash "C:\path\to\your\file.exe" -Algorithm SHA256
```

This command displays a wealth of information about the file, including:

- `CreationTime`: The date and time the file was created.
- `LastAccessTime`: The date and time the file was last accessed.
- `LastWriteTime`: The date and time the file was last modified.
- `Length`: The file size in bytes.
- `Attributes`: File attributes (e.g., ReadOnly, Hidden, System).

**Interpreting Metadata:**

- **Unexpected Location:** A file located in a temporary directory or a directory where executables are not normally found is suspicious.
- **Recent Creation Date:** A recently created executable file might be a newly dropped piece of malware.
- **Mismatch in Modification and Creation Dates:** If the modification date is significantly later than the creation date, it could indicate that the file has been tampered with.
- **Unusual File Size:** Compare the file size with the expected size or with known good files.
- **Hidden or System Attributes:** Malware often hides itself by setting the Hidden or System attributes.

## 4. Analyzing File Strings with `strings` (Requires External Tool)

The `strings` command extracts printable strings from a binary file. Analyzing these strings can reveal clues about the file's purpose and functionality. For example, strings might reveal URLs, API calls, or error messages that suggest malicious behavior.

**Note:** The `strings` command is not built into Windows. You'll need to download a version of it. A popular option is to obtain it from the Sysinternals Suite, a collection of advanced system utilities available from Microsoft.

**Downloading and Installing Sysinternals Suite:**

1.  Download the Sysinternals Suite from the Microsoft website: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite)
2.  Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\Sysinternals`).
3.  Add the directory containing the Sysinternals tools to your system's `PATH` environment variable so you can execute them from any command prompt.

**Using `strings` from CMD:**

```plaintext
strings example.exe
```

This command will output a long list of printable strings found within the `example.exe` file.

**Filtering and Analyzing Strings:**

The output of `strings` can be overwhelming. Use filtering and pattern matching to focus on potentially relevant strings.

- **Piping to `findstr`:** Use the `findstr` command to search for specific keywords or patterns.

  ```plaintext
  strings example.exe | findstr "http://"
  ```

  This command will search for all strings containing "http://", which could indicate network activity or links to malicious websites.

  ```plaintext
  strings example.exe | findstr "api."
  ```

  This command will search for all strings containing "api.", which could indicate api connections to malicious actors

- **Looking for URLs, IP addresses, or function names:** Pay attention to strings that resemble URLs, IP addresses, Windows API functions (e.g., `CreateProcess`, `RegSetValueEx`), or cryptographic functions.
- **Obfuscated Strings:** Be aware that malware often uses obfuscation techniques to hide strings. Look for strings that appear to be encoded or encrypted.

**Example:**

If the output of `strings` includes a string like `http://malicious.example.com/payload.exe`, it's a strong indication that the file might be attempting to download a malicious payload from a remote server.

## 5. Running in a Sandbox (Virtual Machine)

One of the safest methods of analyzing potentially malicious files is to run them in a sandbox environment, such as a virtual machine (VM). A VM isolates the file from your host operating system, preventing it from causing any damage if it is indeed malicious.

**Setting up a Virtual Machine:**

1.  **Choose a Virtualization Software:** Popular virtualization software options include:
    - VMware Workstation Player (Free for personal use)
    - VirtualBox (Free and open-source)
    - Hyper-V (Built into Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions)
2.  **Install the Virtualization Software:** Download and install your chosen virtualization software.
3.  **Create a New Virtual Machine:** Follow the instructions provided by your virtualization software to create a new VM. Choose an operating system that matches the file you want to analyze (e.g., Windows if you are analyzing a Windows executable).
4.  **Configure the VM:** Configure the VM's network settings to prevent it from accessing your local network or the internet during the initial analysis. This will prevent the malware from spreading or communicating with a command-and-control server.
5.  **Install Basic Tools:** Install basic tools in the VM that will help you analyze the file, such as a process monitor (Process Monitor from Sysinternals is excellent) and a network sniffer (Wireshark).

**Analyzing the File in the Sandbox:**

1.  **Transfer the File:** Transfer the potentially malicious file to the VM using a safe method (e.g., copying it from a USB drive that is not connected to your host system).
2.  **Run the File:** Execute the file in the VM.
3.  **Monitor System Activity:** Use the process monitor and network sniffer to observe the file's behavior. Look for:
    - Processes being created
    - Files being created or modified
    - Registry keys being changed
    - Network connections being established
4.  **Analyze the Data:** Analyze the data collected by the process monitor and network sniffer to determine if the file is exhibiting malicious behavior.

**Caution:**

- Even when using a sandbox, there's still a small risk of malware escaping the VM. Take precautions to isolate the VM as much as possible.
- After analyzing a potentially malicious file in a VM, it's recommended to completely delete the VM to ensure that any residual malware is removed.
