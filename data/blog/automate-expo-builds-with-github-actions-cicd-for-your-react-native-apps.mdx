# Automate Expo Builds with GitHub Actions: CI/CD for Your React Native Apps

Building and deploying React Native apps with Expo can be streamlined significantly using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. GitHub Actions provides a powerful and free platform to automate your build process, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments. This guide will walk you through setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to trigger Expo builds from your GitHub repository.

## Why Automate Expo Builds with GitHub Actions?

- **Automation:** Eliminates manual build and deployment steps, saving you time and reducing the risk of human error.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that your builds are always performed in a consistent environment, leading to more reliable results.
- **Early Detection of Errors:** Catches issues early in the development cycle, before they make their way into production.
- **Faster Release Cycles:** Automates the entire build and deployment process, allowing you to release updates more frequently.
- **Version Control Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with your GitHub repository, allowing you to trigger builds based on code changes.
- **Free for Public Repositories:** GitHub Actions is free for public repositories and offers a generous amount of free minutes for private repositories.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Expo Account:** You'll need an Expo account to build and publish your React Native app.
- **GitHub Repository:** Your React Native app should be hosted in a GitHub repository.
- **Expo CLI Installed:** Make sure you have Expo CLI installed locally for testing: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- **Expo EAS Account:** You will need an Expo EAS account to perform remote builds

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configure Expo EAS (Expo Application Services)

If you haven't already, configure your Expo project to use EAS Build. EAS Build allows you to build native binaries in the cloud, which is ideal for CI/CD.

First, initialize EAS Build in your project:

```plaintext
expo init --template tabs # Or your project name
cd your-project-name
eas init
```

You will be asked a few questions about your project. Choose the defaults or tailor them to your specific needs.

Next, build a development build to ensure everything is configured correctly. This also generates the necessary credentials for your project:

```plaintext
eas build --profile development --platform android
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

You might need to install `eas-cli` globally: `npm install -g eas-cli`. Make sure you are logged in to Expo CLI with `expo login` or `eas login`.

### 2. Store your Expo Credentials as GitHub Secrets

To allow GitHub Actions to build and deploy your Expo app, you need to securely store your Expo credentials as GitHub secrets.

- **`EXPO_TOKEN`:** This token is used to authenticate with Expo. You can generate it by running `expo whoami` and then `expo token:generate` in your terminal. Copy this token.
- **`APPLE_TEAM_ID` (Optional):** If building for iOS, you will likely need your Apple Team ID. Find this in your Apple Developer Portal.
- **`APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE` (Optional):** For production iOS builds, generate and store your distribution certificate. This is more complex and outside the scope of this basic guide, but is crucial for app store deployment.

To add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Click on "Settings" tab.
3.  Click on "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions".
4.  Click on "New repository secret".
5.  Enter the secret name (e.g., `EXPO_TOKEN`) and the corresponding value.
6.  Click "Add secret".
7.  Repeat steps 4-6 for each required secret. Make sure to include `APPLE_TEAM_ID` if you're building for iOS.

**Important Security Note:** Never commit your Expo credentials directly to your repository. Always use GitHub Secrets to protect sensitive information.

### 3. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow File

Create a new file named `.github/workflows/expo-build.yml` in your repository. This file will define your CI/CD workflow.

Here's an example workflow that triggers an Expo build when code is pushed to the `main` branch:

```plaintext
name: Expo Build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger build on pushes to the main branch

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Expo App
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18 # Or your preferred Node.js version

      - name: Install Expo CLI and dependencies
        run: |
          npm install -g eas-cli
          npm install

      - name: Configure Expo credentials
        run: |
          eas config-secret EXPO_TOKEN --value "${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}"

      - name: Build Android (Development Profile)
        run: eas build -p android --profile development --non-interactive
        env:
          EAS_NO_VCS: 1 # Disable Git version control integration within EAS

      - name: Build iOS (Development Profile)
        run: eas build -p ios --profile development --non-interactive
        env:
          EAS_NO_VCS: 1 # Disable Git version control integration within EAS
```

**Explanation:**

- **`name: Expo Build`:** Specifies the name of the workflow.
- **`on: push`:** Triggers the workflow when code is pushed to the specified branches (in this case, `main`). You can also trigger on pull requests.
- **`jobs: build`:** Defines a single job named `build`.
- **`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`:** Specifies that the job should run on an Ubuntu virtual machine.
- **`steps`:** Defines the individual steps that will be executed within the job.
  - **`actions/checkout@v3`:** Checks out the code from your repository.
  - **`actions/setup-node@v3`:** Sets up Node.js.
  - **`npm install -g eas-cli`:** Installs the Expo CLI globally.
  - **`npm install`:** Installs the project dependencies.
  - **`eas config-secret EXPO_TOKEN --value "${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}"`**: Configures the EXPO_TOKEN secret for EAS Builds
  - **`eas build -p android --profile development --non-interactive`:** Triggers an Android build using EAS Build with the "development" profile. The `--non-interactive` flag ensures that the build runs without prompting for user input.
  - **`eas build -p ios --profile development --non-interactive`:** Triggers an iOS build using EAS Build with the "development" profile.
  - **`EAS_NO_VCS: 1`**: This environment variable disables the git version control integration that EAS Build attempts. This prevents errors if your git repository is not in a clean state.

### 4. Commit and Push Your Workflow File

Commit the `.github/workflows/expo-build.yml` file to your GitHub repository and push the changes. This will automatically trigger the workflow.

```plaintext
git add .github/workflows/expo-build.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for Expo build"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Monitor Your Build

Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of your build. You can view the logs and see if any errors occur.

### 6. Production Builds and Deployment

The example above builds using the "development" profile which is great for testing. For production builds for submission to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you'll need to modify your workflow:

- **Use the `production` profile:** Replace `--profile development` with `--profile production` in your `eas build` commands.
- **Configure signing credentials:** For iOS, you'll need to configure your Apple distribution certificate and provisioning profile. Store the certificate as a secret (e.g., `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE`) and include steps in your workflow to install it in the keychain. For Android, you'll need to provide your keystore file.
- **Add deployment steps:** Once the build is complete, you'll need to deploy the resulting APK or IPA file to the app stores. You can use tools like `fastlane` to automate this process.

Here's an example of how to configure the signing credentials for iOS. This assumes you've stored your certificate as a base64 encoded string in the `APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE` secret:

```plaintext
- name: Install iOS distribution certificate
  env:
    KEYCHAIN_PATH: ~/Library/Keychains/expo-actions.keychain-db
    CERTIFICATE_P12_CONTENT: ${{ secrets.APPLE_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE }}
  run: |
    echo $CERTIFICATE_P12_CONTENT | base64 --decode --output certificate.p12
    security create-keychain -p ExpoActions $KEYCHAIN_PATH
    security set-keychain-settings -lut 21600 $KEYCHAIN_PATH
    security import certificate.p12 -k $KEYCHAIN_PATH -P "" -T /usr/bin/codesign
    security default-keychain -s $KEYCHAIN_PATH
    security unlock-keychain -p ExpoActions $KEYCHAIN_PATH
```

Remember to adapt the `KEYCHAIN_PATH` and the keychain password (`ExpoActions` in this example) to your specific configuration.

**Example Workflow snippet for production builds (Android):**

```plaintext
     - name: Build Android (Production Profile)
        run: eas build -p android --profile production --non-interactive
        env:
          EAS_NO_VCS: 1  # Disable Git version control integration within EAS
```

**Note**: Production builds generally take longer as they involve code signing and optimization steps.

### 7. Advanced Configurations

- **Trigger on Pull Requests:** You can configure your workflow to trigger builds on pull requests to validate changes before merging. Use the `pull_request` trigger in your workflow file.
- **Conditional Builds:** You might want to build only under certain conditions. For example, only build if certain files have changed. You can use the `paths` filter in your `push` or `pull_request` triggers.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to configure your build process, such as setting the Expo environment or providing API keys.
- **Caching:** Use GitHub Actions caching to speed up your builds by caching dependencies and build artifacts.

## Conclusion

Automating your Expo builds with GitHub Actions is a great way to improve your development workflow, ensure consistency, and accelerate your release cycles. By following the steps in this guide, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline for your React Native apps and deploy with confidence. Remember to tailor the workflow to your specific needs and take advantage of advanced configurations to further optimize your build process. Don't forget to configure the `production` profile and signing certificates when deploying to the app stores! Happy building!
