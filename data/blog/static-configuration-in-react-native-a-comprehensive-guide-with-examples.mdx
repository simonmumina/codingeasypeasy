# Static Configuration in React Native: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Managing configuration is a crucial aspect of building robust and maintainable React Native applications. Static configuration refers to settings and parameters that are defined at build time and remain constant during runtime. This contrasts with dynamic configuration, which can be modified without requiring a rebuild of the app. Effectively handling static configuration allows you to:

- **Differentiate environments:** Easily manage different API endpoints, database connections, and feature flags for development, staging, and production environments.
- **Simplify deployments:** Automate the deployment process by configuring environment-specific settings without manual intervention.
- **Improve security:** Prevent sensitive information like API keys from being hardcoded directly into your application code.
- **Increase maintainability:** Centralize configuration settings for easier management and updates.

This guide will explore various methods for managing static configuration in React Native, providing code examples and best practices for each approach.

## 1. Environment Variables

Environment variables are a common way to manage configuration data in software development. They provide a way to inject values into your application's runtime environment without directly modifying the code. In React Native, you can use libraries like `react-native-config` to access environment variables.

### 1.1. Installing `react-native-config`

First, install the `react-native-config` library:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-config --save
```

or

```plaintext
yarn add react-native-config
```

Then, link the library:

```plaintext
react-native link react-native-config
```

**Important:** For React Native versions >= 0.60, autolinking should handle this automatically. However, it's a good practice to verify the linking process. You might need to rebuild your app after linking.

### 1.2. Creating a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root of your React Native project. This file will contain your environment variables.

```
API_URL=https://development.example.com/api
APP_NAME=MyReactNativeAppDev
```

**Note:** Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information to your repository.

### 1.3. Accessing Environment Variables in Your Code

You can access environment variables using `Config` object from `react-native-config`.

```plaintext
import Config from 'react-native-config'

const apiUrl = Config.API_URL
const appName = Config.APP_NAME

console.log(`API URL: ${apiUrl}`)
console.log(`App Name: ${appName}`)
```

### 1.4. Configuring Native Projects

`react-native-config` also needs to be configured for the native iOS and Android projects to be accessible during the build process.

**iOS:**

1.  Open your project in Xcode.
2.  Select your project in the Project Navigator.
3.  Go to "Build Phases" and find "Copy Bundle Resources."
4.  Add a new "Run Script Phase" by clicking the "+" button and selecting "New Run Script Phase."
5.  Move the new "Run Script Phase" _before_ the "Compile Sources" phase.
6.  Paste the following script into the script editor:

    ```plaintext
    export NODE_BINARY=node
    ../node_modules/react-native-config/ios/ReactNativeConfig/Build/Build.xcconfig
    ```

**Android:**

No manual configuration is usually required for Android due to autolinking. However, ensure that the `react-native-config` package is properly linked. Check your `android/app/build.gradle` file for dependencies.

### 1.5. Different Environments

To manage different environments, you can use multiple `.env` files (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`). You can use environment variables at build time to specify which `.env` file to use.

For example, in your `package.json`:

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-native start",
    "android": "react-native run-android",
    "ios": "react-native run-ios",
    "android:staging": "ENVFILE=.env.staging react-native run-android",
    "ios:staging": "ENVFILE=.env.staging react-native run-ios",
    "android:production": "ENVFILE=.env.production react-native run-android",
    "ios:production": "ENVFILE=.env.production react-native run-ios"
  }
}
```

Then, you'll need to modify the Xcode and Gradle build processes slightly to respect this ENVFILE. The `react-native-config` documentation covers this in detail. For Android, ensure that you are using `project.ext.envConfigFiles = [file(".env")]` correctly in your `build.gradle`.

## 2. Build Variants (Schemes and Configurations)

Build variants allow you to create different versions of your application with specific settings for different environments. This is especially useful for iOS and Android apps.

### 2.1. iOS (Schemes and Configurations)

In Xcode, you can create different schemes and configurations to manage your build settings.

1.  **Create Configurations:** Go to your project settings, select the project (not the target), and then go to the "Info" tab. Under "Configurations," you will see "Debug" and "Release" configurations. You can duplicate these configurations for "Staging" and "Production."
2.  **Create Schemes:** Go to "Product" -> "Scheme" -> "Edit Scheme." You can duplicate existing schemes (e.g., "Debug" or "Release") and assign them to the appropriate configuration. For example, you might have a "Staging" scheme that uses the "Staging" configuration.
3.  **Define Build Settings:** For each configuration, you can define custom build settings. For example, you can define preprocessor macros in the "Build Settings" tab under "Apple Clang - Preprocessing." You can use these macros in your code to conditionally execute different code blocks based on the build configuration.

    ```plaintext
    #ifdef STAGING
    // Staging-specific code
    NSString *apiUrl = @"https://staging.example.com/api";
    #else
    // Production code
    NSString *apiUrl = @"https://production.example.com/api";
    #endif
    ```

**Accessing Build Settings from React Native:**

You can access build settings in your React Native code using libraries like `react-native-bundle-id`. While this specifically retrieves the bundle ID, the core principle of accessing native build variables remains the same. You would use similar techniques to access other build settings relevant to your configuration.
If you want to pass in the scheme from the native code, one way to do that is to define a User-Defined Setting within Xcode and create a Run Script Phase that writes that setting to a file. That file can then be read in the React Native layer.

### 2.2. Android (Build Types and Product Flavors)

In Android, you can use build types and product flavors to manage your build settings.

1.  **Build Types:** Build types define how your app is built and packaged (e.g., `debug`, `release`). You can configure build types in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.
2.  **Product Flavors:** Product flavors allow you to create different versions of your application with different features and settings. You can configure product flavors in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

```plaintext
android {
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://development.example.com/api\""
            applicationIdSuffix ".debug"
        }
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
            buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://production.example.com/api\""
        }
    }
    productFlavors {
        staging {
            applicationIdSuffix ".staging"
            buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://staging.example.com/api\""
        }
        production {
            buildConfigField "String", "API_URL", "\"https://production.example.com/api\""
        }
    }
    flavorDimensions "version" // important when using product flavors

    // Configure signing config for release builds
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }

}
```

**Accessing Build Config Variables in React Native:**

You can access build config variables from your React Native code using `BuildConfig`. This is automatically generated by Gradle based on your build configuration.

```plaintext
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native'

const apiUrl = NativeModules.BuildConfig.API_URL

console.log(`API URL: ${apiUrl}`)
```

**Important Note:** You will likely need to create a native module (or leverage an existing one like `react-native-build-config`) to expose the `BuildConfig` to your JavaScript layer directly. The example above assumes you have done that. Without a native module, you'll need to get the build config value into a resource file (strings.xml) and use a `string` resource within React Native.

## 3. Configuration Files (JSON, YAML)

Another approach is to store configuration data in separate files, such as JSON or YAML files. These files can then be loaded and parsed by your React Native application at startup. This provides a more structured way to manage configuration data compared to raw environment variables.

### 3.1. Creating Configuration Files

Create separate configuration files for each environment (e.g., `config.development.json`, `config.staging.json`, `config.production.json`).

**config.development.json:**

```plaintext
{
  "apiUrl": "https://development.example.com/api",
  "appName": "MyReactNativeAppDev",
  "debugMode": true
}
```

**config.staging.json:**

```plaintext
{
  "apiUrl": "https://staging.example.com/api",
  "appName": "MyReactNativeAppStaging",
  "debugMode": false
}
```

**config.production.json:**

```plaintext
{
  "apiUrl": "https://production.example.com/api",
  "appName": "MyReactNativeApp",
  "debugMode": false
}
```

### 3.2. Loading Configuration Files

Use the `fetch` API or `require` (for local files) to load the appropriate configuration file based on the current environment. The environment can be determined through environment variables or build variants, as described earlier.

```plaintext
async function loadConfig() {
  let configFileName

  // Determine the environment from an environment variable
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    configFileName = 'config.production.json'
  } else if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'staging') {
    configFileName = 'config.staging.json'
  } else {
    configFileName = 'config.development.json'
  }

  try {
    // If you are bundling the config files with your app:
    const configFile = require(`./${configFileName}`)
    return configFile

    // If fetching the file from a remote URL:
    // const response = await fetch(`https://example.com/configs/${configFileName}`);
    // const config = await response.json();
    // return config;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading configuration:', error)
    return null
  }
}

export default loadConfig

// Usage:
import loadConfig from './configLoader'

async function initializeApp() {
  const config = await loadConfig()
  if (config) {
    console.log('Config loaded:', config)
    // Use the config values
    const apiUrl = config.apiUrl
    // ...
  } else {
    // Handle the error appropriately - perhaps alert the user
    console.error('Failed to load configuration.  App may not function correctly.')
  }
}

initializeApp()
```

**Important Considerations for Bundling Configuration Files:**

- **Security:** If your configuration files contain sensitive information (like API keys), _do not bundle_ them directly with your app. This will expose them to anyone who decompiles your application. Instead, use environment variables or build variants, as these values are injected at build time and are not stored directly in the app bundle.
- **Update without Rebuild:** If you need the ability to update configuration settings without requiring a new app release, consider fetching the configuration files from a remote server. However, carefully consider the security implications of this approach.

### 3.3. Using YAML

If you prefer YAML over JSON, you can use libraries like `js-yaml` to parse YAML files.

```plaintext
npm install js-yaml --save
```

or

```plaintext
yarn add js-yaml
```

```plaintext
import yaml from 'js-yaml'
import fs from 'react-native-fs' // Assuming you're bundling the file

async function loadYamlConfig() {
  try {
    // Load the YAML file from disk (assuming you're bundling it)
    const yamlPath = `${fs.MainBundlePath}/config.yaml` // Change to your path
    const yamlContent = await fs.readFile(yamlPath, 'utf8')
    const config = yaml.load(yamlContent)
    return config
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading YAML config:', error)
    return null
  }
}

// Usage:
import loadYamlConfig from './configLoader'

async function initializeApp() {
  const config = await loadYamlConfig()
  if (config) {
    console.log('Config loaded:', config)
    // Use the config values
    const apiUrl = config.apiUrl
    // ...
  } else {
    // Handle the error appropriately - perhaps alert the user
    console.error('Failed to load configuration.  App may not function correctly.')
  }
}

initializeApp()
```

## 4. Best Practices

- **Prioritize Security:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys directly into your application code. Use environment variables or secure configuration management practices.
- **Use a Consistent Approach:** Choose a configuration management strategy that aligns with your project's needs and stick to it consistently.
- **Centralize Configuration:** Keep all configuration settings in a central location (e.g., `.env` file, build configuration files) for easier management and updates.
- **Automate Deployments:** Integrate your configuration management strategy with your deployment pipeline to automate the deployment process and reduce the risk of errors.
- **Document Configuration:** Clearly document the purpose and usage of each configuration setting to ensure that other developers can easily understand and maintain the application.
- **Leverage TypeScript:** Use TypeScript to define types for your configuration data to provide compile-time type checking and improve code reliability.
- **Consider using Configuration Management Tools:** For larger and more complex projects, consider using dedicated configuration management tools like Vault or Consul for managing sensitive configuration data.
