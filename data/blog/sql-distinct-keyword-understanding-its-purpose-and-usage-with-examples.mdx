# SQL DISTINCT Keyword: Understanding its Purpose and Usage with Examples

The `DISTINCT` keyword in SQL is a powerful tool for data analysis and reporting. It allows you to retrieve only the unique values from a column (or a combination of columns) in a table, effectively eliminating duplicate entries from your result set. This blog post will delve into the purpose of the `DISTINCT` keyword, explain its syntax, and provide numerous examples to illustrate its usage in various scenarios.

## What is the Purpose of the DISTINCT Keyword?

The primary purpose of the `DISTINCT` keyword is to **remove duplicate rows** from the result set of a `SELECT` query.  This is crucial when you're interested in understanding the *variety* of values in a column rather than the total number of rows. Imagine a table of customer orders. You might want to know how many *unique* products have been ordered, regardless of how many times each product appears in the table. This is where `DISTINCT` shines.

Without `DISTINCT`, a `SELECT` statement returns all rows that match the specified conditions, including duplicates.  Using `DISTINCT` ensures that each combination of values specified after the `SELECT` keyword appears only once in the result.

## Syntax of the DISTINCT Keyword

The syntax for using the `DISTINCT` keyword is straightforward:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition; -- Optional WHERE clause
```

*   **`SELECT DISTINCT`**: This specifies that you want to retrieve only unique combinations of values.
*   **`column1, column2, ...`**:  This is a comma-separated list of the columns you want to consider for uniqueness. If you list multiple columns, the `DISTINCT` keyword will return only the rows where the *combination* of values in these columns is unique.
*   **`FROM table_name`**:  This specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.
*   **`WHERE condition`**: This is an optional clause that allows you to filter the data based on specific conditions.

## Practical Examples of the DISTINCT Keyword

Let's illustrate the use of the `DISTINCT` keyword with some practical examples.  Suppose we have a table called `Customers` with the following structure and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Country VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, City, Country) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'New York', 'USA'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'London', 'UK'),
(3, 'Peter', 'Jones', 'New York', 'USA'),
(4, 'Alice', 'Brown', 'Paris', 'France'),
(5, 'John', 'Doe', 'New York', 'USA'),
(6, 'David', 'Lee', 'Tokyo', 'Japan'),
(7, 'Sarah', 'Wilson', 'London', 'UK'),
(8, 'Michael', 'Davis', 'Sydney', 'Australia');
```

### Example 1: Retrieving Unique Countries

To find out which countries are represented in the `Customers` table, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country
FROM Customers;
```

This query will return:

```
Country
-------
USA
UK
France
Japan
Australia
```

Notice that even though "USA" and "UK" appear multiple times in the `Customers` table, they only appear once in the result set.

### Example 2: Retrieving Unique Cities

Similarly, to find out the unique cities represented in the `Customers` table, we can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City
FROM Customers;
```

This will return:

```
City
--------
New York
London
Paris
Tokyo
Sydney
```

### Example 3: Retrieving Unique Combinations of City and Country

Now, let's say we want to find the unique combinations of city and country. We can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City, Country
FROM Customers;
```

This will return:

```
City       | Country
-----------|---------
New York   | USA
London     | UK
Paris      | France
Tokyo      | Japan
Sydney     | Australia
```

Notice that even though "New York" appears three times and "USA" appears three times in the original table, the combination "New York, USA" only appears once because the `DISTINCT` keyword considers the combination of values.

### Example 4: Using DISTINCT with a WHERE Clause

We can also use the `DISTINCT` keyword in conjunction with a `WHERE` clause. For example, if we want to find the unique cities only for customers from the USA, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'USA';
```

This will return:

```
City
--------
New York
```

### Example 5:  Counting Distinct Values

You can combine `DISTINCT` with the `COUNT()` function to count the number of unique values in a column. For example, to count the number of unique countries in the `Customers` table, you would use:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country)
FROM Customers;
```

This will return:

```
COUNT(DISTINCT Country)
-----------------------
5
```

## Important Considerations

*   **`DISTINCT` and `NULL` Values:**  The `DISTINCT` keyword treats `NULL` values as distinct.  If you have multiple rows with `NULL` in the selected column(s), `DISTINCT` will return a single `NULL` value.

*   **Performance:**  Using `DISTINCT` can impact the performance of your queries, especially on large tables.  The database engine needs to sort and compare all the rows to identify and eliminate duplicates. Consider using appropriate indexes to improve performance.

*   **`DISTINCT` vs. `GROUP BY`:**  In many cases, you can achieve the same result with `DISTINCT` and `GROUP BY`.  However, `GROUP BY` allows you to perform aggregate functions (like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) on the grouped data, which `DISTINCT` doesn't. If you need to aggregate data, `GROUP BY` is the more appropriate choice.  If you only need to retrieve unique values without any aggregation, `DISTINCT` is often simpler and more efficient.

## Conclusion

The `DISTINCT` keyword is a fundamental tool in SQL for retrieving unique values and eliminating duplicate rows. Understanding how to use `DISTINCT` effectively is essential for data analysis, reporting, and ensuring the accuracy of your query results.  By mastering the syntax and applying the practical examples discussed in this post, you can leverage the power of `DISTINCT` to gain valuable insights from your data.  Remember to consider performance implications and choose the most appropriate approach between `DISTINCT` and `GROUP BY` based on your specific requirements.
