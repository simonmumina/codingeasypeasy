# Troubleshooting Airflow Scheduler Issues: A Comprehensive Guide

The Airflow scheduler is the heart of your workflow orchestration system. It's responsible for parsing DAGs, scheduling tasks, and ensuring your data pipelines run on time. When the scheduler encounters problems, your entire data infrastructure can grind to a halt. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of common Airflow scheduler issues, along with practical troubleshooting steps and code examples to help you get back on track.

## Understanding the Airflow Scheduler

Before diving into troubleshooting, let's understand the scheduler's role.  The Airflow scheduler is a separate process (or multiple processes in a high-availability setup) that continuously:

*   **Parses DAGs:** Reads the Python files in your `dags_folder` and extracts the DAG definitions.
*   **Schedules Tasks:** Determines when tasks should run based on DAG dependencies, schedules, and past task states.
*   **Queues Tasks:** Places tasks in a queue (typically the Airflow database or a message queue like Celery) for execution by worker processes.

A malfunctioning scheduler manifests in several ways, including:

*   **DAGs not running:** DAGs that should be running aren't triggered according to their schedule.
*   **Tasks not starting:** Tasks are scheduled but remain in a queued or scheduled state indefinitely.
*   **Slow DAG parsing:** The scheduler takes a long time to parse DAGs, leading to delays in scheduling.
*   **High CPU/Memory usage:** The scheduler consumes excessive resources, potentially impacting other processes.
*   **Scheduler crashes:** The scheduler process terminates unexpectedly.

## Common Airflow Scheduler Issues and Solutions

Here's a breakdown of common problems and how to solve them:

### 1. DAG Parsing Errors

The most frequent issue arises from errors in your DAG files. These errors prevent the scheduler from parsing the DAG and scheduling its tasks.

**Symptoms:**

*   DAG does not appear in the Airflow UI.
*   Error messages in the scheduler logs related to DAG parsing.
*   The scheduler might become unresponsive or slow.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Check the Scheduler Logs:** The scheduler logs are your first point of contact.  Typically, these logs are located in the `logs/scheduler` directory (or configured in your `airflow.cfg`).  Look for `ERROR` or `WARNING` messages related to DAG parsing.
*   **Validate your DAG Syntax:** Use a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` to check your Python code for syntax errors and style violations.
*   **Simplify the DAG:**  Comment out sections of your DAG to isolate the error. Add print statements to verify the values of variables and the execution flow.
*   **Run `airflow dags parse`:**  This command parses a specific DAG file and displays any errors. This is the most direct way to find out why a dag is not parsed.

    ```bash
    airflow dags parse /path/to/your/dag.py
    ```

**Example:**

Let's say your DAG file contains a typo:

```python
# /path/to/your/dag.py
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='my_faulty_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task1 = BashOperator(
        task_id='print_date',
        bash_command='date',
        retries=3
    )

    # Oops, a typo!
    taks2 = BashOperator(
        task_id='print_hello',
        bash_command='echo "Hello, world!"',
        retries=3
    )

    task1 >> taks2
```

Running `airflow dags parse /path/to/your/dag.py` would output an error like:

```
Broken DAG: [/path/to/your/dag.py] name 'taks2' is not defined
```

**Solution:** Fix the typo in your DAG file.  Rename `taks2` to `task2`.

### 2. DAG Serialization Issues

Airflow 2.0 introduced DAG serialization, where DAG objects are serialized and stored in the database.  This can lead to issues if your DAGs contain objects that are not serializable (e.g., database connections, custom classes without proper serialization).

**Symptoms:**

*   Errors related to serialization in the scheduler logs.
*   DAGs appearing in the UI but not running.
*   The error `TypeError: Object of type X is not JSON serializable` or similar errors related to `pickle` or `json`.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Identify Non-Serializable Objects:** Review your DAG code for any objects that might not be serializable. This often involves custom classes, database connections, or complex data structures.
*   **Implement Serialization:** Use `pickle` or `json` libraries to serialize and deserialize the offending objects.  Consider using `dill` for more complex serialization scenarios.
*   **Move Non-Serializable Objects to Tasks:** The best practice is to avoid using complex objects in the DAG definition itself. Defer the creation and use of such objects to the task level.

**Example:**

```python
# /path/to/your/dag_with_db_connection.py
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import psycopg2

# Non-serializable database connection in the DAG definition
# This will cause serialization errors!
# conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydatabase user=myuser password=mypassword host=localhost")

def my_task_function():
    # Create the connection inside the task
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=mydatabase user=myuser password=mypassword host=localhost")
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT 1;")
    result = cur.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    print(f"Database result: {result}")

with DAG(
    dag_id='dag_with_db_connection',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='execute_query',
        python_callable=my_task_function
    )
```

**Solution:** Create the database connection within the `my_task_function` instead of at the DAG level. This ensures that the connection object is not serialized.

### 3. Time Zone Issues

Incorrect time zone configurations can lead to DAGs not running as expected. Airflow uses UTC internally, but you might be displaying times in a different time zone in the UI.

**Symptoms:**

*   DAGs running at unexpected times.
*   Differences between the scheduled time and the actual execution time.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Check `default_timezone` in `airflow.cfg`:** This setting controls the time zone used in the Airflow UI. Ensure it's configured correctly.
*   **Verify Server Time Zone:**  Make sure the server running the Airflow scheduler has the correct time zone set.
*   **Use `datetime` Objects with Time Zone Information:** When defining start dates or using time-related logic in your DAGs, use `datetime` objects that are aware of time zones.

**Example:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime, timezone

with DAG(
    dag_id='time_zone_aware_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),  # Specify UTC
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task1 = BashOperator(
        task_id='print_date',
        bash_command='date',
        retries=3
    )
```

**Solution:** Explicitly specify the `tzinfo` when creating `datetime` objects for start dates or other time-related calculations.

### 4. Scheduler Resource Limits

If the scheduler is overloaded, it might not be able to parse DAGs or schedule tasks effectively.

**Symptoms:**

*   High CPU and Memory usage for the scheduler process.
*   Slow DAG parsing.
*   Tasks remaining in a "scheduled" state for extended periods.
*   Scheduler crashes with "Out of Memory" errors.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Increase Scheduler Resources:**  Allocate more CPU and memory to the scheduler process.  This is especially important in resource-intensive environments.
*   **Optimize DAGs:**
    *   **Reduce DAG Complexity:** Break down large DAGs into smaller, more manageable units.
    *   **Optimize Imports:** Avoid unnecessary imports in the DAG definition.
    *   **Lazy Load Expensive Operations:**  Defer expensive operations (e.g., database connections, API calls) to the task level.
*   **Increase the `parsing_processes` and `min_file_process_interval` in airflow.cfg:** This helps speed up dag parsing and reduce processing time.
*   **Check for Deadlocks:** Use tools like `jstack` (for Java-based schedulers) to identify potential deadlocks in the scheduler process.

**Example:**

Let's say your DAG imports a large CSV file:

```python
# /path/to/your/resource_intensive_dag.py
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd

def read_csv_and_print():
    df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/large.csv')
    print(df.head())

with DAG(
    dag_id='resource_intensive_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='read_csv',
        python_callable=read_csv_and_print
    )
```

**Solution:**  Move the CSV reading to the task level and read only the necessary chunks of the CSV. Also consider using a faster data format like parquet if possible.

### 5. DAG Concurrency and Pool Limits

Airflow limits the number of concurrent DAG runs and task instances.  If these limits are reached, new DAG runs or tasks might be delayed.

**Symptoms:**

*   DAG runs or tasks remaining in a "queued" state.
*   "Max active DAG runs reached" or "No free slots available" errors in the logs.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Check `max_active_runs_per_dag` in `airflow.cfg`:** This setting controls the maximum number of concurrent DAG runs for each DAG.
*   **Check `parallelism` in `airflow.cfg`:** This setting controls the maximum number of tasks that can run concurrently across all DAGs.
*   **Use Pools:** Pools allow you to limit the concurrency of tasks that use a particular resource. Assign tasks to pools to prevent resource contention.
*   **Increase Concurrency Limits:** Carefully increase the `max_active_runs_per_dag` or `parallelism` settings if your infrastructure can handle the increased load.

**Example:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='concurrency_limited_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False,
    max_active_runs=1 # Limit concurrency to 1 run
) as dag:
    task1 = BashOperator(
        task_id='print_date',
        bash_command='date',
        retries=3,
        pool='my_resource_pool' # Assign to a pool
    )
```

**Solution:** Adjust `max_active_runs` or use pools to manage concurrency and prevent resource exhaustion.

### 6. Database Connection Issues

The scheduler relies on a database connection to store DAG definitions, task metadata, and scheduler state.  Problems with the database connection can cause scheduler failures.

**Symptoms:**

*   Errors related to database connectivity in the scheduler logs.
*   Scheduler failing to start or crashing frequently.
*   Tasks failing to update their status.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Verify Database Credentials:** Double-check the database connection details in your `airflow.cfg` file, including the host, port, username, password, and database name.
*   **Test the Database Connection:** Use a tool like `psql` (for PostgreSQL) or `mysql` (for MySQL) to connect to the database and verify that the credentials are correct.
*   **Check Database Server Status:**  Ensure that the database server is running and accessible from the scheduler host.
*   **Check Firewall Rules:** Verify that firewall rules are not blocking the connection between the scheduler and the database.
*   **Check Database Resource Limits:**  Ensure that the database server has enough resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to handle the load from the Airflow scheduler.
*   **Implement Connection Pooling:** Using a connection pool can improve database performance and reduce the overhead of establishing new connections. SQLAlchemy, which Airflow uses to interact with databases, has built in connection pooling capabilities.

**Example:**  (Connection pool example using SQLAlchemy in a custom operator):

```python
from airflow.models import BaseOperator
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

class MyDatabaseOperator(BaseOperator):
    template_fields = ('sql',)

    @apply_defaults
    def __init__(self,
                 sql,
                 database_uri,
                 *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyDatabaseOperator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.sql = sql
        self.database_uri = database_uri
        self.engine = None
        self.Session = None


    def execute(self, context):
        # Create a SQLAlchemy engine with connection pooling
        if not self.engine:
            self.engine = create_engine(self.database_uri, pool_size=5, max_overflow=10)  # Example pool settings
            self.Session = sessionmaker(bind=self.engine)

        session = self.Session()
        try:
            result = session.execute(self.sql)
            session.commit() # Or rollback if needed
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            session.rollback()
            raise e
        finally:
            session.close()
```

**Solution:** Resolve any database connectivity issues by verifying credentials, checking server status, adjusting firewall rules, and ensuring adequate database resources.

### 7. DAG File Processing Delays

The scheduler monitors the `dags_folder` for changes. If the scheduler takes too long to process DAG files, this can cause significant delays in task scheduling.

**Symptoms:**

*   Long delays between DAG file updates and the DAGs appearing in the Airflow UI.
*   High CPU usage for the scheduler process while scanning the `dags_folder`.
*   Scheduler logs showing "DAG file was imported more than once" or similar messages.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Reduce the Number of DAG Files:** Minimize the number of files in your `dags_folder`. Organize DAGs into subdirectories and import them as modules if necessary.
*   **Increase `min_file_process_interval`:** This setting in `airflow.cfg` controls the minimum interval between DAG file processing runs. Increase this value to reduce the frequency of file scanning if needed (but be aware this will delay the display of updates in the UI).
*   **Use `file_parsing_sort_mode`:**  This setting in `airflow.cfg` can improve DAG parsing performance.  Try setting it to `modified_time` or `alphabetical`.
*   **Implement DAG File Filtering:**  Use the `dag_discovery_safe_mode` and `plugins_folder` configuration to prevent the scheduler from trying to import problematic files.
*   **Use Symlinks Carefully:**  Avoid using circular symlinks within your `dags_folder`, as this can cause the scheduler to get stuck in an infinite loop.
*   **Optimize your DAG folder structure:** Ensure no unnecessary files and folder and folder is present in `dags_folder`.
*   **Consider KubernetesPodOperator for heavier tasks:**  offload the tasks to kubernetes worker pods if the main problem is lack of compute power.

**Solution:** Optimizing your DAG file structure, adjusting configuration settings, and avoiding circular symlinks can significantly improve DAG file processing performance.

### 8. Problems with External Dependencies

Airflow DAGs often depend on external services and libraries. If these dependencies are unavailable or misconfigured, the scheduler or tasks can fail.

**Symptoms:**

*   Errors related to missing Python packages in the scheduler or worker logs.
*   Connection errors to external databases, APIs, or other services.
*   Tasks failing with "ModuleNotFoundError" or "ImportError" exceptions.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Verify Python Package Dependencies:**  Ensure that all required Python packages are installed in the Airflow environment. Use `pip freeze` to list installed packages. Use virtualenv or conda to manage environment.
*   **Check Environment Variables:**  Ensure that all required environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys) are set correctly in the Airflow environment.
*   **Test Connectivity to External Services:** Use tools like `ping`, `telnet`, or `curl` to verify connectivity to external services.
*   **Check DNS Resolution:** Verify that DNS resolution is working correctly.
*   **Firewall:** Ensure your firewall settings do not prevent outbound connections to external services.
*   **Use Task Decorators or Hooks to Handle Dependencies:** Defer dependency handling to the task level rather than DAG level.

**Example:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime
import requests # You need to ensure `requests` is available in your environment

def call_api():
    response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")
    print(response.status_code)

with DAG(
    dag_id='external_dependency_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='call_api',
        python_callable=call_api
    )
```

**Solution:** Install the missing Python package (`pip install requests`) and verify that the environment is configured correctly.

### 9. Permissions Issues

If the Airflow scheduler does not have the necessary permissions to access DAG files, logs, or other resources, it can fail.

**Symptoms:**

*   "Permission denied" errors in the scheduler logs.
*   Scheduler failing to read or write files.
*   Tasks failing to access resources.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Verify File Permissions:** Ensure that the Airflow user has the necessary read and write permissions to the `dags_folder`, `logs_folder`, and any other relevant directories.
*   **Check User Ownership:** Verify that the files and directories are owned by the correct user and group.
*   **Review SELinux/AppArmor Configuration:** If SELinux or AppArmor is enabled, ensure that the Airflow process has the necessary permissions.
*   **Verify User Context:** Ensure that the Airflow process is running under the correct user context.

**Solution:** Adjust file permissions, user ownership, and SELinux/AppArmor configurations to grant the Airflow process the necessary access rights.

### 10. Scheduler Deadlock or Hang

In rare cases, the scheduler can get into a deadlock state, where it becomes unresponsive and stops processing DAGs and tasks.

**Symptoms:**

*   The scheduler appears to be running but is not processing any DAGs or tasks.
*   High CPU usage for the scheduler process.
*   No new entries in the scheduler logs.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Restart the Scheduler:** The simplest solution is often to restart the scheduler process.
*   **Analyze Thread Dumps:** Use tools like `jstack` (for Java-based schedulers) or `gdb` (for Python-based schedulers) to capture thread dumps and analyze the scheduler's internal state. Look for deadlocks or long-running threads.
*   **Identify Resource Contention:** Look for resource contention (e.g., database locks, file locks) that might be contributing to the deadlock.
*   **Review Custom Code:** If you have custom code running in the scheduler (e.g., custom DAG parsers), review it for potential deadlocks or race conditions.

**Solution:** Restart the scheduler, analyze thread dumps, identify resource contention, and review custom code to resolve deadlocks.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Preventing issues is better than reacting to them. Implement robust monitoring and alerting to catch scheduler problems early.

*   **Monitor Scheduler Logs:** Use a log management system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, Graylog) to monitor the scheduler logs for errors, warnings, and performance issues.
*   **Monitor Scheduler Metrics:** Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to track scheduler metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, DAG parsing time, and task queue length.
*   **Set Up Alerts:** Configure alerts to notify you when the scheduler encounters errors, exceeds resource limits, or experiences performance degradation.
*   **Use Health Checks:**  Configure regular health checks to verify that the scheduler is running and responsive.

## Best Practices for a Healthy Airflow Scheduler

*   **Keep DAGs Simple:** Avoid complex logic or heavy computations in DAG definitions.
*   **Optimize DAG Folder Structure:** Organize DAG files logically and minimize the number of files in the `dags_folder`.
*   **Manage Dependencies Carefully:** Use virtual environments or containerization to isolate dependencies and prevent conflicts.
*   **Monitor Resources:** Track CPU, memory, and disk usage for the scheduler process and database server.
*   **Implement Logging and Alerting:** Configure robust logging and alerting to catch scheduler problems early.
*   **Regularly Update Airflow:** Keep Airflow up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and performance improvements.
*   **Use a Consistent Naming Convention:** Use consistent naming conventions for DAGs, tasks, and variables. This makes it easier to understand and maintain your Airflow workflows.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting Airflow scheduler issues requires a systematic approach, combining careful log analysis, configuration verification, and resource monitoring. By understanding the scheduler's role, identifying common problems, and following the troubleshooting steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your Airflow workflows run smoothly and reliably. Remember to proactively monitor your scheduler and implement alerting to catch issues early and prevent disruptions to your data pipelines.
