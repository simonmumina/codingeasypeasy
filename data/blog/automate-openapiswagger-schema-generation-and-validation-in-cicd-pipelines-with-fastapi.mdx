# Automate OpenAPI/Swagger Schema Generation & Validation in CI/CD Pipelines with FastAPI

Maintaining accurate and up-to-date API documentation is crucial for any successful API project. Manually generating and verifying OpenAPI/Swagger schemas can be tedious and prone to errors. This blog post will guide you through automating the generation and validation of your OpenAPI/Swagger schemas directly within your CI/CD pipeline using FastAPI. By incorporating these steps, you can guarantee that your API documentation reflects the latest codebase changes, improve developer collaboration, and reduce the risk of inconsistencies.

## Why Automate OpenAPI/Swagger Schema Generation and Validation?

Here's why automating this process is essential:

- **Consistency:** Ensures the OpenAPI/Swagger schema is always consistent with the current state of your API code.
- **Reduced Errors:** Eliminates manual errors in schema creation and updates.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Provides reliable and up-to-date documentation for developers.
- **Early Error Detection:** Catches schema-related issues early in the development cycle, preventing deployment of faulty APIs.
- **Automated Documentation:** Automatically generates documentation as part of the build process.
- **Confidence in API Changes:** Provides assurance that changes to your API haven't inadvertently broken existing API contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, ensure you have the following:

- **FastAPI Project:** A working FastAPI project with API endpoints defined.
- **Python 3.7+:** Python version 3.7 or later installed.
- **Poetry or Pip:** A package manager for installing dependencies (Poetry is recommended for dependency management).
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** A CI/CD pipeline set up using a tool like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or Jenkins.
- **Understanding of OpenAPI/Swagger:** Basic familiarity with OpenAPI/Swagger specification.
- **A text editor, or IDE of your preference.**

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary dependencies using Poetry or Pip.

**Using Poetry:**

```bash
poetry add fastapi uvicorn pydantic python-multipart
poetry add --group dev httpx jsonschema
```

**Using Pip:**

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic python-multipart
pip install httpx jsonschema
```

**Explanation:**

- `fastapi`: The FastAPI framework itself.
- `uvicorn`: An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- `pydantic`: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. FastAPI relies heavily on Pydantic.
- `python-multipart`: Support for handling multipart form data.
- `httpx`: An HTTP client library (used for schema validation in tests). We install it as a dev dependency as it's primarily used in tests.
- `jsonschema`: A library for validating JSON documents against a JSON schema. We install it as a dev dependency as it's primarily used in tests.

## Step 2: Create a Simple FastAPI Application

Let's create a basic FastAPI application with a simple endpoint. Create a file named `main.py`:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(
    title="My Awesome API",
    description="A sample API for demonstration purposes.",
    version="1.0.0",
    openapi_url="/openapi.json", # Customize the OpenAPI endpoint if needed
)


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None  # Allow optional description
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None


@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str | None = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `FastAPI` and `BaseModel` from their respective libraries.
- We create a FastAPI instance and define title, description and version. The `openapi_url` argument specifies the endpoint where the OpenAPI schema will be served (defaults to `/openapi.json` if not specified).
- We define a `Pydantic` model named `Item` to define the structure of the data.
- We define two API endpoints:
  - `/items/` (POST): Accepts an `Item` object in the request body.
  - `/items/{item_id}` (GET): Accepts an `item_id` as path parameter and an optional query parameter `q`.

## Step 3: Access the OpenAPI/Swagger Schema

FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI/Swagger schema based on your defined routes, request/response models, and documentation. You can access the schema in two ways:

1.  **JSON Format:** By default, the schema is available at `/openapi.json`.
2.  **Swagger UI:** FastAPI provides a built-in Swagger UI at `/docs`. Access it by running your FastAPI application and navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser.
3.  **ReDoc:** You can also access ReDoc, another API documentation tool, at `/redoc`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

To run the FastAPI application, execute:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This command starts the Uvicorn server, hosting your FastAPI application. The `--reload` flag enables automatic reloading of the server whenever you make changes to the code.

## Step 4: Create a Script for Schema Generation

Let's create a Python script to programmatically fetch the OpenAPI schema from your FastAPI application. This script will be used in your CI/CD pipeline.

Create a file named `generate_openapi.py`:

```plaintext
import httpx
import json
import os

OPENAPI_URL = "http://localhost:8000/openapi.json"  # Adjust if needed
OUTPUT_FILE = "openapi.json"

async def fetch_openapi_schema(url: str) -> dict:
    """Fetches the OpenAPI schema from the specified URL."""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
        return response.json()


async def save_openapi_schema(schema: dict, filename: str):
    """Saves the OpenAPI schema to a file."""
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        json.dump(schema, f, indent=2)


async def main():
    """Fetches and saves the OpenAPI schema."""
    try:
        schema = await fetch_openapi_schema(OPENAPI_URL)
        save_openapi_schema(schema, OUTPUT_FILE)
        print(f"OpenAPI schema saved to {OUTPUT_FILE}")
    except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
        print(f"Error fetching OpenAPI schema: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Explanation:**

- The script uses the `httpx` library to make an asynchronous HTTP request to fetch the OpenAPI schema from `/openapi.json`.
- It then saves the schema as a JSON file (`openapi.json` by default).
- Error handling is included to catch potential issues during fetching and saving the schema.
- It uses `asyncio` to run the asynchronous functions.
- It defines `OPENAPI_URL` and `OUTPUT_FILE` variables for configuration. Remember to adjust `OPENAPI_URL` if you customized your endpoint.

Before running this script, you'll need to start your FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then, in a separate terminal, run the script:

```bash
python generate_openapi.py
```

This will create a file named `openapi.json` in your project directory containing the generated OpenAPI schema.

## Step 5: Create a Script for Schema Validation

Now, let's create another script to validate the generated OpenAPI schema against the OpenAPI specification. This script uses the `jsonschema` library.

Create a file named `validate_openapi.py`:

```plaintext
import json
from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError
import os

SCHEMA_FILE = "openapi.json"


def load_openapi_schema(filename: str) -> dict:
    """Loads the OpenAPI schema from a file."""
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)


def validate_schema(schema: dict):
    """Validates the OpenAPI schema against the OpenAPI specification."""
    try:
        # OpenAPI v3.1.0 meta-schema (you might need to adjust the version)
        with open("openapi_v3_1_0.json", "r") as f:  # Download from https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/schema/2021-06-20/schema.json
            openapi_schema = json.load(f)
        validate(instance=schema, schema=openapi_schema)
        print("OpenAPI schema validation successful!")
        return True
    except ValidationError as e:
        print(f"OpenAPI schema validation failed: {e}")
        return False
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: OpenAPI v3.1.0 schema file (openapi_v3_1_0.json) not found. Download it from https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/schema/2021-06-20/schema.json")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return False


def main():
    """Loads and validates the OpenAPI schema."""
    schema = load_openapi_schema(SCHEMA_FILE)
    if validate_schema(schema):
        exit(0)  # Success
    else:
        exit(1)  # Failure


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Important:**

- **Download the OpenAPI Schema:** This script requires the OpenAPI v3.1.0 meta-schema (or your target version). Download it from: [https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/schema/2021-06-20/schema.json](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/schema/2021-06-20/schema.json) and save it as `openapi_v3_1_0.json` (or adjust the filename in the script). Make sure this file is in the same directory as your `validate_openapi.py` script. If you are using OpenAPI 3.0.0, then download the correct schema for it, and reference that in the script.
- **Adjust OpenAPI version:** Change `openapi_v3_1_0.json` to your desired OpenAPI version.

**Explanation:**

- The script loads the generated `openapi.json` file.
- It loads the OpenAPI specification's meta-schema (the schema that defines what a valid OpenAPI schema looks like).
- It uses the `jsonschema` library to validate the generated schema against the meta-schema.
- It prints a success or failure message based on the validation result.
- It uses `exit(0)` and `exit(1)` to indicate success or failure, respectively, which is important for CI/CD pipelines.

Run the validation script:

```bash
python validate_openapi.py
```

## Step 6: Integrate into your CI/CD Pipeline (Example with GitHub Actions)

Now, let's integrate these scripts into your CI/CD pipeline. Here's an example using GitHub Actions.

Create a file named `.github/workflows/openapi-validation.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: OpenAPI Schema Validation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python 3.x
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install poetry
          poetry install --no-interaction --with dev

      - name: Start FastAPI App (background)
        run: |
          nohup uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
          sleep 5  # Give the app time to start

      - name: Generate OpenAPI Schema
        run: python generate_openapi.py

      - name: Validate OpenAPI Schema
        run: python validate_openapi.py

      - name: Stop FastAPI App
        if: always()
        run: pkill -f "uvicorn main:app"
```

**Explanation:**

- **`name`:** The name of the workflow.
- **`on`:** Triggers the workflow on push events to the `main` branch and pull requests targeting the `main` branch.
- **`jobs`:** Defines the jobs to run. We have a single job named `validate`.
- **`runs-on`:** Specifies the operating system for the job (Ubuntu in this case).
- **`steps`:** A sequence of steps to execute:
  - **`actions/checkout@v3`:** Checks out the repository code.
  - **`actions/setup-python@v3`:** Sets up Python.
  - **Install dependencies:** Installs Poetry, and then installs project dependencies (including development dependencies).
  - **Start FastAPI App (background):** Starts the FastAPI application in the background using `nohup` and `&`. It's crucial to run it in the background so that the workflow can continue. We use `--host 0.0.0.0` to make the app accessible within the GitHub Actions environment. A `sleep 5` command is added to give the app sufficient time to start up before the schema generation script runs.
  - **Generate OpenAPI Schema:** Executes the `generate_openapi.py` script.
  - **Validate OpenAPI Schema:** Executes the `validate_openapi.py` script. If this script returns a non-zero exit code (indicating failure), the workflow will fail.
  - **Stop FastAPI App:** Terminates the background FastAPI process. The `if: always()` condition ensures that this step always runs, even if previous steps fail. This prevents lingering processes.

**Important Considerations for CI/CD:**

- **Port and Host:** In the CI/CD environment, you'll need to specify the host and port when starting the FastAPI application. Using `--host 0.0.0.0` makes the application accessible within the CI/CD environment. Make sure the port you select (8000 in this example) is not already in use.
- **Background Process:** It is _crucial_ to start the FastAPI application in the background so that the workflow can continue.
- **Startup Time:** Give the FastAPI application enough time to start up before attempting to fetch the OpenAPI schema. A `sleep` command can be helpful for this.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure your scripts have robust error handling to catch issues during schema generation and validation.
- **Cleanup:** Always clean up any background processes after the validation is complete. The `pkill` command is used to terminate the FastAPI process. The `if: always()` conditional is useful for ensuring that the cleanup step runs even if other steps fail.
- **Caching:** You might want to cache your dependencies to speed up subsequent CI/CD runs.

## Step 7: Running the CI/CD Pipeline

Commit the `.github/workflows/openapi-validation.yml`, `generate_openapi.py`, and `validate_openapi.py` files, along with your FastAPI application code, to your GitHub repository. The workflow will automatically trigger on push events to the `main` branch and on pull requests.

You can monitor the progress of the workflow in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository. If the validation fails, the workflow will fail, and you'll see the error message from the `validate_openapi.py` script in the workflow logs.

## Benefits of this approach

- **Early detection of issues:** Any changes that break the OpenAPI schema will be caught early in the development process, before they make it to production.
- **Improved collaboration:** Developers can be confident that the API documentation is always up-to-date and accurate.
- **Reduced risk of errors:** Automating the process eliminates the risk of manual errors.
- **Higher quality API:** The resulting API will be more consistent, reliable, and easier to use.

## Further Enhancements

- **Schema Diffing:** Implement schema diffing to identify specific changes in the schema between different commits. This can help pinpoint exactly what caused the validation to fail. Libraries like `diff_match_patch` can be useful for this.
- **Custom Validation Rules:** Add custom validation rules to check for specific API design patterns or requirements. You can use Pydantic's `validator` feature to implement these custom rules.
- **Schema Versioning:** Implement a schema versioning strategy to manage changes to the API schema over time.
- **Integration with Documentation Tools:** Integrate the generated OpenAPI schema with your documentation tools to automatically update the API documentation. Tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc can be configured to load the schema from a URL or file.
- **Automated Publishing:** Automate the publishing of your API documentation to a dedicated documentation website.
- **Expand testing:** Integrate API testing with tools like `pytest` and `requests` to ensure your endpoints respond as defined in your OpenAPI definition.

## Conclusion
