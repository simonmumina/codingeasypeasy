# Chakra UI Progress Circle: A Comprehensive Guide with Code Examples

The Chakra UI Progress Circle component is a powerful and versatile way to visually represent the progress of a task, process, or loading state in your React applications.  It's a crucial UI element that enhances the user experience by providing clear feedback and keeping users informed. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the various features, customization options, and accessibility considerations for effectively using the Progress Circle in your Chakra UI projects.

## What is a Progress Circle?

A Progress Circle, also known as a circular progress bar, is a graphical representation of progress using a circular shape. It visually indicates how much of a process has been completed, usually depicted as a filled or highlighted portion of the circle. It's an intuitive and engaging way to convey progress information to the user.

## Why Use Chakra UI's Progress Circle?

Chakra UI offers a well-designed and easily customizable Progress Circle component with several advantages:

*   **Accessibility:** Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a positive experience for all users, including those with disabilities.
*   **Customization:**  Extensive options for styling, including color, size, thickness, and animations.
*   **Theming:** Seamless integration with Chakra UI's theming system for consistent styling across your application.
*   **Ease of Use:**  Simple and intuitive API for rapid implementation and integration.
*   **Consistency:** Adheres to Chakra UI's design principles, promoting a cohesive and professional look and feel.

## Getting Started with the Chakra UI Progress Circle

Before diving into the code, ensure you have Chakra UI installed in your React project. If not, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
# or
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
```

Now, let's explore the basic usage of the Progress Circle:

```jsx
import { Progress } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function BasicProgressCircle() {
  return (
    <Progress value={50} />
  );
}

export default BasicProgressCircle;
```

This simple example renders a Progress Circle that is 50% complete. The `value` prop determines the progress percentage.

## Customizing the Progress Circle

Chakra UI provides a wide range of props to customize the appearance and behavior of the Progress Circle:

*   **`value`**:  (Required) The current progress value (0-100).
*   **`colorScheme`**:  The color scheme to use (e.g., 'blue', 'green', 'red').
*   **`size`**:  The size of the circle (e.g., 'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg').
*   **`borderRadius`**:  Controls the rounding of the progress bar ends.
*   **`hasStripe`**:  Adds a stripe effect to the progress bar.
*   **`isAnimated`**:  Animates the progress bar.
*   **`trackColor`**:  The color of the track behind the progress bar.
*   **`color`**: overrides the color of the progress bar set by `colorScheme`.

Let's look at some examples:

### Changing the Color Scheme

```jsx
import { Progress } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function ColoredProgressCircle() {
  return (
    <>
      <Progress value={30} colorScheme="red" mb={4} />
      <Progress value={60} colorScheme="green" mb={4} />
      <Progress value={90} colorScheme="blue" />
    </>
  );
}

export default ColoredProgressCircle;
```

This code snippet renders three Progress Circles with different color schemes: red, green, and blue.  The `mb={4}` prop adds margin-bottom for better spacing.

### Adjusting the Size

```jsx
import { Progress } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function SizedProgressCircle() {
  return (
    <>
      <Progress value={25} size="xs" mb={4} />
      <Progress value={50} size="sm" mb={4} />
      <Progress value={75} size="md" mb={4} />
      <Progress value={100} size="lg" />
    </>
  );
}

export default SizedProgressCircle;
```

This example showcases Progress Circles with various sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg`.

### Adding Stripes and Animation

```jsx
import { Progress } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function AnimatedProgressCircle() {
  return (
    <Progress value={70} hasStripe isAnimated colorScheme="purple" />
  );
}

export default AnimatedProgressCircle;
```

This code demonstrates how to add a stripe effect and animation to the Progress Circle, using `hasStripe` and `isAnimated` props, respectively.

### Custom Track Color and Border Radius

```jsx
import { Progress } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function CustomProgressCircle() {
  return (
    <Progress
      value={80}
      colorScheme="orange"
      trackColor="gray.200"
      borderRadius="full"
    />
  );
}

export default CustomProgressCircle;
```

Here, we customize the track color (the background of the circle) and set a `borderRadius` to make the ends of the progress bar rounded.

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is paramount when developing user interfaces.  The Chakra UI Progress Circle is designed with accessibility in mind, but it's important to follow best practices:

*   **`aria-valuenow`**: The `value` prop automatically sets the `aria-valuenow` attribute, which is crucial for screen readers to understand the progress.
*   **Provide Context:** Clearly label the Progress Circle to explain what process it represents.  For example, "Downloading file..." or "Uploading image...".  Use visually hidden labels if the context is obvious.
*   **Consider `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax`**:  While Chakra UI handles `aria-valuenow`, ensure the overall context is clear about the minimum (0) and maximum (100) values being represented.
*   **Use Appropriate Colors:** Ensure sufficient contrast between the progress bar, track, and background to meet accessibility guidelines (WCAG).  Use tools like a contrast checker to verify.

Example with visually hidden label:

```jsx
import { Progress, VisuallyHidden } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function AccessibleProgressCircle() {
  return (
    <>
      <VisuallyHidden>Downloading file...</VisuallyHidden>
      <Progress value={45} colorScheme="teal" />
    </>
  );
}

export default AccessibleProgressCircle;
```

## Beyond the Basics: Advanced Usage

### Integrating with Real-Time Data

The true power of the Progress Circle lies in its ability to dynamically reflect real-time data. Here's an example of how you can integrate it with a state variable:

```jsx
import { Progress, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DynamicProgressCircle() {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setProgress((prevProgress) => {
        const newProgress = prevProgress + 10;
        return newProgress > 100 ? 100 : newProgress;
      });
    }, 500); // Update progress every 500ms

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId); // Clear interval on unmount
  }, []);

  return (
    <Box width="300px">
      <Progress value={progress} colorScheme="green" />
      <p>Progress: {progress}%</p>
    </Box>
  );
}

export default DynamicProgressCircle;
```

This code uses `useState` and `useEffect` to update the progress value every 500 milliseconds. The `setInterval` function simulates a task that progresses over time.  The `clearInterval` function in the `useEffect`'s cleanup function prevents memory leaks. The `Box` component is used to limit the width of the progress bar.

### Combining with Other Components

The Progress Circle can be seamlessly integrated with other Chakra UI components to create more complex and informative UI elements.  For example, you can combine it with text to display the current progress percentage:

```jsx
import { Progress, Text, Flex, Box } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function CombinedProgress() {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setProgress((prevProgress) => {
        const newProgress = prevProgress + 5;
        return newProgress > 100 ? 100 : newProgress;
      });
    }, 300);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Box width="300px">
        <Flex align="center">
          <Text mr={2}>{progress}%</Text>
          <Progress value={progress} flex="1" colorScheme="purple" />
        </Flex>
      </Box>
  );
}

export default CombinedProgress;
```

This example uses a `Flex` container to align the percentage text and the Progress Circle horizontally. The `flex="1"` prop on the `Progress` component makes it expand to fill the available space.

### Using a Theme

The real power of Chakra UI comes from being able to theme your entire application. You can customize the default color scheme used by the `Progress` component in your `theme.js` or `theme.ts` file.

```javascript
// theme.js or theme.ts
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    Progress: {
      baseStyle: {
        filledTrack: {
          bg: 'teal.500', // Default color for all Progress components
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

By extending the theme, you can customize the default styles for the Progress Circle across your entire application, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Appropriately:** Progress Circles are best suited for tasks with a known duration and a clear progress indicator. For indeterminate tasks (e.g., waiting for a server response), consider using a loading spinner instead.
*   **Provide Context:** Always provide clear context about what the Progress Circle represents.
*   **Keep it Updated:** Ensure the Progress Circle accurately reflects the progress of the task.
*   **Consider Performance:** Avoid unnecessary re-renders of the Progress Circle component, especially when dealing with frequently updated data.  Use `useMemo` or `React.memo` if necessary.
*   **Test on different Browsers and Devices:**  Ensure your customized progress circle looks and works as intended across all supported environments.

## Conclusion

The Chakra UI Progress Circle component is a versatile and accessible way to display progress in your React applications. By understanding its various customization options and accessibility considerations, you can create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that provide valuable feedback to your users.  Remember to always prioritize accessibility and provide clear context to ensure a positive user experience for everyone.  Experiment with different styles and integrations to find the best way to represent progress in your specific application.
