# Mastering Presence in Chakra UI: Advanced Techniques and Best Practices

Chakra UI is a fantastic component library for React, known for its accessibility, ease of use, and theming capabilities. One of its often-overlooked but incredibly powerful features is the `Presence` component. This component allows you to animate the mounting and unmounting of React elements, enhancing the user experience and creating a more polished and engaging application. This comprehensive guide delves into the `Presence` component, exploring its capabilities, advanced techniques, and best practices.

## What is the `Presence` Component in Chakra UI?

The `Presence` component in Chakra UI is a wrapper that intelligently handles the animation of components when they enter and exit the DOM. It leverages the power of React's reconciliation process to detect when a component is being removed and seamlessly animate it out before it's fully unmounted. This prevents abrupt changes in the UI, resulting in smoother transitions and a more visually appealing application.

## Basic Usage: Adding Enter and Exit Animations

The simplest use case for the `Presence` component involves wrapping a component that needs to be animated during mount and unmount. You'll typically use it in conjunction with state management to control when the component is displayed or hidden.

```plaintext
import { Box, Button, useDisclosure, Fade } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion';

function BasicPresenceExample() {
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure();

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={onToggle}>Toggle Box</Button>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOpen && (
          <motion.div
            key="unique-id" // Required for AnimatePresence to track components
            initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
            transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
          >
            <Box
              bg="teal.500"
              color="white"
              p={4}
              borderRadius="md"
              mt={4}
            >
              This box will fade in and out!
            </Box>
          </motion.div>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>
  );
}

export default BasicPresenceExample;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`useDisclosure`:** This hook from Chakra UI manages the `isOpen` state, determining whether the box is visible.
- **`AnimatePresence`:** This component, from Framer Motion which Chakra UI utilizes, wraps the conditional rendering of the `Box`. Crucially, it _must_ wrap the element being animated.
- **`motion.div`:** We use the `motion` component from `framer-motion` to enable animations. This is essential; standard Chakra UI components will not inherently animate with `AnimatePresence`. The `motion` prefix tells Framer Motion to track and animate this element.
- **`key`:** A unique `key` prop is _required_ within the `motion.div` for `AnimatePresence` to properly track the component's presence in the DOM. Without a key, it won't be able to detect changes and apply animations correctly. Use a dynamically generated or stable unique ID.
- **`initial`:** Defines the initial state of the component before it enters the DOM. Here, it starts with zero opacity and slightly above its final position.
- **`animate`:** Defines the target state of the component when it's mounted. Here, it fades in and moves to its final position.
- **`exit`:** Defines the state of the component as it's being unmounted. Here, it fades out and moves back up.
- **`transition`:** Controls the duration and easing of the animation.

## Advanced Techniques and Customization

The `Presence` component's real power lies in its flexibility and the ability to customize the animations. Here are some advanced techniques:

### 1. Staggered Animations

Staggered animations are perfect for creating visually appealing list transitions. They create a cascade effect where each item animates in or out slightly after the previous one.

```plaintext
import { Box, Button, List, ListItem, useDisclosure } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion';

const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];

function StaggeredPresenceExample() {
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure();

  const listVariants = {
    visible: {
      transition: { staggerChildren: 0.07, delayChildren: 0.2 },
    },
    hidden: {
      transition: { staggerChildren: 0.05, staggerDirection: -1 },
    },
  };

  const itemVariants = {
    visible: {
      opacity: 1,
      y: 0,
      transition: {
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 260,
        damping: 20,
      },
    },
    hidden: {
      opacity: 0,
      y: -50,
      transition: {
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 260,
        damping: 20,
      },
    },
  };


  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={onToggle}>Toggle List</Button>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOpen && (
          <motion.List
            variants={listVariants}
            initial="hidden"
            animate="visible"
            exit="hidden"
            style={{ listStyleType: 'none', padding: 0 }}
          >
            {items.map((item, index) => (
              <motion.ListItem
                key={item}
                variants={itemVariants}
                whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }} //Optional: Hover effect
                whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}   //Optional: Tap effect
                style={{ padding: '10px', borderBottom: '1px solid #ccc' }}
              >
                {item}
              </motion.ListItem>
            ))}
          </motion.List>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>
  );
}

export default StaggeredPresenceExample;
```

**Key Points:**

- **`listVariants` and `itemVariants`:** We define variants for the list and list items to control the animation.
- **`staggerChildren`:** The `staggerChildren` property in the `listVariants` determines the delay between each child's animation. A positive value animates from top to bottom, while a negative value animates from bottom to top.
- **`initial`, `animate`, `exit`:** These props apply the defined variants to the list.
- **`whileHover` and `whileTap`:** These optional props from Framer Motion add interactive hover and tap effects for enhanced UX.
- **Spring Animations:** Using `type: "spring"` for more natural-looking, bouncy animations. Adjust `stiffness` and `damping` for different spring effects.

### 2. Custom Transitions

You can fine-tune the animation using custom transition properties. This allows you to control the easing function, duration, and delay.

```plaintext
import { Box, Button, useDisclosure } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion';

function CustomTransitionExample() {
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure();

  const variants = {
    initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.5 },
    animate: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 },
    exit: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.5 },
  };

  const transition = {
    type: "spring",
    stiffness: 100,
    damping: 20,
    duration: 0.5, // Overrides Spring Type's auto duration
  };


  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={onToggle}>Toggle Box</Button>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOpen && (
          <motion.div
            key="unique-id"
            variants={variants}
            initial="initial"
            animate="animate"
            exit="exit"
            transition={transition}
            style={{
              width: '200px',
              height: '100px',
              backgroundColor: 'purple',
              color: 'white',
              display: 'flex',
              justifyContent: 'center',
              alignItems: 'center',
              borderRadius: 'md',
            }}
          >
            Custom Transition!
          </motion.div>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>
  );
}

export default CustomTransitionExample;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`transition` object:** This object allows precise control over the animation.
- **`type: "spring"`:** Specifies a spring-based animation.
- **`stiffness` and `damping`:** These properties control the behavior of the spring. Higher stiffness values result in a faster, more rigid spring, while higher damping values reduce the oscillation.
- **`duration`:** Directly sets the animation duration, overriding the automatically calculated duration from spring physics.

### 3. Conditional Animations

Sometimes, you might need different animations based on specific conditions. You can achieve this by using conditional logic within your animation variants.

```plaintext
import { Box, Button, useDisclosure } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { useState } from 'react';

function ConditionalAnimationExample() {
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure();
  const [direction, setDirection] = useState('left'); // 'left' or 'right'

  const handleClick = () => {
    onToggle();
    setDirection(direction === 'left' ? 'right' : 'left');
  };


  const variants = {
    initial: { x: direction === 'left' ? -100 : 100, opacity: 0 },
    animate: { x: 0, opacity: 1 },
    exit: { x: direction === 'left' ? 100 : -100, opacity: 0 },
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={handleClick}>Toggle Box (Directional)</Button>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOpen && (
          <motion.div
            key="unique-id"
            variants={variants}
            initial="initial"
            animate="animate"
            exit="exit"
            transition={{ duration: 0.5, ease: "easeInOut" }}
            style={{
              width: '200px',
              height: '100px',
              backgroundColor: 'blue',
              color: 'white',
              display: 'flex',
              justifyContent: 'center',
              alignItems: 'center',
              borderRadius: 'md',
            }}
          >
            Directional Animation
          </motion.div>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>
  );
}

export default ConditionalAnimationExample;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`direction` state:** This state tracks the direction of the animation (left or right).
- **Conditional logic in `variants`:** The `x` property in the `initial` and `exit` states is dynamically set based on the `direction` state. This makes the box slide in and out from the left or right.

### 4. Using Exit Before Enter for Overlapping Animations (mode="wait")

By default, `AnimatePresence` attempts to animate exiting and entering components concurrently. This is often what you want, but sometimes you might want the exiting component to fully animate out _before_ the entering component starts animating in. This is useful for scenarios where you want to avoid visual overlapping or glitches.

```plaintext
import { Box, Button, useDisclosure } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { useState } from 'react';

const modes = ['sync', 'wait']

function ExitBeforeEnterExample() {
  const [showFirst, setShowFirst] = useState(true);
  const [modeIndex, setModeIndex] = useState(0);
  const mode = modes[modeIndex];

  const toggleComponent = () => setShowFirst(!showFirst);

  const nextMode = () => setModeIndex((modeIndex + 1) % modes.length);

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={toggleComponent} mr={4}>Toggle Components</Button>
      <Button onClick={nextMode}>Mode: {mode}</Button>
      <AnimatePresence mode={mode}>
        {showFirst ? (
          <motion.div
            key="first"
            initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -100 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 100 }}
            transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
            style={{
              width: '200px',
              height: '100px',
              backgroundColor: 'red',
              color: 'white',
              display: 'flex',
              justifyContent: 'center',
              alignItems: 'center',
              borderRadius: 'md',
              marginTop: '10px',
            }}
          >
            Component A
          </motion.div>
        ) : (
          <motion.div
            key="second"
            initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -100 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0, x: 100 }}
            transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
            style={{
              width: '200px',
              height: '100px',
              backgroundColor: 'green',
              color: 'white',
              display: 'flex',
              justifyContent: 'center',
              alignItems: 'center',
              borderRadius: 'md',
              marginTop: '10px',
            }}
          >
            Component B
          </motion.div>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>
  );
}

export default ExitBeforeEnterExample;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`mode="wait"`:** By setting the `mode` prop of `AnimatePresence` to `"wait"`, we ensure that the exit animation completes before the enter animation begins.
- **Key management:** Each component must have a unique `key` prop so `AnimatePresence` can track them.

## Best Practices for Using the `Presence` Component

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using the `Presence` component:

- **Unique Keys:** Always provide a unique `key` prop to the animated component. This is crucial for the `Presence` component to track the component's presence in the DOM correctly. Use stable and meaningful keys.
- **Performance:** Be mindful of the performance impact of animations. Complex animations can negatively impact performance, especially on low-powered devices. Optimize your animations by using hardware acceleration (e.g., `translate3d` or `will-change`) and avoiding unnecessary calculations.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure your animations are accessible to all users. Avoid using animations that could trigger seizures or cause discomfort for users with vestibular disorders. Provide options to disable animations for users who prefer static content. Follow accessibility guidelines like WCAG.
- **Meaningful Animations:** Use animations thoughtfully and intentionally. Animations should enhance the user experience, not distract from it. Avoid using animations for purely decorative purposes.
- **Framer Motion Integration:** Remember that the `Presence` component works seamlessly with Framer Motion. Leverage Framer Motion's powerful features for creating complex and engaging animations.
- \*\*`mode="wait"` vs `mode="sync"`: Consider the appropriate `mode` for your animation needs. `"sync"` (the default) allows concurrent enter and exit animations, which is often preferred for speed and fluidity. `"wait"` ensures the exit animation completes before the enter animation begins, which is useful for avoiding overlap.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Animation Not Working:** Ensure that you're using `motion` components from `framer-motion` inside `AnimatePresence` and that you've provided a unique `key` prop. Also, double-check your `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` states.
- **Overlapping Animations:** If you're experiencing overlapping animations when components are being added and removed simultaneously, consider using `mode="wait"` in the `AnimatePresence` component.
- **Performance Problems:** Reduce the complexity of your animations, use hardware acceleration, and profile your application to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

The `Presence` component in Chakra UI, combined with Framer Motion, is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing and engaging React applications. By understanding its capabilities and following best practices, you can use it to enhance the user experience and create a more polished and professional-looking application. Experiment with different animation techniques and customize the animations to match your brand and design aesthetic. Remember to prioritize accessibility and performance to ensure that your animations are enjoyable and usable for all users. By mastering these advanced techniques, you'll be able to leverage the full potential of the Chakra UI `Presence` component and create truly exceptional user interfaces.
