# Gatsby Accessibility Testing: Integrate Automated Checks into Your Build Process

Creating accessible websites isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a crucial part of building inclusive and user-friendly experiences. For Gatsby developers, proactively testing for accessibility issues during the build process is the most effective way to ensure your site meets accessibility standards and provides a positive experience for all users. This post will guide you through several methods to integrate automated accessibility checks into your Gatsby workflow, using tools like Axe, ESLint with a11y plugins, and Jest.

## Why Accessibility Testing During Builds?

Testing for accessibility early in the development lifecycle offers significant advantages:

- **Catch Issues Early:** Identifying and fixing accessibility problems during development is significantly cheaper and easier than retrofitting accessibility after launch.
- **Prevent Regressions:** Automated tests ensure that new features or changes don't introduce new accessibility barriers.
- **Enforce Standards:** Integrate accessibility best practices into your development workflow, encouraging developers to build accessibly from the start.
- **Improve User Experience:** Accessibility improvements often lead to better usability for _all_ users, regardless of disability.
- **Reduce Legal Risk:** Many countries have accessibility laws (like the ADA in the US) that require websites to be accessible. Proactive testing helps ensure compliance.

## Tools We'll Use

- **Axe (Deque Systems):** A powerful accessibility testing engine that automates the detection of common accessibility issues. We'll primarily use the Axe Chrome extension initially, and then integrate it into our CI/CD pipeline.
- **ESLint with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`:** ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter, and `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` adds accessibility-specific linting rules to your JSX code.
- **Jest (or another testing framework):** We'll use Jest (a popular testing framework) to write unit and integration tests that include accessibility checks, often using Axe to perform the actual accessibility assertions.

## 1. Setting Up ESLint with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`

ESLint helps enforce consistent coding style and can catch potential errors _before_ your code even runs. The `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` plugin adds accessibility-specific rules to your ESLint configuration.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install eslint eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y --save-dev
```

**Configuration (.eslintrc.js):**

Create or modify your `.eslintrc.js` file to include the `jsx-a11y` plugin and configure the desired rules. Here's a basic example:

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended'],
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaFeatures: {
      jsx: true,
    },
    ecmaVersion: 2018,
    sourceType: 'module',
  },
  plugins: ['jsx-a11y'],
  rules: {
    // Customize rules here (optional)
    'jsx-a11y/alt-text': 'warn', // Warn about missing alt text on images
    'jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid': 'warn', // Warn about invalid <a> tag usage
    'jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control': 'warn', // Warn about missing label associations
  },
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"]`: Extends the recommended ESLint rules and the recommended accessibility rules from `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`.
- `"plugins": ["jsx-a11y"]`: Registers the `jsx-a11y` plugin.
- `"rules": { ... }`: Allows you to customize individual rules. `"warn"` indicates that violations will be reported as warnings, not errors (you can use `"error"` to treat them as errors, which will break your build).

**Example Usage in a Component:**

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="/my-image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" />
      <a href="#">Click Here</a>
      <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" />
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

If you were to remove the `alt` attribute from the `img` tag, ESLint (with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`) would report a warning.

**Integrating into Your Build Process:**

Most Gatsby starter projects will already have ESLint configured. You can run ESLint from the command line using `eslint .` (from the root of your project). Many IDEs also have ESLint integrations that will show you warnings and errors directly in your editor.

To make ESLint part of your build process, you can add an ESLint command to your `package.json`'s `scripts` section:

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}
```

Then, in your CI/CD pipeline (or a pre-commit hook), you can run `npm run lint` to check for ESLint errors.

## 2. Using Jest and Axe for Automated Testing

Jest allows you to write unit and integration tests for your React components. We'll use the `axe-core` library, along with a Jest testing library, to perform accessibility assertions within our tests.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom axe-core jest-axe --save-dev
```

**Explanation:**

- `jest`: The Jest testing framework.
- `@testing-library/react`: Provides utilities for rendering and interacting with React components in tests.
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Adds custom Jest matchers for asserting on DOM elements.
- `axe-core`: The Axe accessibility testing engine.
- `jest-axe`: Provides convenient Jest matchers for using Axe.

**Configuration (jest.config.js):**

Create or modify your `jest.config.js` file to configure Jest. You'll likely want to include a setup file that imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` to add its matchers.

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js'], // Or wherever you put your setup file
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.jsx?$': 'babel-jest',
    '^.+\\.mdx?$': '@mdx-js/jest', // if you are testing MDX content
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$': 'identity-obj-proxy', // Mock CSS imports
  },
}
```

**Create a `src/setupTests.js` file:**

```plaintext
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'
import { toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)
```

This imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` and extends the `expect` object with the `toHaveNoViolations` matcher from `jest-axe`.

**Example Test:**

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render } from '@testing-library/react'
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'
import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent' // Adjust path as needed

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should have no accessibility violations', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<MyComponent />)
    const results = await axe(container)

    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `render(<MyComponent />)`: Renders the `MyComponent` using `@testing-library/react`.
- `axe(container)`: Runs Axe against the rendered component's container.
- `expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()`: Asserts that the Axe results contain no accessibility violations. This is where `jest-axe` comes in.

**Example Component (MyComponent.jsx):**

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <img src="/image.jpg" alt="Description of the world" />
      <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Running Tests:**

Run your tests using `npm test` (assuming you have a `test` script in your `package.json` that runs Jest).

**Customizing Axe:**

You can customize Axe's configuration to ignore specific rules or elements:

```plaintext
it('should have no accessibility violations (with custom config)', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<MyComponent />)
  const results = await axe(container, {
    rules: {
      'color-contrast': { enabled: false }, // Ignore color contrast issues
    },
  })

  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

**Ignoring Elements with `data-axe-exclude`:**

You can exclude specific elements from Axe checks by adding the `data-axe-exclude="true"` attribute:

```jsx
<div data-axe-exclude="true">This element will be ignored by Axe.</div>
```

**Integrating into Your Build Process:**

Add a test script to your `package.json`:

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Then, in your CI/CD pipeline (or a pre-commit hook), you can run `npm test` to check for accessibility violations. If any tests fail due to accessibility issues, your build will fail.

## 3. Integrate Accessibility Checks into Your CI/CD Pipeline

The real power of accessibility testing comes from automating it as part of your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that every code change is checked for accessibility regressions.

Here's a basic example using GitHub Actions:

```plaintext
name: Accessibility Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # Or your main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  accessibility:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18 # Or your Node.js version
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Run Jest tests
        run: npm test
```

**Explanation:**

- `on: [push, pull_request]`: Triggers the workflow on pushes to the `main` branch and on pull requests targeting the `main` branch.
- `steps`: Defines the steps of the workflow.
  - `actions/checkout@v3`: Checks out the code.
  - `actions/setup-node@v3`: Sets up Node.js.
  - `npm install`: Installs dependencies.
  - `npm run lint`: Runs the ESLint command.
  - `npm test`: Runs the Jest tests.

If either `npm run lint` or `npm test` fails (due to accessibility violations or other errors), the GitHub Actions workflow will fail, preventing the code from being merged.

## 4. Axe Chrome Extension for Manual Testing

While automated testing is crucial, manual testing with the Axe Chrome extension is also important for catching issues that are difficult to automate.

**Installation:**

1.  Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for "Axe - Web Accessibility Testing".
2.  Install the extension.

**Usage:**

1.  Open the page you want to test in Chrome.
2.  Open the Chrome DevTools (right-click and select "Inspect").
3.  Click on the "Axe" tab.
4.  Click the "Analyze" button.

Axe will scan the page and report any accessibility violations it finds. It provides detailed information about each violation, including the element involved, the rule that was violated, and suggested solutions.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Start Early and Test Often:** Integrate accessibility testing into your development workflow from the beginning of the project.
- **Use a Combination of Tools:** Combine ESLint, Jest, and manual testing to catch a wide range of accessibility issues.
- **Educate Your Team:** Ensure that all developers understand accessibility best practices and how to use the testing tools.
- **Prioritize Issues:** Not all accessibility issues are created equal. Focus on fixing the most critical issues first.
- **Use a Design System:** A well-designed and accessible design system can significantly reduce the risk of introducing accessibility issues.
- **Regularly Review and Update Your Testing Configuration:** Accessibility standards and best practices evolve over time, so it's important to regularly review and update your testing configuration.
- **Don't Rely Solely on Automated Tests:** While automated testing is extremely useful, it cannot catch all accessibility issues. Manual testing with assistive technologies (like screen readers) is still essential.

## Conclusion

Integrating accessibility testing into your Gatsby build process is essential for creating inclusive and user-friendly websites. By using tools like Axe, ESLint, and Jest, you can catch accessibility issues early and often, prevent regressions, and enforce accessibility standards. Remember to supplement automated testing with manual testing and ongoing education to ensure that your website is accessible to everyone. Start small, iterate, and make accessibility a core part of your development culture.
