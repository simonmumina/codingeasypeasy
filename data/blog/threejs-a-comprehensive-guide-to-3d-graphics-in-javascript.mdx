# Three.js: A Comprehensive Guide to 3D Graphics in JavaScript

Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to create stunning 3D graphics in your web browser without relying on plugins. Built on top of WebGL, it simplifies the complex task of rendering 3D scenes, enabling developers to easily create immersive and interactive experiences. Whether you're building games, visualizations, or engaging web interfaces, Three.js provides the tools you need.

## Why Choose Three.js?

- **Abstraction:** Three.js abstracts away the complexities of WebGL, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of 3D development rather than low-level graphics programming.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** It provides excellent cross-browser compatibility, ensuring your 3D applications run smoothly on various platforms.
- **Large Community & Extensive Documentation:** A vibrant community and comprehensive documentation make learning and troubleshooting easier. There are countless examples, tutorials, and resources available online.
- **Rich Feature Set:** Three.js offers a wide range of features, including support for various geometries, materials, lighting models, animations, and post-processing effects.
- **Performance:** Optimized for performance, Three.js allows you to create complex 3D scenes without sacrificing frame rates.

## Getting Started with Three.js

### 1. Setting up your Environment

The easiest way to get started with Three.js is to include it directly from a CDN (Content Delivery Network):

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Three.js Scene</title>
    <style>
        body { margin: 0; }
        canvas { display: block; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.158.0/build/three.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        // Our Three.js code will go here
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Alternatively, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install three
# or
yarn add three
```

And then import it into your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
```

### 2. Creating a Basic Scene

A Three.js scene consists of three fundamental elements:

- **Scene:** The container for all objects, lights, and cameras in your 3D world.
- **Camera:** Defines the viewpoint from which the scene is rendered.
- **Renderer:** Renders the scene based on the camera's perspective.

Here's a basic example:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// 1. Create a scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene()

// 2. Create a camera (PerspectiveCamera is a common choice)
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000)
camera.position.z = 5 // Move the camera back

// 3. Create a renderer (WebGLRenderer is the most common)
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer()
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement)

// Animation loop (renders the scene repeatedly)
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate)
  renderer.render(scene, camera)
}
animate()
```

This code sets up the basic infrastructure, but the scene is currently empty. You'll only see a black screen.

### 3. Adding Objects to the Scene

To make something visible, we need to add objects to the scene. Let's create a simple cube (a box geometry) with a basic material:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// ... (Scene, Camera, Renderer setup from previous example) ...

// 4. Create a Geometry (shape)
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1) // Width, Height, Depth

// 5. Create a Material (appearance)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 }) // Green color

// 6. Create a Mesh (combines geometry and material)
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)

// 7. Add the mesh to the scene
scene.add(cube)

// ... (Animation loop) ...
```

Now you should see a green cube rendered on the screen.

### 4. Understanding Geometries and Materials

- **Geometries:** Define the shape of your 3D objects. Three.js offers a variety of built-in geometries, including:

  - `BoxGeometry`: A cube or rectangular prism.
  - `SphereGeometry`: A sphere.
  - `PlaneGeometry`: A flat plane.
  - `CylinderGeometry`: A cylinder.
  - `TorusGeometry`: A donut shape.
  - `ConeGeometry`: A cone.
  - `TetrahedronGeometry`, `OctahedronGeometry`, `IcosahedronGeometry`, `DodecahedronGeometry`: Platonic solids.
  - `BufferGeometry`: A more advanced geometry that allows you to define vertices directly for maximum flexibility.

- **Materials:** Define the surface properties of your 3D objects, such as color, texture, and shininess. Some common materials include:
  - `MeshBasicMaterial`: A simple, unlit material that displays a solid color or texture.
  - `MeshLambertMaterial`: A material that reacts to light using the Lambertian reflectance model (diffuse lighting).
  - `MeshPhongMaterial`: A material that reacts to light with specular highlights (shiny reflections).
  - `MeshStandardMaterial`: A physically based rendering (PBR) material that provides more realistic lighting and shading.
  - `MeshPhysicalMaterial`: Another PBR material, extending `MeshStandardMaterial` with support for clearcoat and sheen.
  - `ShaderMaterial`: A powerful material that allows you to write custom shaders for advanced rendering effects.
  - `PointsMaterial`: Used for rendering particle systems.
  - `LineBasicMaterial`: Used for rendering lines.
  - `LineDashedMaterial`: Used for rendering dashed lines.

### 5. Adding Lighting

Without lighting, your scene will appear flat and uninteresting, especially when using materials like `MeshLambertMaterial` or `MeshPhongMaterial`. Here's how to add lighting:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// ... (Scene, Camera, Renderer, Geometry, and Material setup from previous example) ...

// Change material to MeshLambertMaterial to see lighting effect
const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 })
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add(cube)

// 8. Add a light source (AmbientLight for general illumination)
const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040) // Soft white light
scene.add(ambientLight)

// 9. Add a DirectionalLight (directional light source with shadows)
const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1) // White light, intensity 1
directionalLight.position.set(0, 1, 1).normalize() // Point from above and slightly to the side
scene.add(directionalLight)

// ... (Animation loop) ...
```

You should now see the cube with shading and highlights. Experiment with different light types (e.g., `PointLight`, `SpotLight`) and their parameters. Remember to adjust the position of the light source to affect the shadows and highlights.

**Enabling Shadows:**

To enable shadows, you'll need to configure the renderer and the light source:

```javascript
// Enable shadows in the renderer
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true
renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap // Optional, for smoother shadows

// Enable shadows on the light source
directionalLight.castShadow = true

// Define shadow map resolution (optional, but important for quality)
directionalLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 512 // default
directionalLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 512 // default
directionalLight.shadow.camera.near = 0.5 // default
directionalLight.shadow.camera.far = 500 // default

// Make the cube cast a shadow
cube.castShadow = true

// You also need a plane to receive the shadow
const planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(20, 20, 32, 32)
const planeMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x808080, side: THREE.DoubleSide })
const plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeometry, planeMaterial)
plane.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2 // Rotate to be horizontal
plane.receiveShadow = true // Allow the plane to receive shadows
scene.add(plane)

// Adjust the light position so it actually casts a shadow
directionalLight.position.set(2, 5, 3)
```

### 6. Animation

Animating your scene adds interactivity and dynamism. The `animate` function in the previous examples is the animation loop. Inside this loop, you can modify the properties of your objects to create movement:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// ... (Scene, Camera, Renderer, Geometry, Material, Cube setup from previous examples) ...

// Modify the animation loop
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate)

  // Rotate the cube
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01

  renderer.render(scene, camera)
}
animate()
```

This code rotates the cube around its X and Y axes each frame, creating a continuous spinning effect.

### 7. Camera Controls (OrbitControls)

OrbitControls allow you to rotate, pan, and zoom the camera around the scene using the mouse. To use OrbitControls, you need to include it from the `three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls` directory (if using npm installation) or import the appropriate module if using a bundler.

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls' // If using npm or similar.  If not, look at the threejs examples folder directly and copy into your project

// ... (Scene, Camera, Renderer, Geometry, Material, Cube setup from previous examples) ...

// Create OrbitControls
const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement)
controls.enableDamping = true // an animation loop is required when either damping or auto-rotation are enabled
controls.dampingFactor = 0.05
controls.screenSpacePanning = false
controls.minDistance = 1
controls.maxDistance = 10

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate)
  controls.update() // Important for OrbitControls to work!
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01
  renderer.render(scene, camera)
}

animate()
```

Now you can use your mouse to interact with the scene. Remember to call `controls.update()` in your animation loop.

### 8. Textures

Textures add detail and realism to your 3D models. You can load textures from image files using the `TextureLoader`:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'

// ... (Scene, Camera, Renderer setup) ...

const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader()
const texture = textureLoader.load('path/to/your/texture.jpg')

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture }) // Use the loaded texture
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add(cube)

// ... (Animation loop) ...
```

Replace `'path/to/your/texture.jpg'` with the actual path to your image file.

### 9. Models (Loading glTF/glb Models)

Three.js can load models from various formats, including glTF (GL Transmission Format), which is a popular format for 3D models on the web. Use the `GLTFLoader` to load glTF models:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three'
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader' // As with OrbitControls, include this from the examples folder

// ... (Scene, Camera, Renderer setup) ...

const loader = new GLTFLoader()

loader.load(
  'path/to/your/model.glb',
  function (gltf) {
    scene.add(gltf.scene)
  },
  undefined,
  function (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
)

// ... (Animation loop) ...
```

Replace `'path/to/your/model.glb'` with the path to your glTF/glb file. You might need to adjust the model's scale, position, and rotation after loading it into the scene. Consider using a loading manager to track the progress of the model loading.

### 10. Optimizing Performance

As your scenes become more complex, performance can become a concern. Here are some tips for optimizing your Three.js applications:

- **Reduce Polygon Count:** Use simpler geometries or decimate existing models to reduce the number of polygons rendered.
- **Texture Optimization:** Use compressed texture formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and minimize texture resolution. Use texture atlases to combine multiple textures into a single image. Consider using mipmapping.
- **Instancing:** If you're rendering many copies of the same object, use instancing to render them efficiently.
- **Frustum Culling:** Ensure that only objects visible in the camera's view frustum are rendered.
- **Level of Detail (LOD):** Use different levels of detail for objects based on their distance from the camera.
- **Shadow Optimization:** Reduce the shadow map resolution or disable shadows altogether.
- **Garbage Collection:** Avoid creating unnecessary objects in your animation loop to minimize garbage collection overhead.
- **Profiling:** Use the browser's developer tools to profile your application and identify performance bottlenecks.
