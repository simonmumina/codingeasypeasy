# Expo Manifest: Deep Dive into App Configuration and Deployment

Building robust and maintainable React Native apps with Expo requires a solid understanding of the Expo manifest, specifically the `app.json` and `app.config.js` files. These files are the heart of your app's configuration, dictating everything from the app name and version to native module dependencies and deployment settings. This guide provides a comprehensive exploration of Expo manifests, enabling you to optimize your app development workflow and streamline deployments.

## What is an Expo Manifest?

The Expo manifest is a JSON object (defined in `app.json` or `app.config.js`) that describes your Expo project. It acts as a central source of truth for configuration information. It is used by the Expo CLI, Expo Go app, and build services to:

- Configure your app's metadata (name, version, bundle identifier, etc.).
- Specify native dependencies.
- Configure update channels.
- Define environment variables.
- Customize native platform builds (iOS and Android).

Essentially, the manifest is the bridge between your JavaScript/TypeScript code and the native platforms it runs on. Changes to the manifest require a new build (or update depending on configuration) to be reflected in your app.

## `app.json` vs. `app.config.js`: Choosing the Right Approach

Expo offers two ways to define your app manifest:

- **`app.json`:** A simple JSON file suitable for static configurations. Easy to understand and use for basic app setups.

- **`app.config.js` (or `app.config.ts`):** A JavaScript/TypeScript file that allows for dynamic and programmatic configuration. Enables the use of environment variables, conditional logic, and complex data structures. This is the recommended approach for most projects.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature               | `app.json`               | `app.config.js` (or `app.config.ts`) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| File Type             | JSON                     | JavaScript/TypeScript                |
| Dynamic Configuration | No                       | Yes                                  |
| Environment Variables | Limited (requires tools) | Fully supported                      |
| Conditional Logic     | No                       | Yes                                  |
| Code Execution        | No                       | Yes                                  |

**When to use `app.json`:**

- Simple app configuration with minimal dynamic requirements.
- Small projects where complex logic is unnecessary.
- When a purely declarative approach is preferred.

**When to use `app.config.js` (or `app.config.ts`):**

- Utilizing environment variables for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Implementing conditional logic to configure settings based on build targets or environment.
- Generating configurations dynamically from external data sources.
- Any project that requires flexible and programmatic configuration.

**Example: `app.json`**

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My Awesome App",
    "slug": "my-awesome-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "updates": {
      "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": ["**/*"],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF"
      },
      "package": "com.example.myapp"
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: `app.config.js`**

```plaintext
import 'dotenv/config' // Load environment variables

export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    name: process.env.APP_NAME || 'My Default App',
    slug: 'my-configurable-app',
    version: '1.0.0',
    extra: {
      apiUrl: process.env.API_URL,
    },
    ios: {
      bundleIdentifier: process.env.IOS_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER || 'com.example.defaultapp',
    },
    android: {
      package: process.env.ANDROID_PACKAGE || 'com.example.defaultapp',
    },
  }
}
```

In this example, `app.config.js` loads environment variables using `dotenv` and uses them to dynamically set the app name, API URL, and bundle/package identifiers. If the environment variables are not defined, default values are used. This allows for different configurations for different environments without modifying the code.

## Key Configuration Options in the Expo Manifest

The `expo` object in your manifest contains a wealth of configuration options. Here are some of the most important ones:

- **`name`:** The human-readable name of your app (e.g., "My Awesome App").
- **`slug`:** A URL-friendly identifier for your app (e.g., "my-awesome-app"). Used for Expo URLs and project identification.
- **`version`:** The app's version number (e.g., "1.0.0"). Follow semantic versioning (semver) conventions.
- **`orientation`:** The allowed screen orientation (e.g., "portrait", "landscape", "default").
- **`icon`:** Path to your app's icon.
- **`splash`:** Configuration for the splash screen displayed during app startup. Crucial for a good user experience.
  - `image`: Path to the splash screen image.
  - `resizeMode`: How the image should be resized (e.g., "contain", "cover", "stretch").
  - `backgroundColor`: Background color of the splash screen.
- **`updates`:** Configuration for Expo OTA (Over-the-Air) updates.
  - `fallbackToCacheTimeout`: The time (in seconds) to wait for an update to be downloaded before falling back to the cached version.
- **`assetBundlePatterns`:** An array of glob patterns that specify which files should be included in the app's asset bundle. Defaults to `["**/*"]`.
- **`ios`:** Platform-specific configuration for iOS.
  - `supportsTablet`: Whether the app supports iPad.
  - `bundleIdentifier` (required for submitting to the App Store): Your app's unique bundle identifier (e.g., "com.example.myapp").
  - `buildNumber`: The build number (incremented for each build you submit).
  - `infoPlist` (advanced): Allows setting custom values in the `Info.plist` file.
- **`android`:** Platform-specific configuration for Android.
  - `adaptiveIcon`: Configuration for the adaptive icon (used in Android 8.0 and later).
    - `foregroundImage`: Path to the foreground image.
    - `backgroundColor`: Background color of the icon.
  - `package` (required for publishing to the Play Store): Your app's unique package name (e.g., "com.example.myapp").
  - `versionCode`: The version code (incremented for each build you submit).
  - `permissions`: An array of Android permissions that your app requires (e.g., `["CAMERA", "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"]`).
- **`web`:** Platform-specific configuration for web.
  - `favicon`: Path to your app's favicon.

## Working with Environment Variables

Environment variables are essential for managing different configurations for different environments (development, staging, production). Expo provides built-in support for environment variables when using `app.config.js`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install `dotenv`:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install dotenv --save-dev
    # or
    yarn add dotenv --dev
    ```

2.  **Create `.env` files:** Create separate `.env` files for each environment (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`). Make sure to `.gitignore` the `.env` files to prevent sensitive information from being committed to your repository.

3.  **Define environment variables in `.env` files:**

    ```
    # .env.development
    APP_NAME=My Development App
    API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

    # .env.production
    APP_NAME=My Production App
    API_URL=https://api.example.com/api
    ```

4.  **Load environment variables in `app.config.js`:**

    ```plaintext
    import 'dotenv/config'

    export default ({ config }) => {
      return {
        ...config,
        name: process.env.APP_NAME,
        extra: {
          apiUrl: process.env.API_URL,
        },
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Access environment variables in your app:**

    ```plaintext
    import Constants from 'expo-constants'

    const apiUrl = Constants.expoConfig.extra.apiUrl
    console.log('API URL:', apiUrl)
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) to your repository. Use environment variables and `.gitignore` appropriately.
- Define default values for environment variables in your `app.config.js` file to prevent errors if an environment variable is not set.
- Use different `.env` files for each environment to ensure proper configuration separation.

## Optimizing for Updates and Deployment

The Expo manifest plays a crucial role in managing updates and deployments.

**Expo OTA Updates:**

Expo's OTA (Over-the-Air) updates allow you to push updates to your app's JavaScript code and assets without requiring users to download a new version from the app stores. This significantly speeds up the update process and improves the user experience.

**Configuration in `app.json` or `app.config.js`:**

- **`updates.fallbackToCacheTimeout`:** This setting determines how long the app will wait for an update to download before falling back to the cached version. A value of `0` means the app will always try to download the latest update. A higher value (e.g., `3600` for 1 hour) can improve the user experience on slow or unreliable networks.
- **`runtimeVersion`**: Specifies the Expo runtime version your application is compatible with. Used for more granular update management.
- **`owner`**: The Expo account username that owns the project.
- **`slug`**: As noted before, the slug identifies your app and impacts the updates.

**Using EAS Build and Submit:**

Expo Application Services (EAS) Build and Submit streamline the process of building and submitting your app to the app stores. The manifest is automatically used by EAS to configure the build process.

**Key benefits:**

- Automated builds for iOS and Android.
- Simplified code signing and provisioning.
- Easy submission to the App Store and Play Store.

## Best Practices for Expo Manifest Management

- **Use `app.config.js` for most projects:** The flexibility and power of JavaScript/TypeScript outweigh the simplicity of `app.json` in most cases.
- **Leverage environment variables:** Manage different configurations for different environments effectively.
- **Keep your manifest clean and organized:** Avoid unnecessary complexity and duplication.
- **Document your configuration:** Add comments to your `app.config.js` file to explain the purpose of different settings.
- **Use a consistent naming convention:** Follow a consistent naming convention for environment variables and configuration options.
- **Test your configuration thoroughly:** Ensure that your app behaves as expected in different environments.
- **Version control your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:** Track changes to your configuration over time.
- **Consider using a schema validation tool:** Tools like JSON Schema can help you validate your `app.json` file and catch errors early.
- **Regularly review and update your manifest:** As your app evolves, make sure to review and update your manifest accordingly.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Changes to `app.json` or `app.config.js` are not reflected:** Ensure you've rebuilt the app or cleared the Expo cache. Sometimes, you need to run `expo start -c` to clear the cache.
- **Environment variables are not being loaded:** Double-check that you have installed `dotenv` and that your `.env` files are correctly configured and located in the root of your project. Also, ensure that you've imported `dotenv/config` in your `app.config.js` file.
- **Build fails due to manifest errors:** Carefully review your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file for syntax errors or invalid configuration options. Use a JSON validator or TypeScript compiler to catch errors early.
- **OTA updates are not working:** Verify that your `updates` configuration is correct and that your Expo account is properly configured. Check the Expo CLI output for any error messages.
- **App crashes on startup:** This can be due to a variety of reasons, including invalid manifest configuration, missing dependencies, or runtime errors. Use the Expo CLI and debugging tools to diagnose the issue.

## Conclusion

The Expo manifest is a powerful tool for managing your React Native app's configuration and deployment. By understanding the key configuration options, leveraging environment variables, and following best practices, you can streamline your development workflow, optimize your app for different environments, and deliver a high-quality user experience. Mastering the `app.json` or `app.config.js` is essential for any serious Expo developer. Remember to choose the file type that best suits your project's complexity and requirements. Happy coding!
