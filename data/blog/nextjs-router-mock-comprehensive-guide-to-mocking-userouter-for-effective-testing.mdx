# Next.js Router Mock: Comprehensive Guide to Mocking `useRouter` for Effective Testing

Testing is a crucial part of building robust and maintainable Next.js applications.  One common challenge arises when testing components that rely on the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`.  Manually managing router context in your tests can be cumbersome and error-prone.  That's where `next-router-mock` comes in!  This package provides a clean and simple way to mock the `useRouter` hook, enabling you to write more effective and focused tests.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about `next-router-mock`, from installation to advanced usage scenarios. We'll cover how to integrate it with Jest and React Testing Library to simplify your testing workflow.

## What is `next-router-mock`?

`next-router-mock` is a lightweight library that simplifies the process of mocking the `useRouter` hook in your Next.js tests.  It provides a `mockRouter` function that allows you to easily set up a mock router instance with configurable properties like `pathname`, `query`, `asPath`, and more.  This eliminates the need to manually create a mock context or use complicated workarounds, resulting in cleaner and more readable tests.

## Why Use `next-router-mock`?

Here are the key benefits of using `next-router-mock` in your Next.js testing:

*   **Simplified Testing:** Drastically reduces the boilerplate code required to mock the router.
*   **Improved Test Readability:** Makes your tests easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Focused Testing:** Allows you to isolate and test individual components without being concerned about complex routing logic.
*   **Realistic Mocking:** Provides a flexible and customizable mock router that accurately simulates the behavior of the real `useRouter` hook.
*   **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with popular testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.

## Installation

To get started with `next-router-mock`, install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install next-router-mock --save-dev
# or
yarn add next-router-mock --dev
```

## Basic Usage with Jest

The simplest way to use `next-router-mock` is to import `mockRouter` and call it before each test or in a `beforeEach` block. This will mock the `useRouter` hook for the scope of your test.

```javascript
// myComponent.test.js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './myComponent';
import { mockRouter } from 'next-router-mock';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockRouter.mock(); // Mock the router
  });

  it('renders correctly with default router values', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />);
    // Assertions based on the default mocked router values
    expect(screen.getByText('Current Path: /')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**myComponent.js**

```javascript
// myComponent.js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Path: {router.pathname}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we're mocking the `useRouter` hook before each test.  The component `MyComponent` uses the `router.pathname` property, which will be set to the default value of `/` by `next-router-mock`.

## Customizing the Router

You can customize the mocked router's properties by passing an object to the `mockRouter.mock()` function:

```javascript
// myComponent.test.js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './myComponent';
import { mockRouter } from 'next-router-mock';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockRouter.mock({
      pathname: '/about',
      query: { id: '123' },
      asPath: '/about?id=123',
    });
  });

  it('renders correctly with custom router values', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Current Path: /about')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Query ID: 123')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**myComponent.js**

```javascript
// myComponent.js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Path: {router.pathname}</p>
      <p>Query ID: {router.query.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Here, we're setting the `pathname`, `query`, and `asPath` properties to specific values. This allows you to test how your component behaves with different router configurations.

## Integrating with React Testing Library

`next-router-mock` works seamlessly with React Testing Library.  You can use it to render your components within a mocked router context and then use React Testing Library's powerful query methods to make assertions about the rendered output.

The examples above already demonstrates the use with React Testing Library. Let's delve into a more advanced example involving navigation.

```javascript
// myComponent.test.js
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './myComponent';
import { mockRouter } from 'next-router-mock';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockRouter.mock();
  });

  it('navigates to a new page when the button is clicked', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />);
    const button = screen.getByText('Go to About');
    fireEvent.click(button);

    expect(mockRouter.push).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/about');
  });
});
```

**myComponent.js**

```javascript
// myComponent.js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/about');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we're testing that the `router.push` function is called with the correct argument when the button is clicked.  `next-router-mock` automatically provides a mock implementation for the `router.push` function, allowing you to assert that it's called with the expected values.

## Advanced Usage and Configurations

`next-router-mock` offers several advanced features and configurations to handle more complex testing scenarios:

*   **Mocking Specific Router Methods:**  You can mock individual router methods like `push`, `replace`, and `reload` using `mockRouter.push.mockImplementation()`, `mockRouter.replace.mockImplementation()`, and `mockRouter.reload.mockImplementation()`.

    ```javascript
    beforeEach(() => {
      mockRouter.mock();
      mockRouter.push.mockImplementation((url) => {
        console.log(`Navigating to: ${url}`);
      });
    });
    ```

*   **Resetting the Mock:** After each test, especially when you're mocking specific methods, it's essential to reset the mock using `mockRouter.mockReset()` to avoid interference between tests.

    ```javascript
    afterEach(() => {
      mockRouter.mockReset();
    });
    ```

*   **Using a Custom Router Context:** For more complex scenarios, you can create your own custom router context using `createRouter()` and then provide it to your components. This allows for greater control over the mocked router's behavior.  (This is less common as `mockRouter.mock()` generally suffices).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter when using `next-router-mock` and how to resolve them:

*   **`ReferenceError: useRouter is not defined`:**  Make sure you're importing the `useRouter` hook correctly from `next/router`.

*   **Tests are failing because of unexpected router behavior:** Ensure that you're calling `mockRouter.mock()` before each test or in a `beforeEach` block to properly mock the router.  Also remember to `mockReset()` after each test if you're modifying the mock.

*   **Components are not re-rendering after router changes:**  Check that your components are properly subscribed to router changes.  The `useRouter` hook should trigger re-renders when the router's properties change.

*   **`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')`:**  This usually means that `mockRouter.mock()` wasn't called properly, or you're trying to access router methods before the mock is set up.

## Best Practices

*   **Mock only what you need:** Avoid mocking the entire `useRouter` object if you only need to mock a specific property or method. This helps to keep your tests focused and less prone to errors.
*   **Reset the mock after each test:** Call `mockRouter.mockReset()` after each test to ensure that the mock is reset to its initial state.  This prevents state from leaking between tests.
*   **Use descriptive test names:**  Use clear and descriptive test names that accurately reflect the behavior you're testing.
*   **Keep your tests small and focused:**  Each test should focus on testing a specific aspect of your component's behavior.
