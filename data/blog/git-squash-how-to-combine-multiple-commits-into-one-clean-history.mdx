# Git Squash: How to Combine Multiple Commits into One (Clean History!)

Maintaining a clean and readable Git history is crucial for effective collaboration and code maintainability.  One way to achieve this is by squashing multiple commits into a single, more descriptive commit.  This is particularly useful for combining small, incremental changes made during development into a cohesive unit.  This guide will walk you through different methods of squashing commits in Git, along with best practices to keep your repository tidy.

## Why Squash Commits?

Squashing commits offers several benefits:

*   **Cleaner History:**  Reduces noise and clutter in your Git log, making it easier to understand the project's evolution.
*   **Improved Collaboration:** Easier for other developers to review changes when they are grouped logically.
*   **Simplified Bisecting:** Makes it easier to find the source of bugs using `git bisect` by reducing the number of commits to examine.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** A clear and concise history allows developers to quickly grasp the purpose of changes.

## Method 1: Interactive Rebase (The Recommended Approach)

Interactive rebasing is the most common and flexible way to squash commits.  It allows you to select which commits to squash, reword commit messages, and even delete commits if necessary.

**Step 1: Identify the Commit to Start Rebasing From**

You need to identify the commit *before* the commits you want to squash.  This is the commit you will start your interactive rebase from. You can find this commit by using `git log`.  For example, let's say you want to squash the last three commits. You'd need to identify the commit immediately *before* these three.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This command displays a concise history of your commits with their commit hashes.

**Step 2: Initiate the Interactive Rebase**

Use the `git rebase -i` command followed by the commit hash you identified in the previous step.  Alternatively, you can use `HEAD~N` to specify the number of commits back from the current `HEAD`. For example, to rebase the last three commits, you'd use `HEAD~3`.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Rebase the last 3 commits

# OR

git rebase -i <commit-hash>  # Replace <commit-hash> with the actual hash
```

This command opens your default text editor with a list of the commits you're rebasing.  The editor will display something similar to this:

```
pick 8f7a2b3 Add feature A
pick 1c9d4e5 Fix bug in feature A
pick 5e3f6a1 Implement additional improvements to feature A

# Rebase e7c8d90..5e3f6a1 onto e7c8d90 (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, log <commit> = show commit log
# s, start <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# t, reset <commit> = reset HEAD to commit, but keep changes
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# B, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# b, bash <command> = run <command>, then stop for amending
# u, update-ref = update ref
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
#       However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
#
```

**Step 3: Edit the Rebase Instructions**

In the editor, change the `pick` command for the commits you want to squash to `squash` (or `s`).  Leave the first commit as `pick`.  This tells Git to merge those commits into the first `pick` commit.  Using `fixup` (or `f`) is an option if you don't want to keep the commit message of the squashed commit.  It will discard the squashed commit's message and use the message of the "pick" commit.

For example, to squash the last three commits into one, change the file to look like this:

```
pick 8f7a2b3 Add feature A
squash 1c9d4e5 Fix bug in feature A
squash 5e3f6a1 Implement additional improvements to feature A
```

Save the file and close the editor.

**Step 4: Edit the Commit Message**

Git will now open your editor again, prompting you to edit the commit message for the squashed commit.  This is where you can create a clear and concise message that summarizes all the changes from the combined commits.  It will pre-populate the editor with the commit messages of the original commits.  You can keep them, modify them, or write a completely new message.

For example:

```
Add feature A with fixes and improvements

This commit combines the initial implementation of feature A with a bug fix and several improvements to enhance its functionality.

* Added initial implementation of feature A.
* Fixed a bug related to [specific issue].
* Implemented performance optimizations.
* Added unit tests for increased code coverage.

# This is a combination of 3 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

# Add feature A

# This is the 2nd commit message:

# Fix bug in feature A

# This is the 3rd commit message:

# Implement additional improvements to feature A
```

Save the file and close the editor.

**Step 5: Complete the Rebase**

Git will now apply the changes and create the squashed commit.  If everything goes smoothly, you should see a message indicating that the rebase was successful.

**Handling Conflicts**

Sometimes, squashing commits can result in conflicts.  If this happens, Git will pause the rebase and prompt you to resolve the conflicts manually.  Use `git status` to identify the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts in your editor, and then run `git add` to stage the resolved files.  Finally, run `git rebase --continue` to continue the rebase.

**Aborting the Rebase**

If you encounter problems or decide you don't want to continue the rebase, you can abort it by running `git rebase --abort`. This will return your repository to its original state before the rebase.

## Method 2: Automatic Squashing (using `git commit --fixup` and `git rebase --autosquash`)

This method is useful for adding small fixes to older commits. It leverages the `--fixup` flag when committing and `--autosquash` during rebase.

**Step 1: Commit the Fix with `--fixup`**

When you've made a fix for an older commit, use the `git commit --fixup` command followed by the hash of the commit you want to fix.  This creates a new commit with a special message that tells Git to squash it into the specified commit during rebase.

```bash
git commit --fixup <commit-hash> -m "Fix: Typo in variable name"
```

**Step 2: Rebase with `--autosquash`**

Initiate an interactive rebase, including the `--autosquash` flag. This will automatically reorder and mark your fixup commits for squashing.

```bash
git rebase -i --autosquash <commit-hash-before-first-commit-to-fix>
```

Or, if you want to autosquash the last N commits:

```bash
git rebase -i --autosquash HEAD~N
```

The rebase editor will open with the `fixup!` commits already ordered correctly and marked for squashing:

```
pick 8f7a2b3 Add feature A
fixup 1c9d4e5 Fix: Typo in variable name
pick 5e3f6a1 Implement additional improvements to feature A
```

Save the file and close the editor.  Git will automatically squash the fixup commits into the corresponding commits. You might still be prompted to edit commit messages if there are conflicts.

## Method 3: Using Git Reset (Less Recommended)

While possible, using `git reset` for squashing is generally less recommended than interactive rebasing. It rewrites history and can be confusing for collaborators.

**Step 1: Reset to the Desired Commit**

Use `git reset --soft <commit-before-squash>` to move the `HEAD` pointer back to the commit before the commits you want to squash. The `--soft` flag preserves your changes in the staging area.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~3  # Reset to 3 commits before HEAD
```

**Step 2: Commit the Changes**

Commit the staged changes with a new, combined commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "Combined changes from multiple commits"
```

**Warning:** This method can lead to data loss if you use `--hard` instead of `--soft`. Also, be very cautious when using this technique on public branches, as it rewrites history and can cause issues for other developers.

## Best Practices for Squashing Commits

*   **Squash Locally:** Squash commits on your local branch before pushing to a shared repository to avoid rewriting history that others might be relying on.
*   **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that accurately reflect the combined changes.
*   **Don't Squash Public Branches:** Avoid squashing commits on branches that are shared with other developers unless you have a very good reason to do so and you communicate the change effectively.  Rewriting public history can cause significant problems.
*   **Consider the Scope:** Squash commits that relate to a single feature or bug fix. Avoid creating overly large commits that are difficult to understand.
*   **Use Interactive Rebase:** Interactive rebasing provides the most control and flexibility when squashing commits.

## Conclusion

Squashing commits is a valuable technique for maintaining a clean and organized Git history. By using interactive rebasing, automatic squashing or even `git reset` (with caution), you can combine related changes into meaningful units, improve collaboration, and simplify code maintainability. Remember to follow best practices to avoid disrupting your team's workflow and keep your repository healthy.
