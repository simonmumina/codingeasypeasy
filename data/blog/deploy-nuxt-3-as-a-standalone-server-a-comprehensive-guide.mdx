# Deploy Nuxt 3 as a Standalone Server: A Comprehensive Guide

Nuxt.js is a powerful Vue.js framework that simplifies building web applications. While serverless deployments are popular for their scalability and cost-effectiveness, deploying Nuxt as a standalone Node.js server offers greater control, flexibility, and potentially better performance for certain use cases. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of deploying your Nuxt 3 application as a standalone server, covering everything from building your app to configuring a reverse proxy and process manager.

## Why Deploy Nuxt as a Standalone Server?

Before diving in, let's consider why you might choose a standalone server deployment over serverless:

- **Full Control:** You have complete control over the server environment, allowing you to fine-tune configurations and install specific dependencies.
- **Performance:** For applications with complex server-side logic or database interactions, a dedicated server can offer better performance than serverless functions, which often have cold start times.
- **Customization:** Standalone servers allow you to customize the underlying infrastructure and middleware as needed.
- **Cost:** In some scenarios, a dedicated server might be more cost-effective than serverless, especially for applications with consistent traffic.
- **Websockets and Realtime Applications:** Standalone servers are well-suited for websocket-based applications or those requiring persistent connections, which can be challenging with serverless functions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Nuxt 3 Project:** A working Nuxt 3 application.
- **Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm):** Installed on your local machine and ideally on your server. Node.js version 16 or higher is recommended for Nuxt 3.
- **Server Access:** Access to a virtual private server (VPS), dedicated server, or cloud instance (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, DigitalOcean Droplet).
- **Basic Linux Command-Line Knowledge:** Familiarity with basic Linux commands is helpful.

## Step 1: Building Your Nuxt 3 Application

The first step is to build your Nuxt 3 application for production. Run the following command in your project directory:

```plaintext
npm run build  # Or yarn build or pnpm build
```

This command will generate a `.nuxt` directory containing the built files, which are optimized for production. The `.output` directory will be created at the project root, and contains everything you need to deploy.

## Step 2: Transferring the Built Files to Your Server

Next, you need to transfer the `.output` directory to your server. You can use various methods, such as:

- **SCP (Secure Copy):**

  ```plaintext
  scp -r .output user@your_server_ip:/path/to/your/app
  ```

- **rsync:**

  ```plaintext
  rsync -avz .output user@your_server_ip:/path/to/your/app
  ```

- **Git:** If your project is already in a Git repository, you can simply clone the repository onto your server and then run `npm install` and `npm run build` on the server. However, this guide assumes you're transferring the built artifacts directly.

Remember to replace `user@your_server_ip` with your server's username and IP address, and `/path/to/your/app` with the desired directory on your server where you want to place your application.

## Step 3: Installing Dependencies on the Server

Once the files are transferred, SSH into your server and navigate to the application directory:

```plaintext
ssh user@your_server_ip
cd /path/to/your/app
```

If you haven't already installed the production dependencies when building locally (recommended!), you need to install them on the server:

```plaintext
npm install --production # Or yarn install --production or pnpm install --production
```

The `--production` flag ensures that only the dependencies required for production are installed.
If you built on the server, you would have installed these as part of that process.

## Step 4: Starting Your Nuxt 3 Server

Nuxt 3 can be started directly using Node.js. Inside the `.output` directory, you will find a `server` directory that contains the server entry point. You can start the server using the following command:

```plaintext
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

By default, Nuxt 3 will run on port 3000. You should see output indicating the server is listening on this port.

**Note:** This command will only keep the server running as long as the terminal window is open. We'll use PM2 in the next step to ensure the server runs persistently.

## Step 5: Using PM2 for Process Management (Recommended)

PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It automatically restarts your application if it crashes, provides monitoring capabilities, and allows you to manage your application easily.

**Install PM2:**

```plaintext
npm install -g pm2  # Or yarn global add pm2 or pnpm add -g pm2
```

**Start Your Nuxt 3 Server with PM2:**

```plaintext
pm2 start .output/server/index.mjs --name nuxt-app
```

This command will start your Nuxt 3 application using PM2 and give it the name `nuxt-app`. You can replace `nuxt-app` with a more descriptive name if you prefer.

**PM2 Management Commands:**

- `pm2 list`: Lists all running PM2 processes.
- `pm2 stop nuxt-app`: Stops the Nuxt application.
- `pm2 restart nuxt-app`: Restarts the Nuxt application.
- `pm2 delete nuxt-app`: Deletes the Nuxt application from PM2's process list.
- `pm2 logs nuxt-app`: Shows the logs for the Nuxt application.
- `pm2 monit`: Provides a real-time monitoring dashboard in the terminal.

**Configure PM2 to Start on Boot:**

To ensure your Nuxt 3 application automatically restarts when the server reboots, run the following command:

```plaintext
pm2 startup systemd
```

This command will generate a startup script for your system's init system (e.g., systemd, upstart). Follow the instructions provided by PM2 to complete the setup. Usually, it will involve running another command like:

```plaintext
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u <your_user> --hp /home/<your_user>
```

Then, save the current PM2 process list to be restored on reboot:

```plaintext
pm2 save
```

## Step 6: Setting up a Reverse Proxy with Nginx (Recommended)

While your Nuxt 3 application is now running, it's generally not a good idea to expose it directly to the internet. A reverse proxy, such as Nginx, acts as an intermediary between the client and your application, providing several benefits:

- **Security:** Nginx can protect your application from direct attacks.
- **Load Balancing:** Nginx can distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **Caching:** Nginx can cache static assets to improve performance.
- **SSL/TLS Termination:** Nginx can handle SSL/TLS encryption, freeing up your application to focus on other tasks.
- **Custom Domain:** Allows you to map a domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) to your application.

**Install Nginx:**

```plaintext
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx  # For Debian/Ubuntu systems
```

or

```plaintext
sudo yum install nginx # For CentOS/RHEL systems
```

**Configure Nginx:**

Create a new Nginx configuration file for your Nuxt 3 application. This file will define how Nginx should handle requests and proxy them to your Nuxt 3 server.

```plaintext
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/nuxt-app
```

Paste the following configuration into the file, replacing `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Proxy to your Nuxt 3 server
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    # Optional: Serve static files directly from Nginx (if you have any)
    # location /static {
    #     alias /path/to/your/app/public/static;
    #     expires 30d;
    # }
}
```

**Explanation of the Nginx Configuration:**

- `listen 80;`: Listens for HTTP traffic on port 80.
- `server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;`: Specifies the domain names that this configuration should handle.
- `location / { ... }`: Defines how to handle all requests to the root path (`/`).
- `proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;`: Proxies requests to your Nuxt 3 server running on port 3000.
- `proxy_http_version 1.1;`: Sets the HTTP version to 1.1, which is required for WebSocket support.
- `proxy_set_header ...`: Sets various headers to ensure that the client's request is properly forwarded to the Nuxt 3 server.
- `proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;`: Prevents caching for websocket connections.

**Enable the Nginx Configuration:**

Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:

```plaintext
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nuxt-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

**Test and Restart Nginx:**

Test the Nginx configuration for errors:

```plaintext
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful, restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Configure Firewall (if necessary):**

If you have a firewall enabled (e.g., `ufw`), you may need to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic:

```plaintext
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTPS'
sudo ufw enable
```

## Step 7: Setting up SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt (Recommended)

To secure your website with HTTPS, you can use Let's Encrypt, a free and automated certificate authority.

**Install Certbot:**

```plaintext
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx # For Debian/Ubuntu
```

or

```plaintext
sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-nginx #For Centos/RHEL. You may need to enable the EPEL repository first
```

**Obtain a Let's Encrypt Certificate:**

Run Certbot to automatically obtain and configure an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain:

```plaintext
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```

Certbot will prompt you to answer a few questions and automatically update your Nginx configuration to use the certificate. Follow the prompts carefully. It usually involves selecting option 2 "Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS".

**Test HTTPS:**

Open your website in a browser and verify that it is accessible via HTTPS (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`). You should see a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating that the connection is secure.

## Step 8: (Optional) Using Docker

For a more reproducible and portable deployment, consider using Docker to containerize your Nuxt 3 application.

**Create a Dockerfile:**

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your Nuxt 3 project:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire project
COPY . .

# Build the Nuxt application
RUN npm run build

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["node", ".output/server/index.mjs"]
```

**Build the Docker Image:**

```plaintext
docker build -t nuxt-app .
```

**Run the Docker Container:**

```plaintext
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name nuxt-app nuxt-app
```

This will run the Nuxt app in detached mode, exposing port 3000. You will still need to configure Nginx to proxy requests to the Docker container, which will be running on the same server (localhost:3000).

**Docker Compose (Optional):**

For more complex deployments, you can use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers (e.g., your Nuxt application and a database). Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```plaintext
version: '3.8'
services:
  nuxt-app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    restart: always #restart the container automatically
```

Then, run:

```plaintext
docker-compose up -d
```

Docker is a powerful tool that can significantly simplify the deployment process and ensure consistency across different environments.

## Troubleshooting

- **"502 Bad Gateway" Error:** This typically indicates that Nginx cannot connect to your Nuxt 3 server. Double-check that your Nuxt 3 server is running and that the `proxy_pass` directive in your Nginx configuration is correct. Also ensure that any firewalls are configured to allow connections from Nginx to the Nuxt application.
- **Application Not Updating After Changes:** Make sure you rebuild your Nuxt 3 application (`npm run build`) and transfer the updated files to your server after making changes. Restart your Nuxt 3 server (using PM2) or restart the Docker container to apply the changes. Clear your browser's cache to see the latest version.
- **"Cannot Find Module" Error:** This usually means that some dependencies are missing. Double-check that you have installed all the required dependencies on the server using `npm install --production`.
- **HTTPS Not Working:** Make sure that you have properly configured SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt and that your Nginx configuration is set up to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Check your Nginx configuration file using `sudo nginx -t`.

## Conclusion

Deploying Nuxt 3 as a standalone server provides greater control, flexibility, and potentially better performance compared to serverless deployments. By following this guide, you should be able to successfully deploy your Nuxt 3 application, configure a reverse proxy with Nginx, secure your website with SSL/TLS, and manage your application using PM2. Remember to tailor the configuration to your specific needs and environment. Good luck!
