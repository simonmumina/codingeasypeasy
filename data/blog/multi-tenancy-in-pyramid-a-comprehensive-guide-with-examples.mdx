# Multi-Tenancy in Pyramid: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Multi-tenancy is an architecture where a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers or "tenants." Each tenant's data is isolated from others, ensuring privacy and security. This approach offers benefits like reduced infrastructure costs, easier maintenance, and simplified deployments.

Pyramid, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, doesn't inherently provide multi-tenancy out of the box. However, its extensibility allows you to implement various multi-tenancy strategies based on your application's requirements. This article explores common approaches and provides practical code examples to help you build robust multi-tenant applications with Pyramid.

## Understanding Multi-Tenancy Architectures

Before diving into implementation, let's briefly discuss the different multi-tenancy architectures:

- **Database-per-tenant:** Each tenant has its dedicated database. This provides the highest level of isolation but can be more resource-intensive to manage.
- **Schema-per-tenant:** All tenants share a single database, but each has its dedicated schema (namespace). This offers a good balance between isolation and resource utilization.
- **Shared Database, Shared Schema:** All tenants share the same database and schema. Tenant data is distinguished by a tenant ID column in each table. This is the simplest to implement but offers the least isolation and can lead to performance issues if not carefully designed.

This guide will focus primarily on the **Schema-per-tenant** and **Domain-based** approaches, as they strike a good balance between isolation and manageability for many applications.

## Schema-per-Tenant Implementation

This approach leverages database schemas to isolate tenant data. Each tenant receives its own schema within the shared database.

### Steps Involved:

1.  **Identifying the Tenant:** Determine how to identify the tenant for each request. Common methods include:
    - **Subdomain/Domain:** `tenant1.example.com`, `tenant2.example.com`
    - **URL Path:** `/tenant1/`, `/tenant2/`
    - **Authentication (User Context):** Tenant associated with the logged-in user.
2.  **Creating Database Schemas:** Provision a new schema for each tenant.
3.  **Dynamically Switching Schemas:** Use middleware or request extensions to switch the active schema based on the identified tenant.
4.  **Data Access with SQLAlchemy (Example):** Configure SQLAlchemy to use the correct schema for each tenant.

### Code Example (using subdomain/domain for tenant identification):

**1. Configuration (using `pyramid.config.Configurator`)**

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator
from pyramid.events import NewRequest
from pyramid.response import Response
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Define the base for declarative models
Base = declarative_base()

# Define a simple model (Example)
class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'items'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Item(name='{self.name}')>"


def get_tenant_id(request):
    """Extracts the tenant ID from the domain (e.g., tenant1.example.com)"""
    hostname = request.host.split('.')[0] # 'tenant1'
    return hostname

def set_tenant_schema(event):
    """Sets the database schema based on the tenant ID."""
    request = event.request
    tenant_id = get_tenant_id(request)
    engine = request.registry.settings['sqlalchemy.engine']
    connection = engine.connect()
    connection.execute(f"SET search_path TO {tenant_id}, public")  # Securely escape tenant_id if needed
    connection.close()
    request.tenant_id = tenant_id  # Store tenant_id in request


def includeme(config):
    """Pyramid includeme function for setting up the application."""
    settings = config.get_settings()

    # Database setup (replace with your actual connection string)
    engine = create_engine(settings['sqlalchemy.url'])

    # Store engine in registry for access later
    config.registry.settings['sqlalchemy.engine'] = engine

    # Add the tenant_id to each request
    config.add_request_method(get_tenant_id, 'tenant_id', reify=True)

    # Subscribe to the NewRequest event to set the schema
    config.add_subscriber(set_tenant_schema, NewRequest)

    # Add routes
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.scan() #scan views.py


def main(global_config, **settings):
    """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
    """
    with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
        config.include('pyramid_chameleon') # Or your template engine
        config.include(includeme)

        config.add_static_view(name='static', path='static')  # Serve static files
        config.scan()
        return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

**2. `views.py` (Example)**

```plaintext
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.response import Response
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from .models import Item, Base # Assuming your models are in models.py

@view_config(route_name='home', renderer='templates/home.pt')
def home_view(request):
    """Home view to display items."""
    engine = request.registry.settings['sqlalchemy.engine']
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine) # Creates tables ONLY if they don't exist
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    items = session.query(Item).all()  # Query data from the correct tenant schema

    return {'items': items}


@view_config(route_name='add_item', renderer='json', request_method='POST')
def add_item_view(request):
    engine = request.registry.settings['sqlalchemy.engine']
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    name = request.POST.get('name')
    if name:
        new_item = Item(name=name)
        session.add(new_item)
        session.commit()
        return {'success': True, 'message': 'Item added'}
    else:
        return {'success': False, 'message': 'Name is required'}
```

**3. `models.py` (Example)**

```plaintext
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'items' #table name doesn't have schema because Base is configured at runtime
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Item(name='{self.name}')>"

```

**4. Configuration (e.g., `development.ini`)**

```ini
[app:main]
use = egg:MyPyramidApp # Replace with your application name
pyramid.reload_templates = true
pyramid.debug_authorization = false
pyramid.debug_notfound = false
pyramid.debug_templates = true
pyramid.default_locale_name = en
sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/multitenant_db # Replace with your database URL

[server:main]
use = egg:waitress#waitress
listen = *:6543
```

**Explanation:**

- `get_tenant_id(request)`: Extracts the tenant ID from the subdomain. You might use a different method depending on how you are identifying tenants.
- `set_tenant_schema(event)`: This function is triggered on each new request. It retrieves the tenant ID and executes `SET search_path TO tenant_id, public` to set the database schema for the current connection. **Important:** Ensure `tenant_id` is properly escaped to prevent SQL injection. A library like `psycopg2.extensions.quote_ident` (if using PostgreSQL) or similar escaping functions for other databases, should be used here for security.
- `sqlalchemy.url`: The SQLAlchemy connection string.
- `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`: This creates tables only if they don't already exist within the currently active schema.
- In `views.py`, the query `session.query(Item).all()` will automatically execute against the `items` table within the tenant's schema because the `search_path` has been set.

**Important Security Considerations:**

- **SQL Injection:** The most critical security aspect is preventing SQL injection. Never directly concatenate the tenant ID into the `SET search_path` command without proper escaping. Use parameterized queries or database-specific escaping functions.
- **Schema Existence Validation:** Before setting the search path, validate that the schema actually exists in the database. This prevents errors if a malicious user tries to access a non-existent tenant.
- **Database Permissions:** Ensure that the database user used by your Pyramid application has the necessary permissions to create and modify schemas. Limit these permissions to only what is absolutely required.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

### Creating Schemas

You'll need a mechanism to create and manage schemas when new tenants sign up. This can be done through an administrative interface or a command-line script. Here's an example using SQLAlchemy Core:

```plaintext
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

def create_tenant_schema(tenant_id, database_url):
    """Creates a new schema for the given tenant ID."""
    engine = create_engine(database_url)  #Database URL of main database
    conn = engine.connect()
    conn.execute(f"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS {tenant_id}") #securely escape tenant_id
    conn.close()
    engine.dispose()

#Example Usage
create_tenant_schema("tenant3", "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/multitenant_db")
```

Remember to securely escape the `tenant_id` when creating the schema.

## Domain-based Multi-Tenancy

Domain-based multi-tenancy is an approach where each tenant is assigned their own domain or subdomain. This is often combined with the Schema-per-Tenant approach for stronger isolation. The basic principle is to route requests to the correct tenant based on the incoming hostname.

This approach is inherently implemented using the previous Schema-per-tenant example and can be configured during deployment. Different virtual hosts must be configured for each domain.

### Configuration

1.  **DNS Configuration:** Configure your DNS records to point each tenant's domain or subdomain to your server's IP address.
2.  **Web Server Configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache):** Configure your web server to route requests based on the hostname.
3.  **Pyramid Application:** Implement the `get_tenant_id` function to extract the tenant ID from the `request.host` attribute as shown in the Schema-per-Tenant example.
4.  **Deployment Environment:** The domain configurations for each tenant must be considered within the deployment environment. Tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc, can assist in scaling these applications.

```nginx
# Example Nginx configuration
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name tenant1.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:6543; # Your Pyramid application
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name tenant2.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:6543; # Your Pyramid application
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

### Advantages:

- **Clear Separation:** Tenants have their own unique domain names, providing a clear separation and branding opportunity.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale each tenant's application independently.

### Disadvantages:

- **Configuration Overhead:** Requires more configuration at the web server level.
- **Domain Management:** Tenants are responsible for managing their own domain names.

## Shared Database, Shared Schema (Tenant ID Column)

This approach is the simplest to implement. A tenant ID column is added to each relevant table in your database. All tenants share the same database and schema, and queries are filtered by the tenant ID.

### Implementation

1.  **Add Tenant ID Column:** Add a `tenant_id` column (e.g., `UUID`, `Integer`, `String`) to all tables containing tenant-specific data.
2.  **Modify Models:** Update your SQLAlchemy models to include the `tenant_id` column.
3.  **Filter Queries:** Modify your database queries to always filter by the `tenant_id` of the current tenant.
4.  **Middleware:** Implement middleware to determine the current tenant ID from the request (e.g., from a subdomain, URL path, or authentication context).

### Code Example (Illustrative - Adapt to your models):

```plaintext
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    tenant_id = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Tenant ID

class Article(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'articles'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String)
    content = Column(String)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))
    user = relationship("User")
    tenant_id = Column(String, ForeignKey('users.tenant_id'), nullable=False)  # Tenant ID


from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.request import Request

# Assumes tenant_id is in the request (see previous examples on setting it in middleware)
@view_config(route_name='articles', renderer='json')
def get_articles(request: Request):
    tenant_id = request.tenant_id
    engine = request.registry.settings['sqlalchemy.engine']
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()
    articles = session.query(Article).filter(Article.tenant_id == tenant_id).all()
    #OR using subquery if you want to apply tenant filtering to other relations
    user_subquery = session.query(User.id).filter(User.tenant_id == tenant_id).subquery()
    articles = session.query(Article).filter(Article.user_id.in_(user_subquery)).all()

    return [{'title': article.title, 'content': article.content} for article in articles]
```

### Advantages

- **Simple:** Relatively easy to implement.
- **Single Database:** Easier to manage a single database compared to multiple databases or schemas.

### Disadvantages

- **Data Isolation:** The weakest data isolation. A coding error could potentially expose data between tenants.
- **Performance:** Queries must always include the tenant ID filter, which can impact performance, especially on large datasets. Proper indexing is crucial.
- **Security:** Increased risk of data breaches due to shared database and schema.
- **Database Size:** Can lead to a very large database, making backups and restores more challenging.

## Choosing the Right Approach

The best multi-tenancy strategy depends on your application's specific requirements:

- **Security and Isolation:** If strong data isolation is paramount, **Database-per-tenant** is the best option, followed by **Schema-per-tenant**.
- **Scalability and Cost:** If you need to optimize resource utilization and minimize costs, **Schema-per-tenant** offers a good balance. **Shared Database, Shared Schema** is the least resource-intensive but has significant drawbacks.
- **Complexity:** **Shared Database, Shared Schema** is the simplest to implement. **Database-per-tenant** is the most complex.
- **Tenant Customization:** If tenants require significant database customizations (e.g., different schemas or data types), **Database-per-tenant** is necessary.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Certain compliance standards like HIPAA or PCI-DSS have strict data isolation requirements. Database-per-tenant might be necessary for compliance reasons.

## Conclusion

Implementing multi-tenancy in Pyramid requires careful planning and consideration of your application's needs. By understanding the different architectural approaches and applying the provided code examples, you can build robust and scalable multi-tenant applications. Remember to prioritize security and data isolation to protect your tenants' data. Always test your multi-tenancy implementation thoroughly to ensure that it meets your requirements and provides a secure and reliable service. Remember to consider security at every stage of development to prevent vulnerabilities and protect against attacks.
