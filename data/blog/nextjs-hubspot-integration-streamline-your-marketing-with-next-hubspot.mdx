# Next.js HubSpot Integration: Streamline Your Marketing with `next-hubspot`

HubSpot is a powerful platform for marketing automation, sales, and customer service. Integrating it with your Next.js application can significantly enhance your lead generation, customer engagement, and data analytics capabilities. The `next-hubspot` package simplifies this integration, providing a clean and efficient way to connect your Next.js frontend to your HubSpot backend.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively use `next-hubspot`, including setup, form submissions, tracking events, and best practices.

## Why Use `next-hubspot`?

While you could manually interact with the HubSpot API, `next-hubspot` provides several advantages:

- **Simplified Integration:** It abstracts away much of the complexity of interacting directly with the HubSpot API.
- **Type Safety:** Many of the functions are type-safe, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- **Form Management:** Easily handle HubSpot form submissions directly from your Next.js application.
- **Event Tracking:** Track custom events in HubSpot to gain valuable insights into user behavior.
- **Optimized for Next.js:** Designed specifically for Next.js, ensuring compatibility and performance.
- **Cookie Management:** Handles cookie consent and tracking consent.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) Compatibility:** Supports both SSR and SSG, allowing for flexible deployment options.

## Getting Started: Installation and Configuration

1.  **Install the Package:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install next-hubspot
    # or
    yarn add next-hubspot
    # or
    pnpm add next-hubspot
    ```

2.  **Configure HubSpot API Key (Important!):**

    You'll need a HubSpot API key. It's **highly recommended** to store this securely in your environment variables. Avoid committing it directly to your codebase.

    - **Create a `.env.local` file (if you don't already have one) at the root of your project:**

      ```
      HUBSPOT_API_KEY=YOUR_HUBSPOT_API_KEY
      ```

    - **In your `next.config.js` file, add the following to expose the environment variable to the browser (carefully consider the implications of exposing secrets):**

      ```plaintext
      /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
      const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: true,
        env: {
          NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID || '', // Replace '' with your actual HubSpot Portal ID.  Store in environment variables!
        },
      }

      module.exports = nextConfig
      ```

      **Important:** Make sure you're using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for the portal ID to expose it to the browser. The API Key should **NEVER** be exposed to the browser. It should only be used server-side.

    - **Add your HubSpot portal ID**
      You will also need your HubSpot portal ID. Find this in your HubSpot account.

    - **Install `dotenv`**

      ```plaintext
      npm install dotenv
      # or
      yarn add dotenv
      # or
      pnpm add dotenv
      ```

3.  **Create a `lib/hubspot.js` file (optional, but recommended for organization):**

    This file will contain helper functions and logic for interacting with the `next-hubspot` package. This is a good place to initialize the HubSpot client.

    ```plaintext
    // lib/hubspot.js

    import { HubSpotClient } from 'next-hubspot'

    // Initialize the HubSpot client (only on the server side)
    let hubspotClient

    if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
      // Ensure this only runs on the server
      hubspotClient = new HubSpotClient({
        apiKey: process.env.HUBSPOT_API_KEY,
      })
    }

    export { hubspotClient }

    export async function submitHubspotForm(portalId, formId, fields) {
      try {
        if (!hubspotClient) {
          console.warn(
            'HubSpot client not initialized.  Check your API key and environment variables.'
          )
          return { success: false, error: 'HubSpot client not initialized.' }
        }
        const response = await hubspotClient.forms.submitForm(portalId, formId, fields)
        return { success: true, data: response }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error submitting HubSpot form:', error)
        return { success: false, error: error.message || 'Failed to submit form.' }
      }
    }

    export async function trackHubspotEvent(eventName, properties = {}) {
      try {
        if (!hubspotClient) {
          console.warn(
            'HubSpot client not initialized.  Check your API key and environment variables.'
          )
          return { success: false, error: 'HubSpot client not initialized.' }
        }

        // Ensure the email address is included. This is crucial for identifying contacts.
        if (!properties.email) {
          console.warn(
            'Email address is required for identifying contacts in HubSpot event tracking.'
          )
          return { success: false, error: 'Email address is required for tracking.' }
        }

        const eventData = {
          eventName: eventName,
          properties: properties,
        }

        await hubspotClient.events.trackEvent(eventData)
        return { success: true }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error tracking HubSpot event:', error)
        return { success: false, error: error.message || 'Failed to track event.' }
      }
    }
    ```

## Submitting HubSpot Forms

The most common use case is submitting data from your website forms to HubSpot. Here's how to do it:

1.  **Create a Form in HubSpot:**

    - Design your form in HubSpot, specifying the fields you need to collect.
    - Note the **Portal ID** and **Form ID**. You'll need these in your Next.js code.

2.  **Create a Next.js Form Component:**

    ```plaintext
    // components/ContactForm.js
    import React, { useState } from 'react'
    import { submitHubspotForm } from '../lib/hubspot' // Import our helper function

    const ContactForm = () => {
      const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
        firstname: '',
        lastname: '',
        email: '',
        message: '',
      })

      const [submissionStatus, setSubmissionStatus] = useState({
        loading: false,
        success: false,
        error: null,
      })

      const handleChange = (e) => {
        setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value })
      }

      const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        setSubmissionStatus({ ...submissionStatus, loading: true })

        const portalId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID // Get from environment variables
        const formId = 'YOUR_HUBSPOT_FORM_ID' // Replace with your actual form ID

        // Map form data to HubSpot fields
        const fields = Object.entries(formData).map(([name, value]) => ({
          name,
          value,
        }))

        const result = await submitHubspotForm(portalId, formId, fields)

        if (result.success) {
          setSubmissionStatus({ loading: false, success: true, error: null })
          setFormData({ firstname: '', lastname: '', email: '', message: '' }) // Clear form
        } else {
          setSubmissionStatus({ loading: false, success: false, error: result.error })
        }
      }

      return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          {submissionStatus.error && (
            <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>Error: {submissionStatus.error}</div>
          )}
          {submissionStatus.success && (
            <div style={{ color: 'green' }}>Thank you for your submission!</div>
          )}
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="firstname">First Name:</label>
            <input
              type="text"
              id="firstname"
              name="firstname"
              value={formData.firstname}
              onChange={handleChange}
              required
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="lastname">Last Name:</label>
            <input
              type="text"
              id="lastname"
              name="lastname"
              value={formData.lastname}
              onChange={handleChange}
              required
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
            <input
              type="email"
              id="email"
              name="email"
              value={formData.email}
              onChange={handleChange}
              required
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="message">Message:</label>
            <textarea
              id="message"
              name="message"
              value={formData.message}
              onChange={handleChange}
            ></textarea>
          </div>
          <button type="submit" disabled={submissionStatus.loading}>
            {submissionStatus.loading ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
          </button>
        </form>
      )
    }

    export default ContactForm
    ```

3.  **Import the Component into Your Page:**

    ```plaintext
    // pages/contact.js
    import ContactForm from '../components/ContactForm'

    const ContactPage = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Contact Us</h1>
          <ContactForm />
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default ContactPage
    ```

**Explanation:**

- We create a form with controlled components, using `useState` to manage the form data.
- The `handleSubmit` function is called when the form is submitted.
- We fetch the `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` from environment variables and hardcode the `formId` (replace with your actual Form ID). Remember best practice is to store these as env variables and access via `process.env`.
- We use the `submitHubspotForm` function from `lib/hubspot.js` to submit the data to HubSpot. We map the form data to the structure HubSpot expects.
- We handle the success and error cases, updating the component's state and displaying appropriate messages to the user.

## Tracking Events

Tracking events allows you to gain insights into user behavior on your website.

1.  **Define Your Custom Event in HubSpot:**

    - In your HubSpot account, go to **Reports** > **Analytics Tools** > **Custom Behavioral Events**.
    - Create a new event and define its name and properties. Make sure you have a clear naming convention (e.g., `product_viewed`, `button_clicked`).

2.  **Track the Event in Your Next.js Component:**

    ```plaintext
    // components/ProductCard.js
    import React from 'react'
    import { trackHubspotEvent } from '../lib/hubspot'

    const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
      const handleViewProduct = async () => {
        // Assuming the user is logged in and you have their email
        const userEmail = localStorage.getItem('userEmail') // Replace with your actual logic

        if (!userEmail) {
          console.warn('User email not found.  Cannot track HubSpot event.')
          return
        }

        const eventProperties = {
          product_id: product.id,
          product_name: product.name,
          product_price: product.price,
          email: userEmail, // Very important!
        }

        const result = await trackHubspotEvent('product_viewed', eventProperties)

        if (result.success) {
          console.log('HubSpot event tracked successfully!')
        } else {
          console.error('Failed to track HubSpot event:', result.error)
        }
      }

      return (
        <div onClick={handleViewProduct}>
          <h3>{product.name}</h3>
          <p>${product.price}</p>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default ProductCard
    ```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `trackHubspotEvent` function from `lib/hubspot.js`.
- The `handleViewProduct` function is called when the user clicks on a product card.
- We construct an object containing the event properties. **Crucially, we include the user's email address.** This is essential for HubSpot to associate the event with a specific contact. You need to ensure you have a secure and reliable way to identify the user and retrieve their email address.
- We call the `trackHubspotEvent` function, passing the event name (`product_viewed`) and the event properties.
- We handle the success and error cases, logging messages to the console.

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

- **Security:** **Never expose your HubSpot API key in your client-side code.** Always use environment variables and access them server-side.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle API errors and provide informative messages to the user.
- **Data Validation:** Validate user input before submitting it to HubSpot to prevent errors and ensure data quality.
- **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of HubSpot's API rate limits. Implement strategies to avoid exceeding the limits, such as caching and queuing requests. The `next-hubspot` library does not automatically handle rate limiting, so you need to implement this yourself.
- **User Privacy:** Comply with all applicable privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. Obtain user consent before tracking their behavior. `next-hubspot` has functionalities to help with cookie and tracking consent. Review the package documentation for more details.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your integration to ensure that forms are submitted correctly and events are tracked accurately.
- **Documentation:** Refer to the official `next-hubspot` documentation for the most up-to-date information and advanced features.
- **GDPR Compliance:** Use HubSpot's GDPR-compliant features, such as double opt-in for subscriptions. Also, provide users with a clear way to manage their data and opt out of tracking.
- **Performance:** Minimize the impact of the integration on your website's performance. Avoid making unnecessary API calls and optimize your code.
- **Middleware:** You can use Next.js Middleware to intercept requests and perform tasks like:
  - Checking for HubSpot cookies and managing consent.
  - Redirecting users based on HubSpot data.
  - Adding custom headers to requests.

## Troubleshooting

- **"HubSpot client not initialized" Error:** Double-check that you have correctly configured your environment variables (`HUBSPOT_API_KEY`) and that you're initializing the `HubSpotClient` only on the server-side (using `typeof window === 'undefined'`).
- **Form Submission Errors:** Verify that the Portal ID and Form ID are correct. Check the HubSpot form settings to ensure that all required fields are present in your submission data.
- **Event Tracking Issues:** Make sure you're using the correct event name (as defined in HubSpot) and that you're including the user's email address as a property. Also, check the HubSpot activity log to see if the events are being recorded.
- **CORS Errors:** If you encounter CORS errors, ensure that your Next.js application's domain is whitelisted in your HubSpot account's CORS settings.

## Conclusion

Integrating HubSpot with your Next.js application using `next-hubspot` opens up a world of possibilities for automating your marketing efforts, enhancing customer engagement, and gaining valuable insights into user behavior. By following the steps outlined in this guide and adhering to the best practices, you can seamlessly connect your Next.js frontend to your HubSpot backend and unlock the full potential of your marketing data. Remember to prioritize security, user privacy, and performance to ensure a successful and sustainable integration.
