# Solving Systems of Linear Equations: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Solving systems of linear equations is a fundamental skill in mathematics, science, engineering, and computer science. It's used to model and solve problems in various fields, from circuit analysis to economic forecasting. This comprehensive guide explores different methods for solving these systems, providing clear explanations and practical examples.

## What is a System of Linear Equations?

A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations that involve the same variables. A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of any variable is 1. For example:

```
2x + y = 7
x - y = 2
```

This is a system of two linear equations with two variables (x and y).  The goal is to find values for x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

## Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations

Several methods can be used to solve systems of linear equations. We'll cover the most common and effective ones:

1.  **Substitution Method**
2.  **Elimination Method (also known as Addition Method)**
3.  **Gaussian Elimination**
4.  **Matrix Methods (using inverse matrices or Cramer's Rule)**

### 1. Substitution Method

The substitution method involves solving one equation for one variable and then substituting that expression into the other equation.  This reduces the system to a single equation with one variable, which can then be easily solved.

**Steps:**

1.  **Solve one equation for one variable:** Choose the equation and variable that is easiest to isolate.
2.  **Substitute:** Substitute the expression you found in step 1 into the *other* equation.
3.  **Solve for the remaining variable:** Solve the resulting equation for the single remaining variable.
4.  **Back-substitute:** Substitute the value you found in step 3 back into either of the original equations (or the expression from step 1) to solve for the other variable.
5.  **Check your solution:**  Verify that your values for x and y satisfy both original equations.

**Example:**

Solve the following system of equations using substitution:

```
x + y = 5
2x - y = 1
```

**Solution:**

1.  **Solve for x in the first equation:**  `x = 5 - y`
2.  **Substitute:** Substitute `(5 - y)` for x in the second equation:  `2(5 - y) - y = 1`
3.  **Solve for y:** Simplify and solve: `10 - 2y - y = 1  =>  10 - 3y = 1  =>  -3y = -9  =>  y = 3`
4.  **Back-substitute:** Substitute `y = 3` back into `x = 5 - y`: `x = 5 - 3  =>  x = 2`
5.  **Check:** `2 + 3 = 5` and `2(2) - 3 = 1`. Both equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the solution is `x = 2` and `y = 3`.

### 2. Elimination Method (Addition Method)

The elimination method involves manipulating the equations so that when they are added together, one of the variables is eliminated.

**Steps:**

1.  **Multiply equations (if necessary):** Multiply one or both equations by a constant so that the coefficients of one of the variables are opposites.
2.  **Add the equations:** Add the two equations together. The variable with opposite coefficients will be eliminated.
3.  **Solve for the remaining variable:** Solve the resulting equation for the single remaining variable.
4.  **Back-substitute:** Substitute the value you found in step 3 back into either of the original equations to solve for the other variable.
5.  **Check your solution:** Verify that your values for x and y satisfy both original equations.

**Example:**

Solve the following system of equations using elimination:

```
3x + 2y = 7
x - 2y = -1
```

**Solution:**

1.  **Multiply equations (not necessary in this case):**  The coefficients of y are already opposites (+2 and -2).
2.  **Add the equations:** Add the two equations together:

    ```
    3x + 2y = 7
    x - 2y = -1
    -----------
    4x      = 6
    ```
3.  **Solve for x:** `4x = 6  =>  x = 6/4  =>  x = 3/2`
4.  **Back-substitute:** Substitute `x = 3/2` back into the first equation: `3(3/2) + 2y = 7  =>  9/2 + 2y = 7  =>  2y = 7 - 9/2  => 2y = 5/2  => y = 5/4`
5.  **Check:** `3(3/2) + 2(5/4) = 9/2 + 5/2 = 14/2 = 7` and `3/2 - 2(5/4) = 3/2 - 5/2 = -2/2 = -1`. Both equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the solution is `x = 3/2` and `y = 5/4`.

### 3. Gaussian Elimination

Gaussian elimination is a systematic method for solving systems of linear equations by transforming the system's augmented matrix into row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF). This method is particularly useful for larger systems of equations.

**Steps:**

1.  **Write the augmented matrix:** Represent the system of equations as an augmented matrix.  The coefficients of the variables form the left side of the matrix, and the constants on the right side of the equations form the rightmost column.
2.  **Perform row operations:** Use elementary row operations to transform the matrix into row echelon form (REF) or reduced row echelon form (RREF).  The three elementary row operations are:
    *   **Swapping rows:** Interchange two rows.
    *   **Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant:** Multiply all entries in a row by a non-zero constant.
    *   **Adding a multiple of one row to another row:** Add a multiple of one row to another row.
3.  **Back-substitution (if in REF):**  If the matrix is in REF, use back-substitution to solve for the variables.
4.  **Read the solution directly (if in RREF):** If the matrix is in RREF, the solution can be read directly from the matrix.

**Example:**

Solve the following system of equations using Gaussian elimination:

```
x + y + z = 6
2x - y + z = 3
x + 2y - z = 2
```

**Solution:**

1.  **Augmented matrix:**

    ```
    [ 1  1  1 | 6 ]
    [ 2 -1  1 | 3 ]
    [ 1  2 -1 | 2 ]
    ```
2.  **Row operations (transform to RREF):**

    *   R2 = R2 - 2\*R1:
        ```
        [ 1  1  1 | 6 ]
        [ 0 -3 -1 | -9 ]
        [ 1  2 -1 | 2 ]
        ```
    *   R3 = R3 - R1:
        ```
        [ 1  1  1 | 6 ]
        [ 0 -3 -1 | -9 ]
        [ 0  1 -2 | -4 ]
        ```
    *   R2 = R2 / -3:
        ```
        [ 1  1  1 | 6 ]
        [ 0  1  1/3 | 3 ]
        [ 0  1 -2 | -4 ]
        ```
    *   R3 = R3 - R2:
        ```
        [ 1  1  1 | 6 ]
        [ 0  1  1/3 | 3 ]
        [ 0  0 -7/3 | -7 ]
        ```
    *   R3 = R3 * -3/7:
        ```
        [ 1  1  1 | 6 ]
        [ 0  1  1/3 | 3 ]
        [ 0  0  1 | 3 ]
        ```
    *   R2 = R2 - 1/3 * R3:
        ```
        [ 1  1  1 | 6 ]
        [ 0  1  0 | 2 ]
        [ 0  0  1 | 3 ]
        ```
    *   R1 = R1 - R3:
        ```
        [ 1  1  0 | 3 ]
        [ 0  1  0 | 2 ]
        [ 0  0  1 | 3 ]
        ```
    *   R1 = R1 - R2:
        ```
        [ 1  0  0 | 1 ]
        [ 0  1  0 | 2 ]
        [ 0  0  1 | 3 ]
        ```

3.  **Solution:** The matrix is now in RREF. We can directly read the solution: `x = 1`, `y = 2`, `z = 3`.

### 4. Matrix Methods

Matrix methods involve using matrices to represent and solve systems of linear equations. Two common matrix methods are:

*   **Using the Inverse Matrix:** This method is applicable when the coefficient matrix is square and invertible.
*   **Cramer's Rule:** This method is useful for solving systems with a unique solution, especially when the number of equations and variables is small.

#### a. Using the Inverse Matrix

If we have a system of linear equations represented as `Ax = b`, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector, then if A is invertible, the solution is given by `x = A⁻¹b`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Represent the system as `Ax = b`:** Identify the coefficient matrix (A), the variable vector (x), and the constant vector (b).
2.  **Find the inverse of A (A⁻¹):** Calculate the inverse of the coefficient matrix. This can be done using various methods, such as Gaussian elimination or adjugate method.
3.  **Calculate `x = A⁻¹b`:** Multiply the inverse of A by the constant vector b to obtain the solution vector x.

**Example (Conceptual - Finding the inverse can be complex):**

Suppose we have the system:

```
x + y = 3
x - y = 1
```

1.  **Matrix representation:**

    ```
    A = [ 1  1 ]
        [ 1 -1 ]

    x = [ x ]
        [ y ]

    b = [ 3 ]
        [ 1 ]
    ```

2.  **Find A⁻¹ (for demonstration purposes, let's assume we found it):**

    ```
    A⁻¹ = [ 1/2  1/2 ]
          [ 1/2 -1/2 ]
    ```

3.  **Calculate `x = A⁻¹b`:**

    ```
    x = [ 1/2  1/2 ] [ 3 ] = [ (1/2)*3 + (1/2)*1 ] = [ 2 ]
        [ 1/2 -1/2 ] [ 1 ]   [ (1/2)*3 + (-1/2)*1 ]   [ 1 ]
    ```

Therefore, `x = 2` and `y = 1`.

#### b. Cramer's Rule

Cramer's Rule provides a direct method for solving systems of linear equations using determinants.

**Steps:**

1.  **Calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):** Find the determinant of the matrix A.
2.  **Calculate the determinants `D_x`, `D_y`, etc.:** For each variable, replace the corresponding column in the coefficient matrix with the constant vector `b` and calculate the determinant of the resulting matrix.
3.  **Solve for the variables:**  `x = D_x / D`, `y = D_y / D`, etc.

**Example:**

Solve the following system of equations using Cramer's Rule:

```
2x + y = 7
x - y = 2
```

**Solution:**

1.  **Determinant of the coefficient matrix (D):**

    ```
    A = [ 2  1 ]
        [ 1 -1 ]

    D = (2 * -1) - (1 * 1) = -2 - 1 = -3
    ```

2.  **Determinants `D_x` and `D_y`:**

    ```
    D_x = [ 7  1 ]
          [ 2 -1 ] = (7 * -1) - (1 * 2) = -7 - 2 = -9

    D_y = [ 2  7 ]
          [ 1  2 ] = (2 * 2) - (7 * 1) = 4 - 7 = -3
    ```

3.  **Solve for x and y:**

    ```
    x = D_x / D = -9 / -3 = 3
    y = D_y / D = -3 / -3 = 1
    ```

Therefore, `x = 3` and `y = 1`.

## Code Examples (Python)

Here's how you can solve systems of linear equations using Python with the `numpy` library:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example system of equations:
# 2x + y = 7
# x - y = 2

# Coefficient matrix
A = np.array([[2, 1], [1, -1]])

# Constant vector
b = np.array([7, 2])

# Solve the system
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

print("Solution:")
print(f"x = {x[0]}")
print(f"y = {x[1]}")

# Gaussian Elimination (using SciPy)
from scipy.linalg import solve

A = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [2, -1, 1], [1, 2, -1]])  # Coefficients
b = np.array([6, 3, 2])                           # Constants

x = solve(A, b)

print(f"Solution using Scipy: x={x[0]}, y={x[1]}, z={x[2]}")
```

## Special Cases

*   **No Solution:**  If the equations represent parallel lines (in 2D) or planes (in 3D) and do not intersect, the system has no solution. In Gaussian elimination, this will manifest as a row of zeros with a non-zero constant on the right side of the augmented matrix.
*   **Infinite Solutions:** If the equations are dependent (represent the same line or plane), the system has infinitely many solutions. In Gaussian elimination, this will manifest as a row of zeros in the augmented matrix.
*   **Unique Solution:** This is the typical case where the system has exactly one solution.
