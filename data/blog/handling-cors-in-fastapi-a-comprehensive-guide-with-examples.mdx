# Handling CORS in FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial security mechanism implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one which served the web page. Without proper CORS configuration, your FastAPI API might face issues when accessed from web applications running on different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). This guide will walk you through understanding CORS, why it's important, and how to configure it effectively in your FastAPI applications.

## What is CORS and Why is it Important?

Imagine a scenario where you're logged into your bank's website. Without CORS, a malicious website could potentially make requests to your bank's API (using your credentials stored in cookies) and perform actions on your behalf, like transferring funds. CORS prevents this by ensuring that only trusted origins can make requests to your API.

In simpler terms:

- **Origin:** An origin is defined by the combination of the protocol (e.g., `http`, `https`), domain (e.g., `example.com`), and port (e.g., `80`, `443`).
- **Same-Origin Policy:** Browsers enforce the same-origin policy, which means a script running on `https://example.com` can only make requests to `https://example.com`.
- **CORS:** CORS provides a mechanism for the server to tell the browser that it's safe to allow requests from specific origins, even if they're different from the server's origin.

## CORS in FastAPI: `starlette.middleware.cors`

FastAPI utilizes the `starlette.middleware.cors` middleware to handle CORS. This middleware adds the necessary HTTP headers to responses, instructing the browser whether to allow requests from other origins.

### Installing `starlette.middleware.cors`

If you're using FastAPI, you already have `starlette` installed as a dependency. However, it's always good to double-check:

```plaintext
pip install starlette
```

### Basic CORS Configuration

Here's a basic example of how to enable CORS in your FastAPI application, allowing requests from any origin (which is often suitable for development but should be carefully considered for production):

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

origins = [
    "http://localhost",
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8000", # Important for local development
    "https://your-frontend-domain.com", # Add your frontend domain(s)
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins, # Allow specific origins or ["*"] for all origins in development
    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies to be sent in cross-origin requests
    allow_methods=["*"],     # Allow all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    allow_headers=["*"],     # Allow all headers
)


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

```

**Explanation:**

- `from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware`: Imports the necessary CORS middleware.
- `origins`: A list of origins that are allowed to make requests to your API. In the example above, we've included common development origins and a placeholder for your actual frontend domain.
  - **Important Security Note:** Avoid using `["*"]` in production unless you truly understand the implications. It effectively disables CORS protection and makes your API vulnerable. Specify explicitly the allowed origins.
- `app.add_middleware(...)`: Adds the CORS middleware to your FastAPI application. It's crucial to add this middleware **before** any other middleware that might interact with the request or response headers.
- `allow_origins=origins`: Specifies the list of allowed origins.
- `allow_credentials=True`: Allows cross-origin requests to include credentials such as cookies, authorization headers, and TLS client certificates. This is important if your API requires authentication.
- `allow_methods=["*"]`: Allows all HTTP methods. You can restrict this to specific methods like `["GET", "POST", "PUT"]` for tighter security.
- `allow_headers=["*"]`: Allows all HTTP headers. You can restrict this to specific headers, like `["Content-Type", "Authorization"]`.

### More Granular CORS Configuration

For a more secure and controlled setup, you should define specific allowed origins, methods, and headers. Here's an example:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

origins = [
    "https://your-frontend-domain.com",
    "https://another-frontend-domain.com",
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"], # Restrict to specific methods
    allow_headers=["Content-Type", "Authorization", "Accept"],  # Restrict to specific headers
)

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item_name: str):
  return {"message": f"Item {item_name} created"}
```

**Key Considerations for Production Environments:**

- **Specify Allowed Origins:** Never use `["*"]` in production. Always list the exact origins that are allowed to access your API.
- **Restrict Allowed Methods:** Only allow the HTTP methods that your API actually uses (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). Disabling unused methods reduces the attack surface. Include `OPTIONS` if you need to support preflight requests for complex CORS scenarios.
- **Restrict Allowed Headers:** Only allow the headers that your API actually needs. The `Content-Type` and `Authorization` headers are common, but be careful about allowing arbitrary headers.
- **`allow_credentials=True` with Caution:** If you're using credentials (e.g., cookies, HTTP authentication), you **must** also set `allow_origins` to a specific list of origins (not `["*"]`). This is a security requirement to prevent malicious sites from accessing your users' credentials.

### Handling Preflight Requests (OPTIONS)

Browsers often send "preflight" `OPTIONS` requests to the server before making the actual request, especially for complex CORS requests (e.g., those using custom headers or methods other than `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST` with `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`). The browser uses the response to this preflight request to determine if the actual request will be allowed.

The `CORSMiddleware` automatically handles `OPTIONS` requests. You don't need to define explicit routes for them. The middleware checks if the origin, method, and headers of the preflight request are allowed based on your configuration and sends the appropriate `Access-Control-*` headers.

### Example with Environment Variables

For greater flexibility, you can load your CORS configuration from environment variables:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import os

app = FastAPI()

origins_str = os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "http://localhost,http://localhost:8080")
origins = [origin.strip() for origin in origins_str.split(",")]


app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

In this example, the allowed origins are read from the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. You can set this variable in your deployment environment or in a `.env` file (using a library like `python-dotenv`). This makes it easier to configure your CORS settings without modifying your code.

### Troubleshooting CORS Issues

If you encounter CORS errors in your browser's console (e.g., "has been blocked by CORS policy"), here are some common causes and solutions:

1.  **Incorrect `allow_origins`:** Double-check that the origin making the request is included in your `allow_origins` list. Pay attention to the protocol (http vs. https) and port.
2.  **Missing `allow_credentials`:** If your API requires credentials, ensure that `allow_credentials` is set to `True`. Also, remember that you can't use `["*"]` for `allow_origins` when `allow_credentials` is `True`.
3.  **Missing or Incorrect Headers:** Make sure that the request includes the necessary headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`), and that your `allow_headers` list allows them.
4.  **Server-Side Caching:** If you're using a caching mechanism (e.g., Cloudflare, Varnish), ensure that it's not caching the CORS headers incorrectly. You might need to configure your cache to pass through the CORS headers.
5.  **Proxy Issues:** If your requests are going through a proxy server, make sure that the proxy is forwarding the necessary headers.
6.  **Browser Extensions:** Sometimes browser extensions can interfere with CORS. Try disabling extensions to see if that resolves the issue.
7.  **Preflight request failing:** Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see if the preflight `OPTIONS` request is failing. The error message should provide clues about what's wrong. Common issues include:
    - The server doesn't respond to `OPTIONS` requests correctly. (FastAPI's `CORSMiddleware` should handle this automatically)
    - The `Access-Control-Request-Method` and `Access-Control-Request-Headers` headers in the `OPTIONS` request are not allowed by the server.

### Best Practices for CORS in FastAPI

- **Be Explicit:** Always be as explicit as possible in your CORS configuration. Avoid wildcarding (`["*"]`) unless you have a very specific reason to do so and understand the security implications.
- **Secure Your Origins:** Only allow origins that you trust. If you're working with third-party APIs, carefully review their CORS policies.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store your CORS configuration in environment variables to make it easier to manage your settings across different environments.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your CORS configuration thoroughly in different browsers and scenarios to ensure that it's working as expected.
- **Monitor and Log:** Monitor your API for CORS errors and log any suspicious activity.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively handle CORS in your FastAPI applications and ensure secure and reliable communication between your API and your frontends. Remember to prioritize security and always be mindful of the potential risks associated with allowing cross-origin requests.
