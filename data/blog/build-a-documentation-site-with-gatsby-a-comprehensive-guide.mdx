# Build a Documentation Site with Gatsby: A Comprehensive Guide

Creating clear, concise, and accessible documentation is crucial for any successful project, whether it's an open-source library, a software product, or internal tools. Gatsby, a powerful static site generator built on React, coupled with MDX, which lets you write JSX inside Markdown, makes building a professional-looking documentation site surprisingly straightforward. This guide walks you through the entire process, from initial setup to deployment.

## Why Gatsby for Documentation?

Gatsby offers several advantages for building documentation sites:

- **Performance:** Gatsby pre-renders your site at build time, resulting in blazing-fast page load speeds.
- **SEO-Friendly:** Gatsby generates static HTML pages optimized for search engines.
- **MDX Support:** MDX allows you to seamlessly integrate React components into your documentation, enhancing interactivity and visual appeal.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** A vast ecosystem of plugins and themes simplifies common tasks like image optimization, SEO, and more.
- **Flexibility:** Gatsby is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the look and feel of your documentation site to match your brand.
- **GraphQL Data Layer:** Gatsby leverages GraphQL to efficiently fetch and manage your content.
- **Scalability:** Gatsby handles large documentation projects efficiently due to its static nature and performance optimizations.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** (Version 14 or higher is recommended) - You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or Yarn:** (npm comes with Node.js) - Yarn is an alternative package manager: [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- **Basic knowledge of React and Markdown:** While not strictly necessary, a basic understanding of React components and Markdown syntax will be helpful.

## Step 1: Setting Up a New Gatsby Project

Let's start by creating a new Gatsby project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
gatsby new my-docs-site
cd my-docs-site
```

This command will create a new Gatsby project named "my-docs-site" and navigate you into the project directory. You can choose a starter template during the `gatsby new` process. For a basic documentation setup, the default starter is sufficient. If you're looking for a more feature-rich starting point, consider using a Gatsby theme specifically designed for documentation, such as `gatsby-theme-docz` or `gatsby-theme-mdx-deck`. However, for this guide, we will build from scratch for maximum control and understanding.

## Step 2: Installing Necessary Dependencies

Next, we need to install the packages required for working with MDX:

```plaintext
npm install @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-plugin-mdx gatsby-source-filesystem
```

Here's a breakdown of these packages:

- **`@mdx-js/mdx`:** The core MDX compiler.
- **`@mdx-js/react`:** Provides the necessary components for rendering MDX content in React.
- **`gatsby-plugin-mdx`:** A Gatsby plugin that integrates MDX into your Gatsby build process.
- **`gatsby-source-filesystem`:** A Gatsby plugin that allows you to source data from the file system (where your MDX files will be stored).

## Step 3: Configuring `gatsby-config.js`

Now, let's configure the `gatsby-config.js` file to enable the plugins we just installed and tell Gatsby where to find our MDX files. Open `gatsby-config.js` and add the following configuration:

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Awesome Documentation`,
    description: `A comprehensive documentation site.`,
    author: `Your Name`,
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `docs`, // Or any name you prefer
        path: `${__dirname}/src/docs`, // Path to your MDX files
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`,
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`siteMetadata`:** Contains metadata about your site, which can be accessed in your components. This is useful for setting the site title, description, and other global information.
- **`gatsby-plugin-mdx`:** Enables MDX support in your Gatsby project.
- **`gatsby-source-filesystem`:** Configures Gatsby to read files from the `src/docs` directory (which we will create in the next step). You can name the "name" option to anything you like, such as "pages" or "blog". The `path` option specifies the directory containing your MDX files. `__dirname` refers to the root directory of your Gatsby project.
- **`gatsby-plugin-image`, `gatsby-plugin-sharp`, `gatsby-transformer-sharp`:** These plugins handle image processing and optimization. They're crucial for a fast and accessible documentation site. They often work together so make sure to include all three to get them to work correctly.
- **`gatsby-plugin-styled-components`:** To use styled components and CSS-in-JS. This gives a lot of freedom and great developer experience.

## Step 4: Creating a `docs` Directory and MDX Files

Create a directory named `src/docs` in your project. This is where you will store your documentation files. Inside the `src/docs` directory, create a few MDX files, such as `getting-started.mdx` and `api-reference.mdx`.

Here's an example `getting-started.mdx` file:

````plaintext
---
title: Getting Started
slug: /getting-started
---

# Getting Started with My Awesome Library

Welcome to the documentation for My Awesome Library! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## Installation

To install the library, use npm:

```plaintext
npm install my-awesome-library
```
````

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the library:

```plaintext
import { awesomeFunction } from 'my-awesome-library'

const result = awesomeFunction('Hello, world!')
console.log(result)
```

<MyReactComponent />

````

Here's an example `api-reference.mdx` file:

```plaintext
---
title: API Reference
slug: /api-reference
---

# API Reference

This section provides a detailed API reference for My Awesome Library.

## `awesomeFunction(input: string): string`

This function does something amazing.

**Parameters:**

*   `input`: A string input.

**Returns:**

A modified string.
````

Notice the frontmatter at the top of each MDX file. This is where you define metadata for your documentation pages, such as the title and slug. The `slug` will be used to generate the URL for the page. We'll use it in the next step when we're building pages programmatically.

## Step 5: Creating Pages Programmatically with `gatsby-node.js`

Gatsby uses the `gatsby-node.js` file to customize the build process. We'll use it to programmatically create pages from our MDX files. Create a file named `gatsby-node.js` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```plaintext
const path = require('path')

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions, reporter }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions

  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx {
        nodes {
          id
          frontmatter {
            slug
          }
          internal {
            contentFilePath
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  if (result.errors) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild('Error loading MDX result', result.errors)
  }

  // Create blog post pages.
  const docs = result.data.allMdx.nodes

  // you'll call `createPage` for each result
  docs.forEach((node) => {
    createPage({
      path: node.frontmatter.slug,
      component: path.resolve(`./src/components/DocPageLayout.js`),
      context: { id: node.id },
    })
  })
}

exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        '@components': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/components'),
        '@styles': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/styles'),
        '@images': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/images'),
        '@utils': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/utils'),
      },
    },
  })
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`createPages`:** This function is called by Gatsby during the build process.
- **`graphql`:** This function allows you to query your data using GraphQL. We're querying all MDX nodes and retrieving their `id`, `slug` and `contentFilePath`.
- **`actions.createPage`:** This function creates a new page in your Gatsby site. We're creating a page for each MDX file.
  - **`path`:** The URL path for the page (taken from the `slug` frontmatter).
  - **`component`:** The React component that will render the page. We'll create this component in the next step.
  - **`context`:** A context object that will be passed to the component. We're passing the `id` of the MDX node.
- **`onCreateWebpackConfig`:** Defines aliases for commonly used directories. This can reduce repetition and make code more readable.

## Step 6: Creating a Page Layout Component (`DocPageLayout.js`)

Now, let's create the `DocPageLayout.js` component that will render our MDX content. Create a directory named `src/components` and a file named `DocPageLayout.js` inside it. Add the following code:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
import Layout from '../components/layout' // Assuming you have a layout component

export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      frontmatter {
        title
      }
      body
    }
  }
`

const DocPageLayout = ({ data }) => {
  const { mdx } = data

  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>{mdx.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXRenderer>{mdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default DocPageLayout
```

**Explanation:**

- **`graphql`:** This function allows you to query your data using GraphQL. We're querying the MDX node with the ID that we passed in the `context` object in `gatsby-node.js`.
- **`MDXRenderer`:** This component renders the MDX content. It takes the `body` of the MDX node as a prop.
- **`Layout`:** This refers to a layout component for your entire site. This is assumed to be in `/src/components/layout.js` You can create one of your own if you don't already have one.

Here's an example for what `layout.js` may look like:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/getting-started">Getting Started</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/api-reference">API Reference</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Layout
```

**Important:** This assumes you've created a `layout.js` file in `/src/components/`. This file serves as a container for common page elements like a header, footer, or navigation. You can customize this to match your desired site structure and theme.

## Step 7: Add a `gatsby-browser.js` file.

Some of the code uses React so we need to make sure to add `@mdx-js/react` in this file to let it know.

```js
import React from 'react'

export const wrapRootElement = ({ element }) => <>{element}</>
```

## Step 8: Running the Development Server

Now, you can start the Gatsby development server:

```plaintext
gatsby develop
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:8000`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/getting-started` and `http://localhost:8000/api-reference` to see your documentation pages.

## Step 9: Adding a Navigation Menu

A good navigation menu is essential for any documentation site. You can create a navigation menu by querying all MDX files and listing their titles and slugs. Update your `Layout.js` component to include a navigation menu:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { Link, useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby'

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      allMdx {
        nodes {
          frontmatter {
            title
            slug
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  const docs = data.allMdx.nodes

  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          {docs.map((doc) => (
            <li key={doc.frontmatter.slug}>
              <Link to={doc.frontmatter.slug}>{doc.frontmatter.title}</Link>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Layout
```

**Explanation:**

- **`useStaticQuery`:** A hook that allows you to query data in your components. We're querying all MDX nodes and retrieving their `title` and `slug`.
- We're mapping over the MDX nodes and creating a `Link` for each one. The `to` prop of the `Link` component is set to the `slug` of the MDX node.

## Step 10: Customizing the Theme

Gatsby offers a great level of customisation. You can customize the theme of your documentation site by:

- **Using a Gatsby theme:** There are many Gatsby themes available that are specifically designed for documentation sites. These themes provide a pre-built look and feel for your site, which you can then customize to match your brand.
- **Using CSS or Styled Components:** You can use CSS or Styled Components to style your components. Styled components are a great solution for CSS-in-JS, which gives a better developer experience.
- **Overriding theme components:** If you're using a Gatsby theme, you can override its components to customize their behavior.

## Step 11: Adding Search Functionality

Search functionality is crucial for large documentation sites. You can add search to your Gatsby site using plugins like `gatsby-plugin-local-search` or by integrating with a third-party search provider like Algolia or MeiliSearch.

Here's a basic example using `gatsby-plugin-local-search`:

1.  **Install the plugin:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install gatsby-plugin-local-search lunr
    ```

2.  **Configure `gatsby-config.js`:**

    ```plaintext
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        // ... other plugins
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-plugin-local-search`,
          options: {
            name: `docs`,
            engine: `lunr`,
            query: `
              {
                allMdx {
                  nodes {
                    id
                    frontmatter {
                      title
                      slug
                    }
                    body
                  }
                }
              }
            `,
            ref: `id`,
            index: [`title`, `body`],
            store: [`id`, `title`, `slug`],
            normalizer: ({ data }) =>
              data.allMdx.nodes.map((node) => ({
                id: node.id,
                title: node.frontmatter.title,
                slug: node.frontmatter.slug,
                body: node.body,
              })),
          },
        },
      ],
    }
    ```

3.  **Create a Search Component:** You'll need to create a React component that uses the `useSearchIndex` hook provided by the plugin to perform the search and display the results. This will involve creating a search input and displaying results based on the search term.

## Step 12: Deployment

Once you're happy with your documentation site, you can deploy it to a hosting platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Gatsby generates static HTML files, making it easy to deploy to any static hosting provider.

## Best Practices for Documentation Sites

- **Keep it Concise and Clear:** Use simple language and avoid jargon.
- **Provide Code Examples:** Illustrate concepts with practical code examples.
- **Use Visual Aids:** Incorporate images, diagrams, and videos to enhance understanding.
- **Organize Content Logically:** Structure your documentation in a way that makes it easy for users to find the information they need.
- **Keep it Up-to-Date:** Regularly review and update your documentation to reflect changes in your project.
- **Enable Feedback:** Provide a way for users to provide feedback on your documentation. This can be a simple contact form or a more sophisticated commenting system.
- **Use a Consistent Style:** Maintain a consistent style throughout your documentation to ensure a professional and cohesive look and feel.

## Conclusion

Building a documentation site with Gatsby and MDX is a powerful and flexible solution. By leveraging Gatsby's performance, MDX's versatility, and a well-structured project, you can create a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for your users. Remember to focus on clarity, consistency, and maintainability to ensure your documentation remains valuable over time. Good documentation is an investment that pays dividends in user satisfaction and project success.
