# Git Hooks for CI/CD: Automating Your Development Workflow

Git hooks are powerful tools that allow you to run custom scripts before or after certain Git events, such as committing, pushing, or merging. They provide a way to automate tasks within your development workflow, improving code quality, enforcing standards, and streamlining the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) process. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on using Git hooks for CI/CD, offering practical examples and explanations.

## What are Git Hooks?

Git hooks are scripts located in the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository.  These scripts are triggered by specific Git actions.  Out of the box, Git provides sample hook scripts (with a `.sample` extension) demonstrating how to use them. To enable a hook, you simply remove the `.sample` extension and make the script executable.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Triggers:** Hooks are triggered by Git actions like `commit`, `push`, `merge`, etc.
*   **Scripts:** Hooks are scripts written in any scripting language (Bash, Python, Node.js, Ruby, etc.) as long as the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`, `#!/usr/bin/env python`, etc.) is correct for execution.
*   **Location:** Stored in the `.git/hooks` directory of your local Git repository. This means they are **not** version controlled and exist only locally. For shared hooks across a team, consider tools like `husky` or `lefthook` (covered later).
*   **Exit Codes:** Hooks influence Git's behavior. A non-zero exit code (e.g., `exit 1`) from a `pre-commit` hook will prevent the commit from occurring. A zero exit code (e.g., `exit 0`) allows the action to proceed.

## Types of Git Hooks

Git provides various hooks, but some are more commonly used for CI/CD pipelines than others. Here are some of the most relevant:

*   **`pre-commit`:**  Runs *before* a commit is created.  Ideal for code linters, formatters, and basic testing to ensure code quality before committing changes.  If this hook exits with a non-zero status, the commit is aborted.
*   **`prepare-commit-msg`:** Runs *before* the commit message editor is launched, allowing you to modify the commit message programmatically. Useful for adding issue IDs or enforcing commit message conventions.
*   **`commit-msg`:**  Runs *after* the commit message is entered. Useful for validating the commit message format.  If this hook exits with a non-zero status, the commit is aborted.
*   **`post-commit`:** Runs *after* a commit is created.  Useful for notification systems or triggering other actions *after* a commit is successful.  This hook doesn't affect the commit itself.
*   **`pre-push`:** Runs *before* pushing commits to a remote repository. Ideal for running more comprehensive tests, checking for sensitive data, or ensuring the remote branch is in a good state. If this hook exits with a non-zero status, the push is aborted.
*   **`post-receive`:** Runs on the remote repository *after* a push has been received. Useful for triggering CI/CD pipelines, deploying code, or sending notifications about successful updates. This hook runs on the server, not the client.
*   **`post-update`:**  Similar to `post-receive`, but runs *after* the references are updated.

## Setting Up Git Hooks: Practical Examples

Let's dive into some practical examples of how to use Git hooks for common CI/CD tasks.

### 1. `pre-commit` Hook: Linting and Formatting

This example uses `eslint` and `prettier` to lint and format JavaScript code before each commit.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm installed.
*   `eslint` and `prettier` installed as dev dependencies in your project:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
    ```

*   `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` configuration files set up in your project root.

**`pre-commit` script (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if eslint and prettier are installed
if ! command -v eslint &> /dev/null
then
    echo "eslint not found. Please install it (npm install --save-dev eslint)"
    exit 1
fi

if ! command -v prettier &> /dev/null
then
    echo "prettier not found. Please install it (npm install --save-dev prettier)"
    exit 1
fi

# Staged files
staged_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR)

# Loop through staged JavaScript files and lint and format them
for file in $staged_files; do
    if [[ $file == *.js || $file == *.jsx || $file == *.ts || $file == *.tsx ]]; then
        echo "Linting and formatting: $file"
        eslint --fix "$file"
        prettier --write "$file"
        git add "$file" # Stage the changes made by eslint and prettier
    fi
done

# If any linting or formatting changes were made, fail the commit.  This forces developers
# to ensure their code is clean before committing.  You can comment this out if you prefer
# to automatically fix and commit changes.
if git diff --staged --quiet; then
  echo "No linting or formatting issues found."
  exit 0
else
  echo "Linting or formatting changes were made. Please review and commit."
  exit 1
fi
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Shebang:** `#!/bin/bash` specifies the script interpreter.
2.  **Check for Dependencies:**  Ensures `eslint` and `prettier` are installed.
3.  **Staged Files:** Uses `git diff --cached` to get a list of staged files.
4.  **Looping and Processing:** Iterates through the staged files, and if the file extension is `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx`, it runs `eslint --fix` (which automatically fixes linting errors) and `prettier --write` (which formats the code according to the configuration).
5.  **Staging Changes:**  `git add "$file"` stages the changes made by `eslint` and `prettier`.  This is crucial; otherwise, the changes made by the hook won't be included in the commit.
6.  **Checking for Changes:**  `git diff --staged --quiet` checks if there are any differences between the staged files and the last commit. If there are no differences, the script exits with a zero status code (success).  If there *are* differences (meaning `eslint` or `prettier` made changes), the script exits with a non-zero status code (failure), preventing the commit.

**Important:** Make the script executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

### 2. `commit-msg` Hook: Enforcing Commit Message Conventions

This example enforces a basic commit message convention (e.g., including a ticket ID).

**`commit-msg` script (`.git/hooks/commit-msg`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

COMMIT_MSG_FILE="$1"
COMMIT_MSG=$(cat "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE")

# Check if the commit message starts with a ticket ID (e.g., JIRA-123)
if ! [[ "$COMMIT_MSG" =~ ^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+.* ]]; then
  echo "Error: Commit message must start with a ticket ID (e.g., JIRA-123)."
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`COMMIT_MSG_FILE`:**  The first argument to the `commit-msg` hook is the path to the file containing the commit message.
2.  **`COMMIT_MSG`:** Reads the commit message from the file.
3.  **Regular Expression:** Uses a regular expression (`^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+.*`) to check if the commit message starts with a ticket ID (uppercase letters, a hyphen, and numbers).
4.  **Exit Code:** Exits with a non-zero status code if the commit message doesn't match the convention, preventing the commit.

**Important:** Make the script executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg`

### 3. `pre-push` Hook: Running Tests Before Pushing

This example runs your project's test suite before allowing you to push your commits to a remote repository.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Your project has a test suite and a command to run the tests (e.g., `npm test`, `yarn test`, `pytest`).

**`pre-push` script (`.git/hooks/pre-push`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if tests pass
echo "Running tests..."
if ! npm test; then
  echo "Tests failed. Aborting push."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Tests passed. Continuing with push."
exit 0
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`npm test`:**  This line executes your project's test suite. Replace `npm test` with the appropriate command for your project (e.g., `yarn test`, `pytest`).
2.  **Exit Code:** Exits with a non-zero status code if the tests fail, preventing the push.

**Important:** Make the script executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`

### 4. `post-receive` Hook: Triggering CI/CD Pipeline

This hook runs on the *remote* repository (e.g., your Git server). It's typically used to trigger CI/CD pipelines after a successful push.

**`post-receive` script (on the remote server):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while read oldrev newrev ref
do
  branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $ref)
  if [ "$branch" = "main" ]; then  # Or "master" or your main branch name
    echo "Main branch updated. Triggering CI/CD pipeline..."
    # Replace with your CI/CD trigger command
    # Example using curl to trigger a webhook:
    curl -X POST https://your-ci-server.com/webhook
  fi
done
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`while read oldrev newrev ref`:**  This loop iterates through the references that were updated.
2.  **`branch=$(git rev-parse ...)`:** Extracts the branch name from the reference.
3.  **`if [ "$branch" = "main" ]`:**  Checks if the updated branch is the main branch (e.g., `main`, `master`).  You should modify this to match your project's main branch.
4.  **`curl -X POST ...`:**  This is where you trigger your CI/CD pipeline. Replace `https://your-ci-server.com/webhook` with the actual URL of your CI/CD webhook. Other CI/CD systems might use different commands or APIs to trigger pipelines.

**Important Considerations for `post-receive`:**

*   **Remote Server:**  This hook needs to be placed in the `.git/hooks` directory of your *remote* Git repository (on the server).
*   **Permissions:** Ensure the script has execute permissions and that the user running the Git server (often `git`) has the necessary permissions to execute the commands within the script (e.g., `curl`).
*   **Security:** Be mindful of the commands you run in the `post-receive` hook.  Avoid running commands that could compromise the security of your server. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling to ensure the pipeline is triggered reliably and that you receive notifications if something goes wrong.

## Shared Git Hooks: `husky` and `lefthook`

As mentioned earlier, Git hooks are not version controlled by default. This means that each developer needs to manually set up the hooks in their local repository.  This can be cumbersome and error-prone. To solve this, tools like `husky` and `lefthook` are used to manage and share Git hooks across a team.

### `husky`

`husky` is a popular tool that allows you to easily define Git hooks in your `package.json` file.  It simplifies the process of sharing and installing hooks.

**Installation and Usage:**

1.  **Install `husky`:**

    ```bash
    npm install husky --save-dev
    ```

2.  **Enable Git hooks:**

    ```bash
    npx husky install
    ```

3.  **Define hooks in `package.json`:**

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "prepare": "husky install"
      },
      "husky": {
        "hooks": {
          "pre-commit": "npm run lint && npm run format"
        }
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "husky": "^8.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `pre-commit` hook will run the `lint` and `format` scripts defined in your `package.json`. You'll likely need to define these scripts in your `package.json` as well.

4.  **Commit the changes:**  Commit the updated `package.json` and the `.husky` directory to your repository.

Now, when other developers clone the repository and run `npm install`, `husky` will automatically install the Git hooks defined in the `package.json`.

### `lefthook`

`lefthook` is another popular Git hook manager known for its performance and support for parallel execution of hooks.

**Installation and Usage:**

1.  **Install `lefthook`:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g lefthook
    ```

2.  **Initialize `lefthook` in your project:**

    ```bash
    lefthook install
    ```

3.  **Configure `lefthook` in `lefthook.yml`:**

    Create a `lefthook.yml` file in your project root with the following structure:

    ```yaml
    pre-commit:
      commands:
        lint:
          run: npm run lint
        format:
          run: npm run format
    ```

    Again, ensure that `lint` and `format` scripts are defined in your `package.json`.

4.  **Commit the changes:** Commit the `lefthook.yml` file to your repository.

Similar to `husky`, when other developers clone the repository and run `npm install`, `lefthook` will install the Git hooks defined in `lefthook.yml`.

**Choosing Between `husky` and `lefthook`:**

Both `husky` and `lefthook` are excellent tools. `husky` is generally easier to set up, while `lefthook` offers better performance and more advanced features like parallel execution. Choose the tool that best suits your project's needs and complexity.

## Best Practices for Using Git Hooks

*   **Keep hooks short and focused:**  Hooks should perform specific, well-defined tasks. Avoid overly complex or lengthy scripts that can slow down the development workflow.
*   **Use a scripting language you're comfortable with:**  Choose a scripting language that you and your team are familiar with. Bash is commonly used, but Python, Node.js, or other languages can also be used.
*   **Handle errors gracefully:**  Implement proper error handling in your hooks to prevent them from crashing or causing unexpected behavior. Log errors and provide informative messages to the user.
*   **Use environment variables for sensitive data:**  Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in your hooks. Use environment variables instead.
*   **Test your hooks thoroughly:**  Test your hooks to ensure they work as expected and don't introduce any new issues.
*   **Document your hooks:**  Document your hooks to explain their purpose and how they work. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain them.
*   **Consider performance:**  Be mindful of the performance impact of your hooks.  Avoid running resource-intensive tasks in hooks that are triggered frequently (e.g., `pre-commit`).
*   **Use a Git hook manager:** Use a tool like `husky` or `lefthook` to manage and share Git hooks across your team. This ensures that everyone is using the same hooks and that they are automatically installed.
*   **Avoid breaking existing workflows:**  Carefully consider the impact of your hooks on existing workflows.  Avoid introducing changes that could disrupt the development process or cause frustration for developers.
*   **Provide clear and informative messages:**  When a hook fails, provide clear and informative messages to the user to explain what went wrong and how to fix it.

## Conclusion

Git hooks are a powerful tool for automating your CI/CD pipeline and improving the overall quality of your code. By using Git hooks, you can enforce coding standards, run tests automatically, and trigger deployments with ease.  Leveraging tools like `husky` and `lefthook` streamlines the sharing and management of these hooks across your development team.  By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively integrate Git hooks into your workflow and reap the benefits of a more automated and efficient development process.
