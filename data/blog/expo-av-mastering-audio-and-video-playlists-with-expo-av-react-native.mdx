# Expo AV: Mastering Audio and Video Playlists with Expo-AV (React Native)

Expo AV provides a powerful and easy-to-use API for playing audio and video in your React Native applications. This blog post dives deep into creating and managing playlists using `expo-av`, covering everything from basic setup to advanced features. If you want to build apps with great audio and video functionalities, especially with dynamic playlists, you are at the right place!

## What is Expo-AV?

Expo AV (formerly known as `expo-av`) is a library within the Expo SDK that allows you to play and record audio and video in your React Native apps. It provides a simple and consistent API across both iOS and Android, abstracting away the complexities of native media players. It supports:

- Playing audio and video from local files, remote URLs, or bundled assets.
- Controlling playback (play, pause, stop, seek, etc.).
- Handling playback status updates (duration, position, isPlaying, etc.).
- Creating and managing playlists.
- Advanced features like video resizing modes, audio ducking, and more.

## Why Use Expo-AV for Playlists?

Managing playlists manually in React Native can be cumbersome. Expo-AV simplifies the process by providing:

- **Abstraction:** It handles the underlying native media player complexities for you.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Code once, run on both iOS and Android.
- **Simplified API:** A clean and intuitive API for playlist management.
- **Status Updates:** Real-time information about the playlist's current state (e.g., current item, playback status).
- **Ease of Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Expo APIs.

## Getting Started: Installation

Before diving into playlists, you need to install `expo-av`. Open your React Native project's terminal and run:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-av
```

This command installs the `expo-av` package and its necessary dependencies.

**Important Note:** After installing, it's crucial to rebuild your native app by running `npx expo prebuild` (if it wasn't prebuilt already) and then rebuilding with EAS or your preferred method. This ensures the native dependencies are properly linked.

## Basic Playlist Implementation

Let's create a simple playlist with two audio tracks. First, import the necessary components from `expo-av`:

```plaintext
import { Audio } from 'expo-av'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button, Text } from 'react-native'
```

Next, define your playlist items. Each item should have a `uri` property (the audio/video source) and optionally other properties like `title`.

```plaintext
const playlist = [
  {
    uri: 'https://example.com/audio1.mp3', // Replace with your audio URL
    title: 'Track 1',
  },
  {
    uri: 'https://example.com/audio2.mp3', // Replace with your audio URL
    title: 'Track 2',
  },
]
```

Now, let's build the component to handle the playlist.

```plaintext
const PlaylistPlayer = () => {
  const [sound, setSound] = useState(null)
  const [currentTrackIndex, setCurrentTrackIndex] = useState(0)
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    loadAudio()

    return () => {
      if (sound) {
        sound.unloadAsync()
      }
    }
  }, [currentTrackIndex])

  const loadAudio = async () => {
    if (sound) {
      await sound.unloadAsync()
    }

    try {
      const { sound: newSound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(
        { uri: playlist[currentTrackIndex].uri },
        {
          shouldPlay: isPlaying,
        },
        (status) => {
          if (status.didJustFinish && !status.isLooping) {
            playNextTrack()
          }
        }
      )
      setSound(newSound)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load sound', error)
    }
  }

  const playPause = async () => {
    if (sound) {
      if (isPlaying) {
        await sound.pauseAsync()
      } else {
        await sound.playAsync()
      }
      setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)
    }
  }

  const playNextTrack = () => {
    const nextIndex = (currentTrackIndex + 1) % playlist.length
    setCurrentTrackIndex(nextIndex)
    setIsPlaying(true) // Ensure the next track starts playing
  }

  const playPreviousTrack = () => {
    const previousIndex = (currentTrackIndex - 1 + playlist.length) % playlist.length
    setCurrentTrackIndex(previousIndex)
    setIsPlaying(true) // Ensure the previous track starts playing
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Now Playing: {playlist[currentTrackIndex].title}</Text>
      <Button title={isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'} onPress={playPause} />
      <Button title="Next" onPress={playNextTrack} />
      <Button title="Previous" onPress={playPreviousTrack} />
    </View>
  )
}

export default PlaylistPlayer
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **State Variables:**

    - `sound`: Stores the `Audio.Sound` object.
    - `currentTrackIndex`: Keeps track of the currently playing track's index in the `playlist` array.
    - `isPlaying`: Indicates whether the audio is currently playing.

2.  **`useEffect` Hook:**

    - This hook runs whenever `currentTrackIndex` changes. This ensures that the `loadAudio` function is called whenever the playlist moves to a new track.
    - The cleanup function (`return () => ...`) unloads the sound when the component unmounts or when `currentTrackIndex` changes. This is crucial to prevent memory leaks.

3.  **`loadAudio` Function:**

    - This function loads the audio from the current track's `uri` using `Audio.Sound.createAsync`.
    - Before loading a new track, it checks if a sound is already loaded and unloads it using `sound.unloadAsync()`. This prevents multiple audio instances from playing simultaneously.
    - `Audio.Sound.createAsync` takes three arguments:
      - An object containing the `uri` of the audio file.
      - An object containing initial playback options. Here, we set `shouldPlay` based on the `isPlaying` state.
      - A callback function that receives playback status updates. This is where we handle the `didJustFinish` event to automatically play the next track when the current track finishes.
    - Error handling is included using a `try...catch` block.

4.  **`playPause` Function:**

    - This function toggles the playback state (play/pause).
    - It calls `sound.playAsync()` or `sound.pauseAsync()` based on the `isPlaying` state.
    - It updates the `isPlaying` state.

5.  **`playNextTrack` Function:**

    - Calculates the index of the next track, handling the case where the current track is the last track in the playlist (looping back to the beginning).
    - Updates the `currentTrackIndex` state, which triggers the `useEffect` hook and loads the new track.
    - Sets the `isPlaying` state to true to ensure the next track starts playing automatically.

6.  **`playPreviousTrack` Function:**

    - Calculates the index of the previous track, handling the case where the current track is the first track in the playlist (looping back to the end).
    - Updates the `currentTrackIndex` state, which triggers the `useEffect` hook and loads the new track.
    - Sets the `isPlaying` state to true to ensure the previous track starts playing automatically.

7.  **Return Statement:**
    - Renders a simple UI with:
      - A `Text` component displaying the title of the currently playing track.
      - A "Play/Pause" button that calls the `playPause` function.
      - A "Next" button that calls the `playNextTrack` function.
      - A "Previous" button that calls the `playPreviousTrack` function.

## Advanced Features and Considerations

- **Video Playlists:** Expo-AV supports both audio and video. You can easily create video playlists by simply changing the `uri` to point to video files (e.g., `.mp4`).
- **Local Files:** To play audio or video files stored locally in your app's assets, use the `require()` function to load the asset. For example:

  ```plaintext
  const playlist = [
    {
      uri: require('./assets/audio/track1.mp3'),
      title: 'Local Track 1',
    },
    // ...
  ]
  ```

- **Playback Status Updates:** The callback function passed to `Audio.Sound.createAsync` receives frequent playback status updates. You can use this information to:

  - Display the current playback position.
  - Show loading progress.
  - Implement custom playback controls.
  - Handle errors.

  Example:

  ```plaintext
  Audio.Sound.createAsync(
    { uri: playlist[currentTrackIndex].uri },
    { shouldPlay: isPlaying },
    (status) => {
      if (status.isLoaded) {
        console.log('Duration:', status.durationMillis)
        console.log('Position:', status.positionMillis)
      }
      if (status.didJustFinish && !status.isLooping) {
        playNextTrack()
      }
      if (status.error) {
        console.error('Playback error:', status.error)
      }
    }
  )
  ```

- **Looping:** To loop a single track or the entire playlist, you can set the `isLooping` property in the playback options or in the playback status.

  ```plaintext
  // Loop a single track
  await sound.setIsLoopingAsync(true)

  // Loop the entire playlist (requires custom logic)
  // In the playNextTrack function, reset to index 0 after the last track
  ```

- **Custom Controls:** Expo-AV provides the building blocks for creating fully customized playback controls. You can use React Native components to build play/pause buttons, seek bars, volume sliders, and more.

- **Background Audio:** To allow audio playback to continue when your app is in the background, you need to configure background audio capabilities. Refer to the Expo documentation for details on how to configure this correctly for both iOS and Android. (Search "Expo AV background audio" for the most up-to-date instructions).

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where audio files cannot be loaded or played. Display user-friendly error messages and provide options for retrying or skipping the problematic track.

- **Optimization:** Optimize your audio and video files for mobile playback. Use appropriate compression and resolutions to minimize file sizes and ensure smooth playback on a variety of devices.

## Troubleshooting

- **Audio Not Playing:**

  - Double-check the `uri` of your audio file to ensure it is correct and accessible.
  - Verify that your device has an active internet connection if you are streaming audio from a remote URL.
  - Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access audio files (especially if you are using local files). Expo automatically handles most permissions, but it's worth checking.
  - Make sure the audio file format is supported by the device. MP3 is a widely supported format.
  - Check the console for error messages related to audio playback.

- **Audio Stops Playing in Background:**
  - Ensure that you have correctly configured background audio capabilities in your app's configuration file (e.g., `app.json`).
  - Verify that the device's battery optimization settings are not interfering with background audio playback.
- **Unexpected Behavior:**
  - Make sure you are using the latest version of `expo-av` and related Expo packages.
  - Check the Expo documentation and community forums for known issues and solutions.
  - Use a debugger to step through your code and identify the root cause of the problem.
