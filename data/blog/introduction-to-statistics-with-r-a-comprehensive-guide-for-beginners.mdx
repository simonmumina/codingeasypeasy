4.  **Open RStudio:** Launch RStudio, and you're ready to start writing and executing R code.

## Fundamental Statistical Concepts

Let's cover some key statistical concepts before we start writing R code.

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Common descriptive statistics include:

- **Mean:** The average value of a dataset.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating the mean of a vector
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
  mean_value <- mean(data)
  print(mean_value)  # Output: 20
  ```

- **Median:** The middle value of a dataset when it's ordered.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating the median of a vector
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
  median_value <- median(data)
  print(median_value)  # Output: 20
  ```

- **Mode:** The most frequent value in a dataset. (R doesn't have a built-in mode function; you'll need to create one.)

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating the mode of a vector
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 15, 30, 15)

  getmode <- function(v) {
    uniqv <- unique(v)
    uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
  }

  mode_value <- getmode(data)
  print(mode_value) # Output: 15
  ```

- **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the spread or dispersion of data around the mean.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating the standard deviation of a vector
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
  sd_value <- sd(data)
  print(sd_value)  # Output: 7.905694
  ```

- **Variance:** The square of the standard deviation, another measure of dispersion.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating the variance of a vector
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
  var_value <- var(data)
  print(var_value) # Output: 62.5
  ```

- **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating the range of a vector
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
  range_value <- max(data) - min(data)
  print(range_value) # Output: 20
  ```

- **Percentiles:** Values that divide a dataset into 100 equal parts (e.g., the 25th percentile, the 75th percentile).

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating the 25th and 75th percentiles
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)
  percentiles <- quantile(data, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
  print(percentiles)
  # Output:
  #  25%  75%
  # 12.5 27.5
  ```

### 2. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics are used to make inferences or predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. Key concepts include:

- **Population vs. Sample:** A population is the entire group of interest, while a sample is a subset of the population.

- **Hypothesis Testing:** A formal procedure for testing a claim or hypothesis about a population. Involves setting up a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1) and determining whether there's enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: T-test (comparing the means of two groups)
  group1 <- c(10, 12, 14, 16, 18)
  group2 <- c(8, 11, 13, 15, 17)

  # Perform a t-test
  t_test_result <- t.test(group1, group2)
  print(t_test_result)

  # Interpretation: The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data if the null
  # hypothesis (no difference between the means) is true. A small p-value (e.g., less than 0.05)
  # suggests evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
  ```

- **Confidence Intervals:** A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Calculating a confidence interval for the mean
  data <- c(10, 15, 20, 25, 30)

  # Perform a t-test to get a confidence interval
  t_test_result <- t.test(data)
  print(t_test_result$conf.int) # This will print the confidence interval
  ```

- **Regression Analysis:** A statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

  ```plaintext
  # Example: Linear Regression
  # Create some sample data
  x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Independent variable
  y <- c(2, 4, 5, 4, 5)  # Dependent variable

  # Fit a linear regression model
  model <- lm(y ~ x)  # y is modeled as a function of x

  # Print the model summary
  summary(model)

  # Interpretation:  The summary provides information about the coefficients (intercept and slope),
  # their significance (p-values), and the overall goodness of fit of the model (R-squared).
  ```

- **Probability Distributions:** Mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable (e.g., normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution).

### 3. Types of Data

Understanding different data types is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical methods.

- **Numerical Data:** Represents quantities or measurements.

  - **Continuous Data:** Can take on any value within a range (e.g., height, temperature).
  - **Discrete Data:** Can only take on specific values, often integers (e.g., number of children, number of cars).

- **Categorical Data:** Represents categories or labels.

  - **Nominal Data:** Categories have no inherent order (e.g., colors, types of fruit).
  - **Ordinal Data:** Categories have a meaningful order (e.g., education level, customer satisfaction ratings).

## Working with Data in R

### 1. Creating and Importing Data

- **Creating Vectors:** A vector is a one-dimensional array of data.

  ```plaintext
  # Creating a numeric vector
  numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

  # Creating a character vector
  character_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")

  # Creating a logical vector
  logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
  ```

- **Creating Data Frames:** A data frame is a tabular data structure with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet.

  ```plaintext
  # Creating a data frame
  name <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
  age <- c(25, 30, 28)
  city <- c("New York", "London", "Paris")

  data_frame <- data.frame(name, age, city)
  print(data_frame)
  ```

- **Importing Data from Files:** R can import data from various file formats, such as CSV (Comma Separated Values), Excel, and text files.

  ```plaintext
  # Importing data from a CSV file
  data <- read.csv("your_data_file.csv") # Replace "your_data_file.csv" with the actual file name.
  print(head(data)) #  Print the first few rows of the data frame.  Use head() to avoid printing the entire dataset.
  ```

### 2. Data Manipulation

R provides powerful functions for manipulating data frames.

- **Selecting Columns:**

  ```plaintext
  # Selecting a single column
  ages <- data$age  # Assuming "data" is your data frame and "age" is the column name.
  print(ages)

  # Selecting multiple columns
  subset_data <- data[, c("name", "city")] # Selects the "name" and "city" columns.
  print(subset_data)
  ```

- **Filtering Rows:**

  ```plaintext
  # Filtering rows based on a condition
  older_than_28 <- data[data$age > 28, ] # Selects rows where the age is greater than 28.
  print(older_than_28)
  ```

- **Adding New Columns:**

  ```plaintext
  # Adding a new column
  data$age_in_months <- data$age * 12 #  Calculates age in months and adds a new column.
  print(data)
  ```

- **Sorting Data:**

  ```plaintext
  # Sorting data by age
  sorted_data <- data[order(data$age), ] # Sorts the data frame in ascending order by age.
  print(sorted_data)
  ```

### 3. Data Visualization

R offers excellent tools for creating graphs and charts to visualize data. The `ggplot2` package is particularly powerful and flexible.

```plaintext
# Install ggplot2 (if you haven't already)
# install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Example: Creating a scatter plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = age, y = runif(nrow(data), min=0, max=100))) +  # runif creates random y values
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Random Number",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Random Number")

# Example: Creating a histogram
ggplot(data, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + #Adjust binwidth for better visuals
  labs(title = "Histogram of Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency")

# Example: Creating a box plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = city, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Age by City",
       x = "City",
       y = "Age")
```
