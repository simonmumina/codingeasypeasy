# Mocking External API Calls in Pytest with FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide

Testing is a crucial part of building robust and reliable applications. When working with FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, you'll often need to interact with external APIs.  Testing these interactions can be challenging because you don't want your tests to rely on the availability or state of external services.  This is where mocking comes in.

This guide will walk you through various techniques for mocking external API calls in your FastAPI application using Pytest. We'll cover simple monkeypatching, utilizing `requests-mock`, and leveraging dependency injection for cleaner, more maintainable tests.

## Why Mock External API Calls?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand why mocking is essential:

*   **Isolation:** Mocking isolates your application code from external dependencies, ensuring that your tests only evaluate the logic within your control.
*   **Stability:** External APIs can be unreliable, causing tests to fail due to network issues or API downtime. Mocking removes this dependency, making your tests more stable.
*   **Reproducibility:** External API responses can change over time. Mocking guarantees that your tests will always receive the same predictable responses.
*   **Speed:** Making real API calls can be slow, especially if the external service is located far away or has slow response times. Mocking significantly speeds up your test suite.
*   **Cost:** Some APIs charge for usage. Mocking prevents incurring unnecessary costs during testing.
*   **Edge Cases:** Easily simulate error scenarios and edge cases that would be difficult or impossible to trigger with the real API.

## Setting Up the Environment

First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio fastapi uvicorn requests aiohttp requests-mock
```

*   **pytest:** The popular Python testing framework.
*   **pytest-asyncio:**  For testing asynchronous code in FastAPI.
*   **fastapi:** The web framework.
*   **uvicorn:** An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
*   **requests:** A popular HTTP library for making API requests (we'll use `aiohttp` as well, showcasing both)
*   **aiohttp:** An asynchronous HTTP client.
*   **requests-mock:** A library specifically designed for mocking `requests` library calls.

## Example FastAPI Application

Let's define a simple FastAPI application that makes an external API call:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import requests
import aiohttp
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

EXTERNAL_API_URL = "https://api.example.com/data"
EXTERNAL_API_URL_ASYNC = "https://api.example.com/async_data"


@app.get("/data")
async def get_data():
    try:
        response = requests.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return {"error": f"Failed to fetch data: {e}"}


@app.get("/async_data")
async def get_async_data():
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL_ASYNC) as response:
                response.raise_for_status()
                return await response.json()
    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
        return {"error": f"Failed to fetch data asynchronously: {e}"}
```

This application has two endpoints:

*   `/data`: Makes a synchronous request to `https://api.example.com/data` using the `requests` library.
*   `/async_data`: Makes an asynchronous request to `https://api.example.com/async_data` using the `aiohttp` library.

## Mocking Techniques

Now, let's explore different techniques for mocking these external API calls in our Pytest tests.

### 1. Monkeypatching

Monkeypatching is a dynamic technique that allows you to replace attributes of objects, classes, or modules at runtime.  Pytest provides a convenient `monkeypatch` fixture for this purpose.

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app, EXTERNAL_API_URL, EXTERNAL_API_URL_ASYNC
import json
import asyncio


@pytest.fixture
def test_client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client


def test_get_data_monkeypatch(test_client, monkeypatch):
    """
    Tests the /data endpoint by monkeypatching requests.get to return a mock response.
    """
    mock_response_data = {"message": "Mocked data from API"}

    def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
        class MockResponse:
            def json(self):
                return mock_response_data

            def raise_for_status(self):
                pass  # Simulate successful response

        return MockResponse()

    monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", mock_get)  # Replace requests.get with our mock

    response = test_client.get("/data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == mock_response_data


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_async_data_monkeypatch(test_client, monkeypatch):
    """
    Tests the /async_data endpoint by monkeypatching aiohttp.ClientSession.get to return a mock response.
    """
    mock_response_data = {"message": "Mocked data from async API"}

    async def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
        class MockResponse:
            async def json(self):
                return mock_response_data

            async def raise_for_status(self):
                pass

        return MockResponse()

    monkeypatch.setattr("aiohttp.ClientSession.get", mock_get)

    response = test_client.get("/async_data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == mock_response_data

```

**Explanation:**

1.  We define a `test_client` fixture using `fastapi.testclient.TestClient` to easily make requests to our FastAPI application.

2.  In `test_get_data_monkeypatch`, we define a `mock_get` function that simulates the behavior of `requests.get`. It returns a `MockResponse` object with a `json()` method that returns our desired mock data.  We also include `raise_for_status` to prevent errors.

3.  We use `monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", mock_get)` to replace the `requests.get` function with our `mock_get` function *during the execution of this specific test*.

4.  Similarly, `test_get_async_data_monkeypatch` handles the asynchronous `aiohttp` call by mocking `aiohttp.ClientSession.get`.  Note the `async` keywords required for async mocking.

**Advantages:**

*   Simple and straightforward for basic mocking.
*   Built-in to Pytest, requiring no additional dependencies.

**Disadvantages:**

*   Can be difficult to manage in larger projects with many tests.
*   Relies on global state manipulation, which can lead to unexpected side effects if not used carefully.
*   Can become less readable with complex mocking scenarios.

### 2. Using `requests-mock`

The `requests-mock` library provides a more declarative and convenient way to mock `requests` library calls.

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app, EXTERNAL_API_URL
import requests_mock


@pytest.fixture
def test_client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client


def test_get_data_requests_mock(test_client):
    """
    Tests the /data endpoint using requests-mock.
    """
    mock_response_data = {"message": "Mocked data from requests-mock"}

    with requests_mock.Mocker() as m:
        m.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL, json=mock_response_data, status_code=200)

        response = test_client.get("/data")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == mock_response_data

```

**Explanation:**

1.  We use `requests_mock.Mocker()` as a context manager.  This creates a mock adapter that intercepts HTTP requests.

2.  `m.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL, json=mock_response_data, status_code=200)` configures the mock adapter to intercept GET requests to `EXTERNAL_API_URL` and return the specified JSON data and status code.

**Advantages:**

*   More readable and maintainable than monkeypatching.
*   Supports various matching criteria (URL, headers, body, etc.).
*   Can verify that a request was made a certain number of times.

**Disadvantages:**

*   Only works with the `requests` library. It does not support other HTTP clients like `aiohttp` directly.

### 3. Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a powerful technique that allows you to replace dependencies with mocks during testing.  This approach is particularly well-suited for FastAPI applications because FastAPI has built-in dependency injection support.

First, let's refactor our FastAPI application to use dependency injection:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
import requests
import aiohttp
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

EXTERNAL_API_URL = "https://api.example.com/data"
EXTERNAL_API_URL_ASYNC = "https://api.example.com/async_data"


# Define a function that makes the actual API call (synchronous)
def get_external_data_sync():
    try:
        response = requests.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return {"error": f"Failed to fetch data: {e}"}


# Define a function that makes the actual API call (asynchronous)
async def get_external_data_async():
    try:
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL_ASYNC) as response:
                response.raise_for_status()
                return await response.json()
    except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
        return {"error": f"Failed to fetch data asynchronously: {e}"}


@app.get("/data")
async def get_data(data: dict = Depends(get_external_data_sync)):
    return data


@app.get("/async_data")
async def get_async_data(data: dict = Depends(get_external_data_async)):
    return data


```

**Changes:**

1.  We've created two new functions, `get_external_data_sync` and `get_external_data_async`, which encapsulate the actual API calls.

2.  We use `Depends(get_external_data_sync)` and `Depends(get_external_data_async)` in the `/data` and `/async_data` endpoints, respectively.  This tells FastAPI to inject the result of these functions as dependencies.

Now, let's write the tests:

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app, get_external_data_sync, get_external_data_async
from fastapi import Depends


@pytest.fixture
def test_client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client


def test_get_data_dependency_injection(test_client):
    """
    Tests the /data endpoint by overriding the dependency with a mock function.
    """
    mock_response_data = {"message": "Mocked data from dependency injection"}

    def mock_get_external_data():
        return mock_response_data

    app.dependency_overrides[get_external_data_sync] = mock_get_external_data

    response = test_client.get("/data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == mock_response_data

    app.dependency_overrides = {} # Clear the override after the test


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_async_data_dependency_injection(test_client):
    """
    Tests the /async_data endpoint by overriding the async dependency with a mock function.
    """
    mock_response_data = {"message": "Mocked data from async dependency injection"}

    async def mock_get_external_data():
        return mock_response_data

    app.dependency_overrides[get_external_data_async] = mock_get_external_data

    response = test_client.get("/async_data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == mock_response_data

    app.dependency_overrides = {} # Clear the override after the test

```

**Explanation:**

1.  We define `mock_get_external_data` and `mock_get_external_data` functions that return our mock data.

2.  We use `app.dependency_overrides` to replace the original dependency (`get_external_data_sync` or `get_external_data_async`) with our mock function. This override is *only* active during the execution of this specific test.

3.  We clear the override `app.dependency_overrides = {}` after the test to avoid affecting other tests. This is extremely important.

**Advantages:**

*   Clean and maintainable.
*   Promotes loose coupling and testability.
*   Provides a clear and explicit way to mock dependencies.
*   FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system makes this approach easy to implement.

**Disadvantages:**

*   Requires refactoring your application to use dependency injection.
*   Slightly more complex than monkeypatching or `requests-mock`.

## Handling Error Scenarios

Mocking is particularly useful for simulating error scenarios.  Let's see how to handle errors with each technique.

### Monkeypatching:

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app, EXTERNAL_API_URL
import requests


@pytest.fixture
def test_client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client


def test_get_data_monkeypatch_error(test_client, monkeypatch):
    """
    Tests the /data endpoint when the external API returns an error.
    """

    def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):
        class MockResponse:
            def json(self):
                return {}  # Return empty dict in case of error handling

            def raise_for_status(self):
                raise requests.exceptions.HTTPError("Simulated API error")

        return MockResponse()

    monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", mock_get)

    response = test_client.get("/data")
    assert response.status_code == 200  #  Endpoint always returns 200 OK
    assert "error" in response.json()
```

### `requests-mock`:

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app, EXTERNAL_API_URL
import requests_mock


@pytest.fixture
def test_client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client


def test_get_data_requests_mock_error(test_client):
    """
    Tests the /data endpoint when the external API returns an error using requests-mock.
    """

    with requests_mock.Mocker() as m:
        m.get(EXTERNAL_API_URL, status_code=500)  # Simulate a 500 error

        response = test_client.get("/data")
        assert response.status_code == 200  # Endpoint always returns 200 OK
        assert "error" in response.json()
```

### Dependency Injection:

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app, get_external_data_sync
from fastapi import Depends


@pytest.fixture
def test_client():
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client


def test_get_data_dependency_injection_error(test_client):
    """
    Tests the /data endpoint when the external API call fails, using dependency injection.
    """

    def mock_get_external_data():
        return {"error": "Simulated API error during dependency injection"}

    app.dependency_overrides[get_external_data_sync] = mock_get_external_data

    response = test_client.get("/data")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "error" in response.json()

    app.dependency_overrides = {}
```

In all of these error scenario examples, we simulate a failure in the external API call and verify that our application handles the error gracefully.  The `test_get_data_dependency_injection_error` and `test_get_data_dependency_injection`  are crucial examples because they demonstrate how to effectively use dependency injection for unit testing your FastAPI application.  Remember to clean up `app.dependency_overrides = {}` after each test.

## Choosing the Right Technique

The best mocking technique depends on your specific needs and project complexity:

*   **Monkeypatching:** Use for simple cases where you need a quick and easy way to mock a function.  However, avoid using it in large projects.
*   **`requests-mock`:** Ideal for mocking `requests` library calls in a more declarative and maintainable way.  Not suitable for async clients.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The most robust and flexible approach, especially for larger FastAPI applications.  Requires more initial setup but leads to cleaner and more testable code.

## Best Practices for Mocking

*   **Keep your mocks simple:** Avoid creating overly complex mocks that mirror the behavior of the real API.
*   **Use descriptive names:** Name your mock functions and variables clearly to indicate what they are mocking.
*   **Avoid global state:** When using monkeypatching or other techniques that modify global state, make sure to clean up after your tests to avoid affecting other tests.
*   **Focus on behavior, not implementation:**  Mock the *behavior* of the external API, not its specific implementation details. This makes your tests more resilient to changes in the external API.
*   **Test error scenarios:**  Don't just test the happy path.  Make sure to test how your application handles errors and unexpected responses from the external API.

## Conclusion

Mocking external API calls is an essential skill for writing robust and reliable tests for your FastAPI applications. By using techniques like monkeypatching, `requests-mock`, and dependency injection, you can isolate your code, improve test stability, and speed up your test suite.  Choose the technique that best suits your needs and follow best practices to create effective and maintainable tests.  Remember the key advantages and disadvantages of each approach to make an informed decision. Good testing is crucial for deploying robust APIs!
