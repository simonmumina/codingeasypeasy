# Connect Laravel to Neon: A Step-by-Step Guide with Code Examples

Neon is a fully managed, serverless Postgres database designed for modern applications. It offers branching, serverless compute, and a generous free tier, making it an excellent choice for Laravel projects. This guide will walk you through connecting your Laravel application to a Neon Postgres database, covering everything from setting up your Neon project to configuring your Laravel application and performing basic database operations.

## Why Use Neon with Laravel?

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly outline the benefits of using Neon with your Laravel application:

- **Serverless:** Neon automatically scales compute resources based on demand, eliminating the need for manual server provisioning and management.
- **Branching:** Neon's branching feature allows you to create isolated database environments for testing, development, and staging, enabling safer and faster deployments.
- **Cost-Effective:** Neon offers a generous free tier suitable for smaller projects, and its pay-as-you-go pricing ensures you only pay for the resources you use.
- **Postgres Compatibility:** Neon is fully compatible with Postgres, allowing you to leverage existing Postgres knowledge and tools.
- **Easy Integration:** Connecting to Neon from Laravel is straightforward using standard database configuration methods.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **A Neon Account:** Sign up for a free account at [https://neon.tech/](https://neon.tech/).
- **PHP and Composer:** PHP version 8.0 or higher and Composer are required for Laravel development.
- **Laravel Project:** A running Laravel project. If you don't have one, create a new project using:

  ```plaintext
  composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel your-project-name
  cd your-project-name
  ```

- **Postgres Extensions for PHP:** Ensure the `pdo_pgsql` extension is enabled in your PHP configuration. This is usually done in `php.ini`.

## Step 1: Create a Neon Project and Database

1.  **Log in to your Neon account:** Go to the Neon dashboard and log in with your credentials.
2.  **Create a new project:** Click the "New Project" button and follow the prompts to create a new Neon project. Choose the region closest to your application servers for optimal latency.
3.  **Create a new database:** Neon automatically creates a default database. If you need additional databases, you can create them from the Neon dashboard. Take note of the **connection string** or connection parameters such as host, database name, username, and password. You'll need these to configure your Laravel application.

## Step 2: Configure Your Laravel Application

1.  **Install the Postgres driver:** Laravel uses the `pgsql` driver for Postgres connections. If it's not already installed, install it with composer:

    ```plaintext
    composer require doctrine/dbal
    ```

    _Note:_ Doctrine DBAL is often used for database schema migrations and other database management tasks in Laravel. While the core PDO Postgres extension handles the actual connection and queries, Doctrine DBAL can provide enhanced functionality.

2.  **Update your `.env` file:** Open your Laravel project's `.env` file and update the database connection details to match your Neon database connection string. You can directly use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable if your connection string is in the correct format, or you can configure individual parameters.

    **Option 1: Using DATABASE_URL**

    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?sslmode=require"
    ```

    Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<host>`, `<port>`, and `<database>` with the actual values from your Neon connection string. _Important:_ `sslmode=require` enforces SSL encryption for the connection, which is recommended for security. Neon generally requires SSL.

    **Option 2: Configuring Individual Parameters**

    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
    DB_HOST=<host>
    DB_PORT=<port>
    DB_DATABASE=<database>
    DB_USERNAME=<username>
    DB_PASSWORD=<password>
    DB_ENCODING=utf8
    DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
    DB_COLLATION=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
    DB_PREFIX=
    DB_PREFIX_INDEXES=true
    DB_SCHEMA=public
    DB_SSL_MODE=require
    ```

    Again, replace the placeholders with your Neon connection parameters. The `DB_SSL_MODE=require` line is crucial for secure communication. Neon mandates SSL, so omitting this configuration will likely lead to connection errors.

3.  **Configure `config/database.php` (if needed):** While the `.env` file usually suffices, you can further customize the database connection in the `config/database.php` file. Locate the `pgsql` connection configuration and ensure it reflects the settings from your `.env` file:

    ```php
    'pgsql' => [
        'driver' => 'pgsql',
        'url' => env('DATABASE_URL'),
        'host' => env('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
        'port' => env('DB_PORT', '5432'),
        'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', 'forge'),
        'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'forge'),
        'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
        'charset' => 'utf8',
        'prefix' => '',
        'prefix_indexes' => true,
        'schema' => 'public',
        'sslmode' => 'require', // Enforce SSL
    ],
    ```

    Note the `sslmode` option.

## Step 3: Test the Connection

Let's test the connection to your Neon database. You can do this using Laravel Tinker, the interactive REPL environment.

1.  **Open Tinker:** Run the following command in your Laravel project directory:

    ```plaintext
    php artisan tinker
    ```

2.  **Run a simple query:** Execute a simple SQL query to verify the connection:

    ```php
    >>> DB::select('SELECT version()');
    ```

    If the connection is successful, you should see the Postgres version information returned. If you encounter an error, double-check your `.env` file and `config/database.php` configurations, paying close attention to the host, username, password, database name, and the `sslmode` setting. Common errors include incorrect credentials or missing SSL configuration.

## Step 4: Performing Basic Database Operations with Eloquent

Now that you have established a connection, you can perform database operations using Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

1.  **Create a Model (if you don't have one already):** Let's create a simple `User` model. Run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    php artisan make:model User -m
    ```

    This will create a `User` model and a corresponding migration file.

2.  **Define the Migration:** Open the `database/migrations/<timestamp>_create_users_table.php` file and define the table schema:

    ```php
    <?php

    use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
    use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

    return new class extends Migration
    {
        /**
         * Run the migrations.
         */
        public function up(): void
        {
            Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
                $table->id();
                $table->string('name');
                $table->string('email')->unique();
                $table->timestamp('email_verified_at')->nullable();
                $table->string('password');
                $table->rememberToken();
                $table->timestamps();
            });
        }

        /**
         * Reverse the migrations.
         */
        public function down(): void
        {
            Schema::dropIfExists('users');
        }
    };
    ```

3.  **Run the Migrations:** Execute the migrations to create the `users` table in your Neon database:

    ```plaintext
    php artisan migrate
    ```

4.  **Use the Model:** Now you can use the `User` model to interact with the `users` table. For example, to create a new user:

    ```php
    use App\Models\User;

    $user = new User();
    $user->name = 'John Doe';
    $user->email = 'john.doe@example.com';
    $user->password = bcrypt('secret');
    $user->save();

    echo "User created with ID: " . $user->id;
    ```

    Or to retrieve all users:

    ```php
    use App\Models\User;

    $users = User::all();

    foreach ($users as $user) {
        echo $user->name . "<br>";
    }
    ```

## Step 5: Addressing Potential Issues

- **SSL Errors:** If you encounter SSL-related errors, ensure that `DB_SSL_MODE=require` is set in your `.env` file and that your Postgres client (in this case, the PHP `pdo_pgsql` extension) is configured to require SSL.
- **Connection Timeouts:** Long-running queries or high database load can lead to connection timeouts. Consider increasing the `DB_TIMEOUT` setting in your `config/database.php` file or optimizing your queries. Neon's serverless nature should handle scaling but poorly optimized queries can still be an issue.
- **Migration Issues:** If you run into problems during migrations, double-check your migration files for syntax errors and ensure that your database connection is correctly configured. Also, remember that Neon's branching can lead to a situation where your migrations are run on the wrong branch.
- **Database Seeding:** If you're using database seeders, ensure they're correctly configured to connect to your Neon database. The seeder should use the same database connection settings as your application.

## Step 6: Leveraging Neon's Branching Feature

One of the key benefits of using Neon is its branching capability. This allows you to create separate, isolated database environments for development, testing, and staging.

1.  **Create a Branch:** In the Neon dashboard, create a new branch from your main database branch. This will create a complete copy of your database schema and data in a separate environment.
2.  **Configure your Laravel application:** To use the new branch, you need to update your Laravel application's `.env` file with the connection details for the new branch. You can create separate `.env` files for different environments (e.g., `.env.staging`, `.env.testing`) or use environment variables to dynamically configure the database connection based on the current environment.
3.  **Run Migrations (if necessary):** If you have any new migrations or database changes, run them on the new branch.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test your application thoroughly in the new environment to ensure that it's working correctly.

## Conclusion

Connecting your Laravel application to a Neon Postgres database is a straightforward process that can unlock significant benefits in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and development workflow. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly integrate your Laravel application with Neon and leverage its powerful features. Remember to pay close attention to connection configuration, especially SSL settings, and to utilize Neon's branching capabilities for enhanced development and deployment practices. Happy coding!
