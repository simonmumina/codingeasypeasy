# Implementing GraphQL Subscriptions in Express: A Comprehensive Guide

GraphQL subscriptions enable real-time data updates from your server to your clients, allowing you to build dynamic and interactive applications. This guide will walk you through implementing GraphQL subscriptions in an Express application using Apollo Server and WebSockets. We'll cover everything from setting up your server to testing your subscriptions.

## What are GraphQL Subscriptions?

GraphQL subscriptions are a GraphQL feature that allows clients to receive real-time updates from the server when specific events occur. Unlike queries and mutations, which are based on a request-response model, subscriptions maintain a persistent connection between the client and the server. This connection allows the server to push updates to the client whenever the data associated with the subscription changes.

**Key Benefits of GraphQL Subscriptions:**

*   **Real-Time Updates:**  Provide immediate data updates to clients without polling.
*   **Efficient Data Transfer:**  Only send the necessary data updates, minimizing bandwidth usage.
*   **Scalability:**  Designed to handle a large number of concurrent subscribers.
*   **Declarative Approach:**  Clients specify the exact data they want to subscribe to.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:**  Version 16 or higher
*   **npm or yarn:**  Package manager

## Setting up the Project

Let's start by creating a new Node.js project and installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash
mkdir graphql-subscriptions-express
cd graphql-subscriptions-express
npm init -y
npm install express graphql @apollo/server ws graphql-ws
npm install -D nodemon ts-node typescript @types/node @types/express
```

*   `express`: For creating our web server.
*   `graphql`: The core GraphQL library.
*   `@apollo/server`: Apollo Server for handling GraphQL requests and subscriptions.
*   `ws`:  A WebSocket library for handling real-time connections.
*   `graphql-ws`:  WebSocket protocol implementation for GraphQL Subscriptions.
*   `nodemon`: (Dev Dependency) For automatically restarting the server on code changes.
*   `ts-node`: (Dev Dependency) For running TypeScript files directly.
*   `typescript`: (Dev Dependency)  For type safety and modern JavaScript features.
*   `@types/node`: (Dev Dependency)  Type definitions for Node.js.
*   `@types/express`: (Dev Dependency)  Type definitions for Express.js.

Next, configure TypeScript:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

This will create a `tsconfig.json` file.  You may want to adjust the settings in `tsconfig.json` to suit your project. A basic configuration that works well is as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Add a `start` and `dev` script to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "graphql-subscriptions-express",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "@apollo/server": "^4.9.7",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "graphql": "^16.8.1",
    "graphql-ws": "^5.14.2",
    "ws": "^8.16.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^4.17.24",
    "@types/node": "^20.11.20",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.0",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.2",
    "typescript": "^5.4.2"
  }
}
```

Create a `src` directory and add an `index.ts` file.

```bash
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

## Implementing the GraphQL Server

Now, let's implement the GraphQL server with subscriptions.  Open `src/index.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer } from '@apollo/server/plugin/drainHttpServer';
import { expressMiddleware } from '@apollo/server/express4';
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import { useServer } from 'graphql-ws/lib/use/ws';
import { PubSub } from 'graphql-subscriptions';
import cors from 'cors';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';

// Define the schema
const typeDefs = `#graphql
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }

  type Subscription {
    numberIncreased: Int
  }
`;

// Create a PubSub instance
const pubsub = new PubSub();

// Define the resolvers
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
  Subscription: {
    numberIncreased: {
      subscribe: () => pubsub.asyncIterator(['NUMBER_INCREASED']),
    },
  },
};

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });

// Create an Express app
const app = express();

// HTTP server
const httpServer = createServer(app);

// WebSocket server
const wsServer = new WebSocketServer({
  server: httpServer,
  path: '/graphql',
});

// Integrate the WebSocket server with Apollo Server
const serverCleanup = useServer({ schema }, wsServer);

// Apollo Server instance
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  plugins: [
    // Proper shutdown for the HTTP server.
    ApolloServerPluginDrainHttpServer({ httpServer }),

    // Proper shutdown for the WebSocket server.
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async drainServer() {
            await serverCleanup.dispose();
          },
        };
      },
    },
  ],
});

// Start the server
async function startServer() {
  await server.start();

  app.use(
    '/graphql',
    cors<cors.CorsRequest>(),
    bodyParser.json(),
    expressMiddleware(server),
  );

  const PORT = 4000;
  httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}/graphql`);
  });

  // Simulate publishing data
  let currentNumber = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    currentNumber++;
    pubsub.publish('NUMBER_INCREASED', { numberIncreased: currentNumber });
  }, 1000);
}

startServer();
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** We import Express, Apollo Server, WebSocketServer, graphql-ws, and other required modules.
2.  **Define the GraphQL schema:** We define a simple schema with a `hello` query and a `numberIncreased` subscription.
3.  **Create a PubSub instance:**  `PubSub` from `graphql-subscriptions` is used for managing the publication and subscription of events. This is a simple in-memory implementation.  For production, consider using a more robust message queue like Redis or RabbitMQ.
4.  **Define the resolvers:** We define resolvers for the `hello` query and the `numberIncreased` subscription. The subscription resolver uses `pubsub.asyncIterator` to listen for events published to the `NUMBER_INCREASED` topic.
5.  **Create an Express app:** We create an Express app and an HTTP server.
6.  **Create a WebSocket server:** We create a WebSocket server that listens for connections on the `/graphql` path.
7.  **Integrate the WebSocket server with Apollo Server:** We use `useServer` from `graphql-ws` to integrate the WebSocket server with Apollo Server. This handles the GraphQL over WebSocket protocol.
8.  **Create an Apollo Server instance:** We create an Apollo Server instance with the schema and plugins for proper HTTP and WebSocket server shutdown.
9.  **Start the server:** We start the Apollo Server and the HTTP server.  We also simulate publishing data to the `NUMBER_INCREASED` topic every second using `pubsub.publish`.

## Testing the Subscription

To test the subscription, you can use a GraphQL client like Apollo Client or GraphiQL.  You can also use a tool like [Altair GraphQL Client](https://altairgraphql.dev/) to easily test subscriptions.  Here's an example subscription query:

```graphql
subscription {
  numberIncreased
}
```

Open Altair GraphQL Client or any GraphQL client and connect to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.  Paste the subscription query into the client and run it.  You should see the `numberIncreased` field updating every second with the current number.

## Conclusion

This guide has shown you how to implement GraphQL subscriptions in an Express application using Apollo Server and WebSockets. By following these steps, you can build real-time applications that provide immediate data updates to your clients. Remember to choose an appropriate message queue for production environments and handle potential errors gracefully.  Experiment with more complex schemas and data sources to explore the full potential of GraphQL subscriptions.
