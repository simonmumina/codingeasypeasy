# Gatsby & Cloudflare Workers: Unleashing Edge Computing for Lightning-Fast Websites

In today's digital landscape, website speed and responsiveness are paramount. Users expect near-instantaneous loading times, and search engines prioritize fast-loading sites. While Gatsby, a powerful static site generator, offers excellent performance out of the box, we can take it to the next level by leveraging **edge computing** with **Cloudflare Workers**.

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Gatsby with Cloudflare Workers, enabling you to execute code on Cloudflare's global network. This allows you to perform tasks such as:

- **Dynamic Content Delivery:** Serve personalized content based on user location or other factors.
- **A/B Testing:** Run A/B tests without impacting your Gatsby build process.
- **Feature Flags:** Implement feature flags to control the rollout of new features.
- **Image Optimization:** Optimize images on the fly for different devices.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication at the edge, reducing load on your origin server.
- **Caching Strategies:** Implement advanced caching strategies based on request attributes.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following:

- **A Gatsby Project:** You'll need an existing Gatsby project. If you don't have one, create a new one using `gatsby new`.
- **A Cloudflare Account:** You'll need a Cloudflare account and a domain name registered with Cloudflare. You can sign up for a free account at [Cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
- **The `wrangler` CLI:** The Wrangler CLI is Cloudflare's command-line tool for managing Workers. Install it globally:

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
  # or
  yarn global add @cloudflare/wrangler
  ```

## Step 1: Setting up your Cloudflare Worker

First, create a new directory for your Cloudflare Worker. This directory will contain the code for your worker. Let's call it `worker`.

```plaintext
mkdir worker
cd worker
```

Next, initialize a new Wrangler project:

```plaintext
wrangler init
```

This will create a `wrangler.toml` file in your `worker` directory. This file contains configuration settings for your Cloudflare Worker, such as its name, type, and the routes it should handle.

## Step 2: Writing your Cloudflare Worker Code

Now, let's write the code for our Cloudflare Worker. Replace the contents of the `index.js` file (created by `wrangler init`) with the following example. This example demonstrates a simple A/B test where we return different content based on a cookie:

```plaintext
// worker/index.js

addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Respond to the request
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)

  // Example: Cookie-based A/B testing
  const cookie = request.headers.get('cookie')
  let variant = 'A'

  if (cookie && cookie.includes('variant=B')) {
    variant = 'B'
  } else if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    variant = 'B'
  }

  let content
  if (variant === 'A') {
    content = `
      <h1>Variant A</h1>
      <p>This is the control group.  Welcome!</p>
    `
  } else {
    content = `
      <h1>Variant B</h1>
      <p>This is the test group.  Welcome!</p>
    `
  }

  const response = new Response(content, {
    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },
  })

  // Set a cookie if one doesn't exist
  if (!cookie || !cookie.includes('variant')) {
    response.headers.set('Set-Cookie', `variant=${variant}; path=/`)
  }

  return response
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `addEventListener('fetch', ...)` block registers a fetch event listener. This means that whenever a request is made to your Cloudflare Worker's route, this event listener will be triggered.
- The `handleRequest` function is the core of our worker. It takes the request object as input and returns a response object.
- We check for a `variant` cookie. If it exists and is set to "B", we use variant B. Otherwise, we randomly assign the user to either variant A or B and set the cookie accordingly.
- Finally, we construct an HTML response with different content based on the chosen variant.
- We set the `Set-Cookie` header to persist the user's variant across multiple requests.

## Step 3: Configuring your `wrangler.toml`

Update your `wrangler.toml` file to match the following structure. Replace `<YOUR_ZONE_ID>` and `<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>` with your actual Cloudflare Zone ID and Account ID, which you can find in the Cloudflare dashboard. Also replace `<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>` with the subdomain you want to use for your worker.

```toml
# wrangler.toml

name = "gatsby-edge"
type = "javascript"
account_id = "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>"
zone_id = "<YOUR_ZONE_ID>"
route = "<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.yourdomain.com/*"
workers_dev = false # Set to false for production deploys
compatibility_date = "2024-02-29"
```

**Key Configuration Options:**

- `name`: The name of your Cloudflare Worker.
- `type`: The type of worker. Use `"javascript"` for JavaScript workers.
- `account_id`: Your Cloudflare Account ID.
- `zone_id`: Your Cloudflare Zone ID (the ID of your domain).
- `route`: The route that your worker will handle. This example configures the worker to handle all requests to `yoursubdomain.yourdomain.com`. Make sure this is a subdomain you control. Using `yourdomain.com/*` will override your whole site, which is likely not what you want.
- `workers_dev`: Set to `true` for testing on the `*.workers.dev` subdomain, and `false` when deploying to your own domain.
- `compatibility_date`: Specifies the date that the Worker runtime will emulate. This ensures your worker behaves consistently over time. Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

## Step 4: Deploying your Cloudflare Worker

Now it's time to deploy your worker! Before deploying, you need to authenticate with Cloudflare using the Wrangler CLI:

```plaintext
wrangler login
```

This will open a browser window and prompt you to log in to your Cloudflare account. Once you're logged in, authorize Wrangler to access your Cloudflare account.

After successful login, you can deploy your worker using the following command:

```plaintext
wrangler publish
```

This will upload your worker code to Cloudflare and activate it on the specified route.

## Step 5: Configuring Gatsby to Utilize the Worker

Now that the worker is deployed, we need to adjust Gatsby to leverage it. This involves strategically directing requests to the worker based on our desired functionality. Since our example worker is doing A/B testing and not directly serving Gatsby assets, we wouldn't normally have Gatsby directly serving the worker. However, let's imagine we _did_ want to proxy some requests to the worker.

**Option 1: Proxying specific requests (Advanced)**

You can configure Gatsby to proxy specific requests to your Cloudflare Worker. This can be useful for dynamic content or API endpoints. We can't do this _directly_ from the Gatsby build process. This setup typically uses the worker to rewrite the response after Gatsby renders it.

Here's a more realistic example using a worker to inject a banner based on the country of the user:

**`worker/index.js`**

```plaintext
addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Get the response from the origin server (Gatsby in this case)
  const response = await fetch(request)

  // Clone the response so we can modify it
  const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response)

  // Check if the response is HTML
  if (newResponse.headers.get('content-type')?.includes('text/html')) {
    // Get the user's country from the CF-IPCountry header
    const country = request.headers.get('CF-IPCountry')

    // Add a banner based on the country
    let banner = ''
    if (country === 'US') {
      banner =
        '<div style="background-color: #f00; color: white; padding: 10px;">Welcome from the USA!</div>'
    } else if (country === 'CA') {
      banner =
        '<div style="background-color: #00f; color: white; padding: 10px;">Welcome from Canada!</div>'
    }

    // Read the HTML content
    let body = await newResponse.text()

    // Inject the banner at the top of the body
    body = body.replace('<body>', '<body>' + banner)

    // Update the response body and headers
    newResponse.headers.set('Content-Length', body.length)
    newResponse.headers.set('Content-Type', 'text/html')
    newResponse.body = body
    return new Response(body, newResponse)
  }

  return newResponse
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Fetch the Original Response:** The worker first fetches the original response from the Gatsby origin server. This is crucial because Gatsby is still responsible for generating the initial HTML.

2.  **Clone the Response:** We clone the response to create a new `Response` object that we can safely modify without affecting the original cached response.

3.  **Check Content Type:** We verify that the response is HTML before attempting to modify it. This avoids issues with other asset types like images or JavaScript files.

4.  **Retrieve User's Country:** We use the `CF-IPCountry` header, which Cloudflare automatically adds to requests, to determine the user's country.

5.  **Inject the Banner:** Based on the country, we create an HTML banner and inject it into the beginning of the `<body>` tag.

6.  **Update Headers:** We update the `Content-Length` header to reflect the new size of the HTML content and make sure `Content-Type` is correct.

7.  **Return the Response:** We return the modified response.

**Important:**

- **Route Configuration:** Ensure your `wrangler.toml` file has the correct route configured to intercept requests to your Gatsby site. For example, if you want the worker to process all requests to your domain: `route = "yourdomain.com/*"`. Be extremely careful with this as an error can take down your whole site.
- **Cloudflare Configuration:** Ensure Cloudflare is properly configured to route traffic to your origin server (where Gatsby's static files are hosted) when the worker _doesn't_ modify the request.

**Option 2: Using the Worker for Specific Tasks (More common)**

A more typical approach is to use the worker for specific tasks, such as handling form submissions or fetching data from an external API. In this case, your Gatsby site would make API requests to the worker, which would then handle the logic and return the result. This scenario doesn't require any special Gatsby configuration for serving pages. Instead, in your React components, you would make `fetch` requests to the worker's endpoint.

**Example: Form Submission via Worker**

Let's say you want to handle form submissions using a Cloudflare Worker to avoid exposing API keys in your Gatsby codebase.

**Gatsby Component (e.g., `src/components/ContactForm.js`):**

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const ContactForm = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('')
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false)
  const [submissionResult, setSubmissionResult] = useState(null)

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    setIsSubmitting(true)

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/contact-worker', {
        // Adjust route as needed
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ name, email, message }),
      })

      const data = await response.json()
      setSubmissionResult(data)
    } catch (error) {
      setSubmissionResult({ success: false, message: 'An error occurred during submission.' })
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          id="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="message">Message:</label>
        <textarea
          id="message"
          value={message}
          onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
          required
        />
      </div>
      <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
        {isSubmitting ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
      </button>
      {submissionResult && (
        <div style={{ marginTop: '10px', color: submissionResult.success ? 'green' : 'red' }}>
          {submissionResult.message}
        </div>
      )}
    </form>
  )
}

export default ContactForm
```

**Cloudflare Worker (`worker/index.js`):**

```plaintext
addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url.endsWith('/.netlify/functions/contact-worker')) {
    // Check the path.
    try {
      const body = await request.json()
      const { name, email, message } = body

      // Replace with your actual email sending logic (e.g., using SendGrid, etc.)
      // This is a placeholder for demonstration purposes.  Do *NOT* hardcode real credentials here. Use environment variables!

      //  const apiKey =  __STATIC_CONTENT.API_KEY; // Example of accessing secrets in a worker.  Remember to bind the key.
      //  console.log(apiKey)
      console.log(`Sending email to ${email} with message: ${message}`)
      // Dummy success response
      return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({ success: true, message: 'Message sent successfully!' }),
        {
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        }
      )
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error processing form:', error)
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: false, message: 'Failed to send message.' }), {
        status: 500,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      })
    }
  }

  return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 })
}
```

**`wrangler.toml`**

```toml
name = "gatsby-contact-worker"
type = "javascript"
account_id = "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>"
zone_id = "<YOUR_ZONE_ID>"
route = "<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.yourdomain.com/.netlify/functions/contact-worker"
workers_dev = false
compatibility_date = "2024-02-29"
```

**Key improvements and explanations:**

- **Specific Route Matching:** The worker now _only_ processes requests to the `/.netlify/functions/contact-worker` path. This is critical for security and efficiency. It doesn't interfere with your Gatsby site's normal operation.
- **POST Request Handling:** The worker verifies that the request method is `POST`.
- **Error Handling:** Includes `try...catch` blocks for robust error handling. Returns a 500 status code for server errors.
- **JSON Parsing:** Parses the request body as JSON using `await request.json()`.
- **Headers:** Sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` for both success and error responses.
- **Clear Error Messages:** Provides more informative error messages.
- **Gatsby-side State Management:** The Gatsby component uses `useState` to manage the form state, submission status, and submission result.
- **`fetch` API:** The Gatsby component uses the `fetch` API to make a POST request to the worker's endpoint.
- **Disabled Submit Button:** Disables the submit button while the form is submitting to prevent multiple submissions.
- **Feedback:** Provides visual feedback to the user based on the submission result.
- **Security:** **Never commit API keys directly in your code!** The comment in the worker shows how to read secrets. You can do this through wrangler secrets or through Cloudflare environment variables.
- **Route:** The wrangler.toml route is now correctly set to intercept calls only at the specified endpoint, rather than the entire site.

This example demonstrates a safer and more realistic way to integrate a Cloudflare Worker with a Gatsby site. It focuses on a specific task (form submission) and handles errors gracefully.

## Step 6: Testing and Debugging

Cloudflare provides tools for testing and debugging your Workers:

- **`wrangler dev`:** Use `wrangler dev` to test your Worker locally before deploying it. This spins up a local development server that emulates the Cloudflare Workers runtime.
- **Cloudflare Dashboard:** The Cloudflare dashboard provides logs and metrics for your Workers, allowing you to monitor their performance and identify any issues.

## Benefits of Using Cloudflare Workers with Gatsby

- **Improved Performance:** Edge computing reduces latency by bringing computation closer to your users.
- **Enhanced Security:** Cloudflare provides DDoS protection, bot mitigation, and other security features.
- **Scalability:** Cloudflare's global network can handle a large volume of traffic without impacting performance.
- **Reduced Origin Server Load:** By offloading tasks to the edge, you can reduce the load on your origin server.
- **Personalization:** Serve personalized content based on user location, device, or other factors.
