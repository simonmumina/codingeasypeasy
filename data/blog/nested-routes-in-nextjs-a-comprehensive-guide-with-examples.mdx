# Nested Routes in Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Next.js, a popular React framework, simplifies web development with its powerful features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. One of its core strengths is its intuitive **file system routing system**, which makes creating complex navigation structures incredibly straightforward. In this guide, we'll dive deep into **nested routes in Next.js**, covering everything from basic nested layouts to dynamic and advanced routing scenarios.

## What are Nested Routes?

Nested routes allow you to create a hierarchical URL structure in your application. This is particularly useful for organizing content, managing user profiles, building e-commerce platforms, or any other website with a complex information architecture. Imagine you have a blog. You might want URLs like:

*   `/blog` (List of all blog posts)
*   `/blog/category/technology` (Posts under the "Technology" category)
*   `/blog/post/my-first-post` (A specific blog post)

These URL patterns demonstrate nested routing, where the `category` and `post` segments are nested within the `/blog` route.  Next.js's file system routing makes it a breeze to set this up.

## Basic Nested Routing: Folders and Files

The foundation of nested routing in Next.js lies in how you structure your files and folders within the `pages` directory.  Next.js automatically uses this directory structure to define your application's routes.

Let's start with a simple example. Suppose you want to create the `/blog` route.  Create a folder named `blog` inside the `pages` directory.  Inside the `blog` folder, create a file named `index.js` (or `.jsx` or `.tsx`).

```jsx
// pages/blog/index.js

function BlogIndex() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Blog!</h1>
      <p>Check out our latest posts.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogIndex;
```

This simple component will be rendered when you navigate to `/blog`. The `index.js` file within a directory acts as the default route for that directory.

Now, let's create the `/blog/about` route. Create a file named `about.js` inside the `blog` folder.

```jsx
// pages/blog/about.js

function BlogAbout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Our Blog</h1>
      <p>Learn more about what we do.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogAbout;
```

With these two files, you've established a basic nested route structure. Navigating to `/blog` will render the content of `pages/blog/index.js`, and navigating to `/blog/about` will render the content of `pages/blog/about.js`.

## Dynamic Routes: Catching Route Parameters

Real-world applications often require dynamic routes, where parts of the URL can vary. Think of blog posts with unique slugs or product pages with individual IDs. Next.js uses square brackets `[]` to define dynamic route segments.

Let's create a dynamic route for individual blog posts: `/blog/posts/[slug]`.

1.  **Create a `[slug].js` file:** Inside the `pages/blog/posts` folder, create a file named `[slug].js`.  This file will handle all routes matching the `/blog/posts/*` pattern. The `[slug]` part signifies a dynamic parameter named "slug".

2.  **Access the Route Parameter:** Use the `useRouter` hook from `next/router` to access the dynamic parameter.

```jsx
// pages/blog/posts/[slug].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Post: {slug}</h1>
      <p>Content of the blog post with slug: {slug}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogPost;
```

Now, if you navigate to `/blog/posts/my-first-post`, the `slug` variable will contain the value "my-first-post". You can then use this value to fetch the corresponding blog post from a database or API.

**Example with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for Static Site Generation (SSG):**

For better performance and SEO, consider using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to statically generate your dynamic routes.  This pre-renders the pages at build time, rather than on each request.

```jsx
// pages/blog/posts/[slug].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function BlogPost({ post }) { //  Now it receives post prop
  const router = useRouter();

  if (router.isFallback) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>; // Important for fallback: true
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Fetch a list of available slugs from your data source (database, API, etc.)
  const posts = [
    { slug: 'my-first-post' },
    { slug: 'second-article' },
    { slug: 'another-blog' },
  ];

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false, //  Can also be 'blocking' or true
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { slug } = params;

  // Fetch the blog post data based on the slug
  //  Example:  Fetch from an API or read from a file
  const post = {
    title: `Title of ${slug}`,
    content: `This is the content for the blog post with slug: ${slug}`,
    slug: slug,
  };

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}

export default BlogPost;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`getStaticPaths`:**  This function defines the possible values for the `slug` parameter that should be statically generated.  It returns an array of objects, where each object has a `params` property containing the `slug`.  `fallback: false` means that if a user tries to access a slug that is *not* in the `paths` array, they'll see a 404 error.  `fallback: true` will serve a fallback page initially (e.g., a loading state) and attempt to generate the page on-demand; you'll need to handle the `router.isFallback` state in your component.  `fallback: 'blocking'` behaves similarly to `true` but blocks the request until the page is generated.
*   **`getStaticProps`:** This function fetches the data needed for a specific route. It receives the `params` object from `getStaticPaths` and uses the `slug` to fetch the corresponding blog post.  The fetched data is then passed as props to the `BlogPost` component.

**Important Considerations for Dynamic Routes:**

*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling in `getStaticProps` to gracefully handle cases where data fetching fails.
*   **Data Fetching:** Choose the appropriate data fetching method based on your application's needs (API calls, database queries, file system access).
*   **Fallback Pages:**  If using `fallback: true` or `'blocking'` in `getStaticPaths`, implement a fallback page to provide a good user experience while the page is being generated.

## Advanced Nested Routing: Catch-All Routes and Optional Catch-All Routes

Next.js offers even more flexible routing options with catch-all and optional catch-all routes.

**Catch-All Routes (`[...slug].js`)**

A catch-all route allows you to match any number of segments after a specific path.  For example, `pages/blog/posts/[...slug].js` will match:

*   `/blog/posts/a`
*   `/blog/posts/a/b`
*   `/blog/posts/a/b/c`
*   ...and so on.

The `slug` parameter will be an array containing the segments.

```jsx
// pages/blog/posts/[...slug].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  // slug will be an array of route parameters.
  // Example: /blog/posts/a/b/c  =>  slug = ['a', 'b', 'c']

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Catch-All Blog Post</h1>
      <p>Segments: {slug ? slug.join(', ') : 'No segments'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogPost;
```

**Optional Catch-All Routes (`[[...slug]].js`)**

An optional catch-all route is similar to a catch-all route, but it also matches the path *without* any additional segments.  For example, `pages/blog/posts/[[...slug]].js` will match:

*   `/blog/posts`
*   `/blog/posts/a`
*   `/blog/posts/a/b`
*   ...and so on.

```jsx
// pages/blog/posts/[[...slug]].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  // slug will be an array of route parameters or undefined if no segments are present.
  // Example: /blog/posts/a/b/c  =>  slug = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  // Example: /blog/posts  => slug = undefined

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Optional Catch-All Blog Post</h1>
      <p>Segments: {slug ? slug.join(', ') : 'No segments'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogPost;
```

Optional catch-all routes are handy for creating pages with optional parameters or flexible content structures.

## Example: Building a Product Catalog with Nested Routes

Let's illustrate how to use nested routes to build a product catalog. We want URLs like:

*   `/products` (List of all products)
*   `/products/category/electronics` (Products in the "Electronics" category)
*   `/products/[productId]` (A specific product with a unique ID)

Here's how you'd structure your `pages` directory:

```
pages/
├── products/
│   ├── index.js         // List of all products
│   ├── category/
│   │   └── [category].js  // Products in a specific category
│   └── [productId].js     // A specific product
```

**`pages/products/index.js`**

```jsx
// pages/products/index.js
import Link from 'next/link';

function ProductList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>All Products</h1>
      <p>Browse our entire product selection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><Link href="/products/123">Product 123</Link></li>
        <li><Link href="/products/456">Product 456</Link></li>
        <li><Link href="/products/category/electronics">Electronics</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProductList;
```

**`pages/products/category/[category].js`**

```jsx
// pages/products/category/[category].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function CategoryPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { category } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products in Category: {category}</h1>
      <p>Displaying products for the {category} category.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CategoryPage;
```

**`pages/products/[productId].js`**

```jsx
// pages/products/[productId].js

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function ProductPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { productId } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product ID: {productId}</h1>
      <p>Displaying details for product {productId}.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProductPage;
```

This structure demonstrates a practical use case of nested routes, allowing you to easily navigate and display products based on different criteria.
