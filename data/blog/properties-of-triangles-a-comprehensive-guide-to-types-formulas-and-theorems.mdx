# Properties of Triangles: A Comprehensive Guide to Types, Formulas, and Theorems

Triangles are among the most fundamental shapes in geometry, and understanding their properties is crucial for success in mathematics and related fields. From architecture to engineering, triangles are everywhere. This guide will delve into the various properties of triangles, covering their types, formulas, and key theorems.

## What is a Triangle?

A triangle is a closed, two-dimensional shape with three sides and three angles. The word "triangle" literally means "three angles".

## Types of Triangles

Triangles are classified based on their side lengths and angles. Let's explore the different types:

### 1. Based on Side Lengths

*   **Equilateral Triangle:** All three sides are equal in length.  Consequently, all three angles are also equal, each measuring 60 degrees.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Checking if a triangle is equilateral
    function isEquilateral(side1, side2, side3) {
      return side1 === side2 && side2 === side3;
    }

    console.log(isEquilateral(5, 5, 5)); // true
    console.log(isEquilateral(5, 6, 5)); // false
    ```

*   **Isosceles Triangle:** Two sides are equal in length. The angles opposite these equal sides (called base angles) are also equal.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Checking if a triangle is isosceles
    function isIsosceles(side1, side2, side3) {
      return side1 === side2 || side1 === side3 || side2 === side3;
    }

    console.log(isIsosceles(5, 5, 6)); // true
    console.log(isIsosceles(5, 6, 7)); // false
    ```

*   **Scalene Triangle:** All three sides are of different lengths, and all three angles are of different measures.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Checking if a triangle is scalene
    function isScalene(side1, side2, side3) {
      return side1 !== side2 && side1 !== side3 && side2 !== side3;
    }

    console.log(isScalene(5, 6, 7)); // true
    console.log(isScalene(5, 5, 7)); // false
    ```

### 2. Based on Angle Measures

*   **Right Triangle:** One angle is a right angle (90 degrees). The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called legs.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Checking if a triangle is a right triangle (using Pythagorean Theorem)
    function isRightTriangle(side1, side2, hypotenuse) {
      return side1 * side1 + side2 * side2 === hypotenuse * hypotenuse;
    }

    console.log(isRightTriangle(3, 4, 5)); // true
    console.log(isRightTriangle(3, 5, 6)); // false
    ```

*   **Acute Triangle:** All three angles are acute angles (less than 90 degrees).

*   **Obtuse Triangle:** One angle is an obtuse angle (greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees).

## Key Properties and Theorems of Triangles

### 1. Angle Sum Property

The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees. This fundamental property is crucial for solving many triangle-related problems.

```javascript
// Example: Checking the angle sum property
function checkAngleSum(angle1, angle2, angle3) {
  return angle1 + angle2 + angle3 === 180;
}

console.log(checkAngleSum(60, 60, 60)); // true
console.log(checkAngleSum(90, 45, 45)); // true
console.log(checkAngleSum(50, 70, 80)); // false
```

### 2. Triangle Inequality Theorem

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.  This theorem ensures that a triangle can actually be formed from the given side lengths.

```javascript
// Example: Checking the triangle inequality theorem
function isPossibleTriangle(side1, side2, side3) {
  return (
    side1 + side2 > side3 &&
    side1 + side3 > side2 &&
    side2 + side3 > side1
  );
}

console.log(isPossibleTriangle(3, 4, 5)); // true
console.log(isPossibleTriangle(1, 2, 5)); // false
```

### 3. Pythagorean Theorem

This theorem applies only to right triangles. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (legs).  Expressed as an equation: a² + b² = c², where 'c' is the hypotenuse and 'a' and 'b' are the legs.

```javascript
// Example: Calculating the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem
function calculateHypotenuse(side1, side2) {
  return Math.sqrt(side1 * side1 + side2 * side2);
}

console.log(calculateHypotenuse(3, 4)); // 5
```

### 4. Area of a Triangle

There are several formulas for calculating the area of a triangle, depending on the information available:

*   **Base and Height:** Area = (1/2) * base * height.  The height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Calculating area using base and height
    function calculateAreaBaseHeight(base, height) {
      return 0.5 * base * height;
    }

    console.log(calculateAreaBaseHeight(4, 5)); // 10
    ```

*   **Heron's Formula:** When you know the lengths of all three sides (a, b, c), you can use Heron's formula:

    *   Calculate the semi-perimeter (s): s = (a + b + c) / 2
    *   Area = √(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

    ```javascript
    // Example: Calculating area using Heron's formula
    function calculateAreaHeron(side1, side2, side3) {
      const s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2;
      return Math.sqrt(s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3));
    }

    console.log(calculateAreaHeron(5, 6, 7)); // 14.696938456699069
    ```

*   **Two Sides and Included Angle:** Area = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C), where a and b are the lengths of two sides, and C is the angle between them.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Calculating area using two sides and an included angle (in degrees)
    function calculateAreaSideAngleSide(side1, side2, angleDegrees) {
      const angleRadians = angleDegrees * Math.PI / 180; // Convert degrees to radians
      return 0.5 * side1 * side2 * Math.sin(angleRadians);
    }

    console.log(calculateAreaSideAngleSide(5, 6, 30)); // 7.499999999999999
    ```

### 5. Perimeter of a Triangle

The perimeter of a triangle is simply the sum of the lengths of all three sides.

```javascript
// Example: Calculating the perimeter
function calculatePerimeter(side1, side2, side3) {
  return side1 + side2 + side3;
}

console.log(calculatePerimeter(3, 4, 5)); // 12
```

## Congruence and Similarity of Triangles

*   **Congruent Triangles:** Two triangles are congruent if they have the same shape and size.  This means all corresponding sides and angles are equal. There are several congruence criteria:
    *   **SSS (Side-Side-Side):**  If all three sides of one triangle are equal to the corresponding three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
    *   **SAS (Side-Angle-Side):**  If two sides and the included angle (the angle between those two sides) of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two sides and included angle of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
    *   **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle):**  If two angles and the included side (the side between those two angles) of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
    *   **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side):** If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and non-included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
    *   **RHS (Right-Hypotenuse-Side):**  If the hypotenuse and one side of a right triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and corresponding side of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

*   **Similar Triangles:** Two triangles are similar if they have the same shape but may be different sizes.  This means their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are in proportion. There are several similarity criteria:
    *   **AAA (Angle-Angle-Angle):**  If all three angles of one triangle are equal to the corresponding three angles of another triangle, then the triangles are similar.
    *   **SAS (Side-Angle-Side):** If two sides of one triangle are proportional to the corresponding two sides of another triangle, and the included angles are equal, then the triangles are similar.
    *   **SSS (Side-Side-Side):** If all three sides of one triangle are proportional to the corresponding three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are similar.
