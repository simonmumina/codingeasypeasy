**Code Example (Bash script for installing Apache on an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update the package index
sudo yum update -y

# Install Apache
sudo yum install httpd -y

# Start Apache
sudo systemctl start httpd

# Enable Apache to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable httpd

# Open port 80 in the firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Verify Apache is running
systemctl status httpd
```

**Cost Considerations:**

*   EC2 instance type (size, CPU, memory)
*   Storage (EBS volumes)
*   Data transfer
*   Reserved Instances or Savings Plans can significantly reduce costs for predictable workloads.

## Apache on ECS (Elastic Container Service)

**Cons:**

*   **Containerization Required:** Requires your application to be containerized using Docker.
*   **Learning Curve:** Understanding containerization concepts and ECS terminology can take time.
*   **Less Control:**  You have less control over the underlying infrastructure compared to EC2.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Microservices Architectures:** Ideal for deploying and managing microservices-based applications.
*   **Modern Web Applications:** Suitable for modern web applications that are built with containerization in mind.
*   **Applications Requiring High Scalability:**  ECS provides excellent scalability for applications with fluctuating traffic.

**Code Example (Dockerfile for creating an Apache image):**

```dockerfile
# Use the official Apache image as a base
FROM httpd:2.4

# Copy your website files to the document root
COPY ./website /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Optional: Configure Apache (e.g., using a custom httpd.conf)
# COPY ./httpd.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
```

**Code Example (ECS Task Definition - example JSON):**

```json
{
  "family": "apache-task",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "apache-container",
      "image": "your-dockerhub-username/apache-web-server:latest",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "hostPort": 80,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ],
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256
    }
  ],
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "requiresCompatibilities": [
    "FARGATE"
  ],
  "cpu": "256",
  "memory": "512",
  "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"
}
```

**Cost Considerations:**

*   ECS cluster infrastructure (EC2 instances or Fargate)
*   Data transfer
*   Elastic Load Balancing
*   Container Registry storage (if using ECR)

**ECS Fargate vs ECS EC2:**
