# Mastering useRouter: A Comprehensive Guide to Next.js Routing

The `useRouter` hook in Next.js is a powerful and essential tool for handling client-side navigation and accessing route information within your components. It provides access to the Next.js router object, allowing you to programmatically change routes, retrieve query parameters, and build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. This guide will provide a detailed exploration of the `useRouter` hook, equipping you with the knowledge and practical examples to effectively utilize it in your Next.js applications.

## What is useRouter?

The `useRouter` hook, imported from `next/router`, is a React hook that allows you to access the Next.js router object within your functional components. This router object provides properties and methods related to the current route, enabling you to:

- **Navigate programmatically:** Redirect users to different pages within your application.
- **Access query parameters:** Retrieve values passed in the URL (e.g., `?id=123`).
- **Get information about the current route:** Access the current pathname, asPath, and other route-related properties.
- **Handle routing events:** Subscribe to events like route changes, allowing you to perform actions after a navigation.

## Getting Started: Importing useRouter

Before you can use `useRouter`, you need to import it from the `next/router` module:

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
```

## Basic Usage: Accessing Route Information

Let's start with a simple example. Suppose you want to display the current pathname in your component.

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Path: {router.pathname}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example, `router.pathname` will display the current URL path, such as `/about`, `/products`, or `/`. The `useRouter()` hook returns the router object, which we assign to the `router` variable. We can then access properties like `pathname`, `query`, and `asPath`.

Here's a breakdown of common properties available on the `router` object:

- **`router.pathname`:** The path section of the URL. This is the part before the query parameters (e.g., `/blog/my-post`).
- **`router.query`:** An object containing the query parameters. For example, if the URL is `/products?category=electronics&sort=price`, `router.query` would be `{ category: 'electronics', sort: 'price' }`.
- **`router.asPath`:** The path as displayed in the browser's address bar, including the query string and hash. (e.g., `/products?category=electronics&sort=price`).
- **`router.isReady`:** A boolean indicating whether the router has finished its initial initialization. It's useful to check this before accessing `router.query` or `router.pathname` on the first render, especially when working with dynamic routes.
- **`router.basePath`:** The configured `basePath` for your Next.js application (if defined in `next.config.js`).

## Navigating Programmatically: router.push()

The `router.push()` method allows you to navigate users to different routes programmatically. This is incredibly useful for creating dynamic navigation links, handling form submissions, and implementing custom routing logic.

**Basic Example:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function MyButton() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/about')
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About Page</button>
}

export default MyButton
```

Clicking the "Go to About Page" button will navigate the user to the `/about` route.

**Passing Query Parameters:**

You can also include query parameters when navigating:

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function ProductButton({ productId }) {
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push({
      pathname: '/product/[id]',
      query: { id: productId },
    })
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>View Product {productId}</button>
}

export default ProductButton
```

In this example, we are navigating to the dynamic route `/product/[id]` and passing the `productId` as a query parameter. This is how you would typically navigate to a dynamic route.

**Important Note on Dynamic Routes:** When using `router.push()` with dynamic routes, you need to provide both the `pathname` and `query`. The `pathname` should point to the route with the bracket notation (e.g., `/product/[id]`), and the `query` object should contain the values for the dynamic segments (e.g., `{ id: productId }`). Next.js will automatically handle the URL resolution.

**Using `as` for a different URL:**

The `as` prop allows you to display a different URL in the browser's address bar than the actual route you're navigating to. This can be useful for creating user-friendly URLs or for hiding internal route details.

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function ArticleButton({ articleId }) {
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push(
      {
        pathname: '/article/[id]',
        query: { id: articleId },
      },
      `/articles/${articleId}` // as path
    )
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>View Article {articleId}</button>
}

export default ArticleButton
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the user will navigate to the internal route `/article/[id]` with the `id` query parameter, but the browser's address bar will display `/articles/${articleId}`. This is useful for creating more SEO-friendly URLs.

**`router.replace()` vs. `router.push()`:**

- **`router.push()`:** Adds a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous page using the browser's back button.
- **`router.replace()`:** Replaces the current entry in the browser's history stack. The user cannot navigate back to the previous page using the browser's back button. This is useful for situations where you want to prevent the user from returning to a specific page, such as after a successful form submission.

## Accessing Query Parameters: router.query

As mentioned earlier, `router.query` provides access to the query parameters in the URL. This is especially useful for dynamic routes and filtering data based on user input.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a page `/blog/[slug].js` and the URL is `/blog/my-first-post?utm_source=google`. Here's how you can access the `slug` and `utm_source` parameters:

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { slug, utm_source } = router.query

  if (!router.isReady) {
    return <p>Loading...</p> // Important to handle initial loading
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Post: {slug}</h1>
      {utm_source && <p>UTM Source: {utm_source}</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

export default BlogPost
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **`router.isReady`:** It's crucial to check `router.isReady` before accessing `router.query`, especially on the initial render. The `router` object might not be fully initialized when the component first mounts, and `router.query` might be an empty object or `undefined`. The example above demonstrates how to handle this situation by displaying a loading message until the router is ready.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript users should consider defining types for the expected query parameters to ensure type safety and prevent errors.

## Handling Routing Events

The `useRouter` hook also allows you to subscribe to routing events. This can be useful for performing actions when a route changes, such as logging analytics, updating the UI, or fetching new data.

Here's a list of the available router events:

- **`routeChangeStart`:** Fired when a route starts to change.
- **`routeChangeComplete`:** Fired when a route has completely changed.
- **`routeChangeError`:** Fired when there is an error during the route change.
- **`beforeHistoryChange`:** Fired before the browser history changes (pushState or replaceState).
- **`hashChangeStart`:** Fired when the hash portion of the URL starts to change.
- **`hashChangeComplete`:** Fired when the hash portion of the URL has completely changed.

You can subscribe to these events using `Router.events` (note the capital `R` for `Router`).

**Example:**

```plaintext
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import Router from 'next/router' // Import Router (capital R)

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
      console.log('Route changed to:', url)
      // You can also use analytics libraries here
    }

    Router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChange)

    // Unsubscribe from the event when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      Router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', handleRouteChange)
    }
  }, [])

  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

This example demonstrates how to subscribe to the `routeChangeComplete` event and log the new URL to the console. The `useEffect` hook is used to ensure that the event listener is registered only once when the component mounts and unregistered when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

## Advanced Usage and Best Practices

- **Conditional Navigation:** Use `useRouter` to conditionally navigate users based on specific criteria, such as authentication status or user roles.
- **Optimistic Updates:** When navigating, consider implementing optimistic updates to provide a smoother user experience. For example, you can update the UI to reflect the new route before the actual navigation is complete.
- **Error Handling:** Handle potential errors during navigation by using the `routeChangeError` event. This allows you to display error messages or redirect users to an error page.
- **Performance Optimization:** Be mindful of the performance implications of using `useRouter`. Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components that depend on the router object.
- **Link Component vs. useRouter:** In most cases, using the `<Link>` component from `next/link` is preferred for client-side navigation, as it provides performance optimizations like prefetching. `useRouter` should be reserved for cases where you need programmatic navigation or access to route information within your components.

## Conclusion

The `useRouter` hook is a fundamental tool for building dynamic and interactive Next.js applications. By mastering its capabilities, you can create sophisticated routing logic, handle query parameters, and respond to routing events. This guide has provided a comprehensive overview of the `useRouter` hook, along with practical examples and best practices to help you effectively utilize it in your projects. Remember to consider the performance implications and choose the appropriate navigation method ( `<Link>` vs. `useRouter`) based on your specific needs. Happy routing!
