# Mastering PUT Requests with XMLHttpRequest: Building a Custom HTTP Library

In modern web development, interacting with APIs is a fundamental requirement. While libraries like `fetch` and `axios` are readily available, understanding the underlying mechanics of HTTP requests is crucial for debugging, optimization, and building custom solutions. This post dives deep into using the `XMLHttpRequest` object in JavaScript to create a custom HTTP library, with a specific focus on implementing `PUT` requests for updating data on the server.

## What is XMLHttpRequest?

`XMLHttpRequest (XHR)` is a JavaScript object that allows you to make HTTP requests directly from the browser without needing to refresh the page. It's the foundation for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and allows for dynamic and interactive web applications. Although `fetch` API is more modern, understanding `XMLHttpRequest` provides a deeper insight into how HTTP requests work.

## Why Build a Custom HTTP Library?

While libraries like `fetch` and `axios` simplify HTTP requests, building a custom library offers several advantages:

- **Understanding the Fundamentals:** Gain a clear understanding of how HTTP requests are made at a low level.
- **Customization:** Tailor the library to your specific project needs, including error handling, authentication, and data transformation.
- **Reduced Dependency:** Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies to your project, especially for small or specialized tasks.
- **Debugging Prowess:** Understanding the inner workings of XHR makes you a more effective debugger of network requests.

## Understanding the PUT Request

The `PUT` method is an HTTP request method used to _replace_ an existing resource on the server. Unlike `POST`, which is used to create new resources, `PUT` is idempotent, meaning that making the same `PUT` request multiple times will have the same effect as making it once (provided the data doesn't change in between). It's commonly used to update existing data, sending the complete updated resource to the server.

## Building a Basic Custom HTTP Library

Let's start by creating a simple JavaScript file (e.g., `http.js`) to house our HTTP library. We'll define a basic object that will contain our `PUT` method.

```javascript
// http.js
const http = {
  put: function (url, data, callback) {
    // PUT request logic will go here
  },
}
```

## Implementing the PUT Request with XMLHttpRequest

Now, let's implement the `PUT` method using `XMLHttpRequest`.

```javascript
// http.js
const http = {
  put: function (url, data, callback) {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()

    xhr.open('PUT', url, true) // true for asynchronous

    // Set the content type
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/json') // Adjust if needed (e.g., 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded')

    xhr.onload = function () {
      if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
        // Successful response
        callback(null, xhr.responseText) // Pass null for error, response data
      } else {
        // Error handling
        callback('Request failed.  Returned status of ' + xhr.status) // Pass error message, no response data
      }
    }

    xhr.onerror = function () {
      callback('Network Error') // Handle network errors (e.g., no internet connection)
    }

    // Convert the data to JSON and send the request
    xhr.send(JSON.stringify(data)) // Ensure data is in the correct format
  },
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`new XMLHttpRequest()`:** Creates a new `XMLHttpRequest` object.
2.  **`xhr.open('PUT', url, true)`:** Initializes a new request. The first argument is the HTTP method (`PUT`), the second is the URL, and the third is a boolean indicating whether the request should be asynchronous (which is generally what you want).
3.  **`xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/json')`:** Sets the `Content-type` header of the request. This tells the server that we are sending data in JSON format. Adjust this based on the expected content type. If you're sending form data, it might be `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`.
4.  **`xhr.onload = function() { ... }`:** Defines a function to be called when the request completes successfully (status code between 200 and 299). Inside, it checks the `xhr.status` and calls the `callback` function with the response data. We pass `null` as the first argument (error), indicating success.
5.  **`xhr.onerror = function() { ... }`:** Defines a function to be called if there's a network error (e.g., the server is unreachable). It calls the `callback` function with an error message.
6.  **`xhr.send(JSON.stringify(data))`:** Sends the request to the server. `JSON.stringify(data)` converts the JavaScript object `data` into a JSON string. If you're sending form data, you'll need to format the data accordingly (e.g., using `encodeURIComponent`).

## Using the Custom HTTP Library

To use the `http.js` library, you first need to include it in your HTML file (or import it in your JavaScript module). Then, you can call the `put` method:

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>PUT Request Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="http.js"></script>
  <script>
    const data = {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Updated Post Title',
      body: 'This is the updated content of the post.'
    };

    http.put('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', data, function(err, response) {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error:', err);
      } else {
        console.log('Response:', response);
      }
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We define a `data` object containing the updated data for the post. Notice that we are including the `id` of the resource we want to update.
2.  We call the `http.put` method, passing the URL of the resource to update (e.g., a specific post on a blog), the `data` object, and a callback function.
3.  The callback function handles the response from the server. If there is an error, it logs the error to the console. Otherwise, it logs the response data to the console.

**Important:** Replace `"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"` with a real API endpoint that supports `PUT` requests. The `jsonplaceholder` API is great for testing, but remember it's a public API with rate limits.

## Handling Different Data Formats

The example above assumes you are sending data in JSON format. However, you might need to send data in other formats, such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. To support this, you would need to modify the `put` method to handle different data formats:

```javascript
// http.js
const http = {
  put: function (url, data, contentType, callback) {
    // Added contentType parameter
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()

    xhr.open('PUT', url, true)

    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type', contentType) // Use the provided content type

    xhr.onload = function () {
      if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
        callback(null, xhr.responseText)
      } else {
        callback('Request failed.  Returned status of ' + xhr.status)
      }
    }

    xhr.onerror = function () {
      callback('Network Error')
    }

    let dataToSend
    if (contentType === 'application/json') {
      dataToSend = JSON.stringify(data)
    } else if (contentType === 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded') {
      // Format data for form-urlencoded
      dataToSend = Object.keys(data)
        .map((key) => encodeURIComponent(key) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(data[key]))
        .join('&')
    } else {
      callback('Unsupported Content-Type')
      return
    }

    xhr.send(dataToSend)
  },
}
```

Now, you can specify the `Content-type` when calling the `put` method:

```javascript
const data = {
  title: 'Updated Post Title',
  body: 'This is the updated content of the post.',
}

http.put(
  'https://example.com/posts/1',
  data,
  'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  function (err, response) {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error:', err)
    } else {
      console.log('Response:', response)
    }
  }
)
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

Proper error handling is essential for a robust HTTP library. The `XMLHttpRequest` object provides the `status` property, which indicates the HTTP status code returned by the server. You should check the status code and handle different error scenarios accordingly. Common status codes include:

- **200 OK:** The request was successful.
- **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created (less common with PUT).
- **204 No Content:** The request was successful, but there is no content to return.
- **400 Bad Request:** The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized:** The request requires authentication.
- **403 Forbidden:** The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an unexpected condition.

You can enhance the error handling in your custom HTTP library to provide more informative error messages based on the status code.

## Handling Asynchronous Responses

`XMLHttpRequest` operates asynchronously by default, meaning that the code continues to execute without waiting for the server to respond. The callback function that you provide to the `put` method will be called when the server responds. This is crucial for avoiding blocking the main thread and keeping the user interface responsive.

## Security Considerations

When making HTTP requests, be mindful of security best practices:

- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the browser and the server. This protects sensitive data from being intercepted.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If your application makes requests to a different domain than the one it's hosted on, you need to configure CORS properly on the server. Otherwise, the browser will block the requests.
- **Input Validation:** Always validate user input on both the client and the server to prevent injection attacks.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Implement CSRF protection to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of your users.

## Refactoring for Readability and Maintainability

While our basic example works, we can refactor it to improve readability and maintainability. Consider extracting the request creation and handling logic into separate functions:

```javascript
const http = {
  put: function (url, data, contentType, callback) {
    this.makeRequest('PUT', url, data, contentType, callback)
  },

  makeRequest: function (method, url, data, contentType, callback) {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()

    xhr.open(method, url, true)
    xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type', contentType)

    xhr.onload = () => this.handleResponse(xhr, callback)
    xhr.onerror = () => callback('Network Error')

    let dataToSend
    if (contentType === 'application/json') {
      dataToSend = JSON.stringify(data)
    } else if (contentType === 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded') {
      dataToSend = Object.keys(data)
        .map((key) => encodeURIComponent(key) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(data[key]))
        .join('&')
    } else {
      callback('Unsupported Content-Type')
      return
    }

    xhr.send(dataToSend)
  },

  handleResponse: function (xhr, callback) {
    if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
      callback(null, xhr.responseText)
    } else {
      callback('Request failed.  Returned status of ' + xhr.status)
    }
  },
}
```

This refactoring makes the code more modular and easier to understand.

## Beyond the Basics: Adding Features

You can extend your custom HTTP library with additional features, such as:

- **Request Timeout:** Set a timeout for the request to prevent it from hanging indefinitely.
- **Authentication:** Add support for different authentication schemes, such as Basic Authentication or OAuth.
- **Progress Events:** Monitor the progress of the request (e.g., file uploads).
- **Interceptors:** Implement interceptors to modify requests and responses before they are sent or received.

## Conclusion

Building a custom HTTP library using `XMLHttpRequest` provides a valuable learning experience and allows you to tailor your HTTP requests to your specific needs. While modern alternatives like `fetch` and `axios` offer more convenient abstractions, understanding the underlying mechanics of `XMLHttpRequest` is crucial for becoming a proficient web developer. Remember to handle errors properly, consider security implications, and refactor your code for readability and maintainability. This guide focused on the `PUT` method, but you can easily extend your library to support other HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`. Good luck and happy coding!
