# FastAPI i18n: How to Add Multilingual Support (Internationalization) to Your API

In today's globalized world, building applications that cater to diverse audiences is crucial. Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) are key to achieving this. This blog post will guide you through adding multilingual support to your FastAPI application, making your API accessible to users around the world.

## What is Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)?

Before we dive into the implementation, let's clarify the terms:

- **Internationalization (i18n):** Designing and developing applications so that they can be adapted to various languages and regions without requiring engineering changes. It's about making the application _adaptable_. Think of it as enabling your application to be multilingual-ready. The "18" represents the number of letters between the 'i' and the 'n' in "internationalization."
- **Localization (l10n):** Adapting a product or content to a specific target market or locale. This involves translating text, adjusting date formats, currency symbols, and other locale-specific elements. It's about _adapting_ the application to a specific language and region. The "10" represents the number of letters between the 'l' and the 'n' in "localization."

In this guide, we'll focus on the i18n aspect of making our FastAPI application ready for localization.

## Setting up Your FastAPI Project

First, let's create a basic FastAPI application. If you already have one, you can skip this step.

```plaintext
mkdir fastapi_i18n_example
cd fastapi_i18n_example
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Create a file named `main.py` with the following content:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root(request: Request):
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

You can run this application using:

```plaintext
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Choosing an i18n Library for FastAPI

Several Python libraries can help with i18n. Some popular choices include:

- **Babel:** A widely used and feature-rich library that supports pluralization, date formatting, and message translation.
- **gettext:** A standard Unix library that provides functions for retrieving translated messages. Often used with `.po` and `.mo` files.
- **FastAPI-i18next:** A FastAPI extension that simplifies the integration of `i18next`, a popular JavaScript i18n library, into your FastAPI application. This is often a good choice if you're using `i18next` in your frontend.

For this tutorial, we'll use **Babel** because it's well-established and provides a comprehensive set of features. Install it using:

```plaintext
pip install babel
```

## Implementing i18n with Babel

Here's how we can add i18n support to our FastAPI application using Babel:

### 1. Project Structure and Translation Files

Let's create a directory structure to organize our translation files:

```
fastapi_i18n_example/
├── main.py
└── locales/
    ├── en/
    │   └── LC_MESSAGES/
    │       └── messages.po
    └── fr/
        └── LC_MESSAGES/
            └── messages.po
```

- `locales/`: This directory will hold our translation files for different languages.
- `en/` and `fr/`: These subdirectories represent the language codes for English and French, respectively.
- `LC_MESSAGES/`: This is a standard directory structure for gettext-style translation files.
- `messages.po`: This file contains the actual translations. It's a human-readable text file with source strings and their corresponding translations.

### 2. Creating `messages.po` Files

Let's create the `messages.po` files.

**locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po:**

```po
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: fastapi_i18n_example\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2024-10-27 10:00+0000\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: 2024-10-27 10:00+0000\n"
"Last-Translator: \n"
"Language-Team: \n"
"Language: en\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=1; plural=0;\n"

msgid "Hello, World!"
msgstr "Hello, World!"

msgid "Welcome, %s!"
msgstr "Welcome, %s!"

msgid "User not found"
msgstr "User not found"
```

**locales/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po:**

```po
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: fastapi_i18n_example\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2024-10-27 10:00+0000\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: 2024-10-27 10:00+0000\n"
"Last-Translator: \n"
"Language-Team: \n"
"Language: fr\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n > 1);\n"

msgid "Hello, World!"
msgstr "Bonjour le monde !"

msgid "Welcome, %s!"
msgstr "Bienvenue, %s !"

msgid "User not found"
msgstr "Utilisateur introuvable"
```

**Explanation:**

- `msgid`: The original string in the default language (usually English).
- `msgstr`: The translated string in the target language.

### 3. Compiling `.po` Files to `.mo` Files

The `.po` files are human-readable, but the `gettext` library uses compiled binary files called `.mo` files for faster lookup. We need to compile the `.po` files into `.mo` files.

```plaintext
msgfmt locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po -o locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo
msgfmt locales/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po -o locales/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo
```

You may need to install `gettext` tools if you don't already have them. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install gettext`. On macOS, you can use `brew install gettext`.

### 4. Integrating with FastAPI

Now, let's modify `main.py` to integrate with Babel and `gettext`:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from babel import Locale
import gettext
import os

app = FastAPI()

LOCALES_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "locales")
DEFAULT_LOCALE = "en"  # Default language
SUPPORTED_LOCALES = ["en", "fr"] # Supported languages

def get_locale(request: Request) -> str:
    """
    Detects the locale from the request headers (Accept-Language) or a query parameter.
    Falls back to the default locale if none is found or supported.
    """
    # Check for a query parameter (e.g., ?lang=fr)
    lang_query = request.query_params.get("lang")
    if lang_query and lang_query in SUPPORTED_LOCALES:
        return lang_query

    # Check Accept-Language header
    accept_language = request.headers.get("accept-language")
    if accept_language:
        for language in accept_language.split(","):
            lang_code = language.split(";")[0].strip()
            if lang_code in SUPPORTED_LOCALES:
                return lang_code

    return DEFAULT_LOCALE


def get_translation(locale: str) -> gettext.GNUTranslations:
    """
    Loads the appropriate translation based on the locale.
    """
    try:
        translation = gettext.translation(
            "messages",
            LOCALES_DIR,
            languages=[locale]
        )
    except FileNotFoundError:
        translation = gettext.translation(
            "messages",
            LOCALES_DIR,
            languages=[DEFAULT_LOCALE]
        )
    return translation

class I18nMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """
    Middleware to set the translation object in the request state.
    """
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        locale = get_locale(request)
        translation = get_translation(locale)
        request.state.locale = locale
        request.state.translate = translation.gettext
        response = await call_next(request)
        return response

app.add_middleware(I18nMiddleware)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root(request: Request):
    """
    Example endpoint that uses the translation.
    """
    translate = request.state.translate
    return {"message": translate("Hello, World!")}

@app.get("/greet/{name}")
async def greet(name: str, request: Request):
    """
    Example endpoint that uses the translation with a variable.
    """
    translate = request.state.translate
    return {"message": translate("Welcome, %s!" % name)}


@app.get("/error")
async def error_example(request: Request):
    """
    Example endpoint that returns a translated error message.
    """
    translate = request.state.translate
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=translate("User not found"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

- **Import Statements:** We import necessary modules from `fastapi`, `babel`, `gettext` and `starlette`.
- **`LOCALES_DIR`:** Defines the directory where our translation files are located.
- **`DEFAULT_LOCALE` and `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`:** Defines the default language and a list of languages our application supports.
- **`get_locale(request: Request)`:** This function determines the user's preferred language. It first checks for a `lang` query parameter (e.g., `/endpoint?lang=fr`). If no query parameter is provided, it looks at the `Accept-Language` header in the request. If neither is present, it falls back to the `DEFAULT_LOCALE`.
- **`get_translation(locale: str)`:** This function loads the appropriate translation file based on the detected locale using `gettext.translation`. It uses a try-except block to handle cases where a translation file for the specific locale is not found, falling back to the default language.
- **`I18nMiddleware`:** This middleware is crucial. It's responsible for:
  - Determining the locale using `get_locale(request)`.
  - Loading the translation object using `get_translation(locale)`.
  - Storing the locale and the `translate` function (bound to the loaded translation) in the request's state (`request.state`). This makes the translation function easily accessible in your route handlers.
- **`app.add_middleware(I18nMiddleware)`:** Registers the middleware with the FastAPI application.
- **Route Handlers (`read_root`, `greet`, `error_example`):** These are example route handlers that demonstrate how to use the `translate` function from the request state to translate strings. Note how we access the `translate` function using `request.state.translate`.

### 5. Testing the Application

Now, run the application:

```plaintext
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Try the following URLs in your browser or using `curl`:

- `http://localhost:8000/`: Should display "Hello, World!" (or the default language translation).
- `http://localhost:8000/?lang=fr`: Should display "Bonjour le monde !"
- `http://localhost:8000/greet/Alice`: Should display "Welcome, Alice!" (or the default language translation).
- `http://localhost:8000/greet/Alice?lang=fr`: Should display "Bienvenue, Alice !"
- `http://localhost:8000/error`: Should return a 404 error with the message "User not found" in the default language.
- `http://localhost:8000/error?lang=fr`: Should return a 404 error with the message "Utilisateur introuvable".

You can also set the `Accept-Language` header in your browser's developer tools or using `curl` to test locale detection based on headers. For example:

```plaintext
curl -H "Accept-Language: fr-FR,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7" http://localhost:8000/
```

This should return the French translation.

## Best Practices for FastAPI i18n

- **Use a consistent translation key strategy:** Develop a system for naming your translation keys (the `msgid` values) to ensure consistency throughout your application. For example, you could use a hierarchical structure like `module.component.message`.
- **Externalize all strings:** Avoid hardcoding strings directly into your Python code. Always use the translation function to retrieve text.
- **Use a translation management system (TMS):** For larger projects, consider using a TMS like Phrase, Lokalise, or Transifex to manage your translations. These tools can help streamline the translation workflow, track progress, and ensure consistency.
- **Pluralization:** Babel supports pluralization rules for different languages. Use the `ngettext` function for handling plural forms. This is especially important for languages like French which have different pluralization rules than English.
- **Date and Number Formatting:** Use Babel's date and number formatting capabilities to display dates, times, and numbers according to the user's locale. The `babel.dates` and `babel.numbers` modules provide functions for this.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your application with different locales to ensure that translations are displayed correctly and that all locale-specific formatting is working as expected.
- **Consider User Preferences:** Allow users to explicitly select their preferred language through a settings page or profile. This can override the automatic locale detection.
- **Use ICU Message Syntax (Optional):** ICU Message Syntax (supported by Babel) provides a powerful way to handle complex messages with placeholders, pluralization, and gender-specific forms. It's a more advanced option but can greatly simplify complex translation scenarios.

## Conclusion

Adding multilingual support to your FastAPI application is an important step towards making it accessible to a global audience. By using libraries like Babel and following best practices, you can create APIs that are easily localizable and provide a better user experience for users around the world. Remember to carefully plan your project structure, choose appropriate translation keys, and thoroughly test your application with different locales. This guide provides a solid foundation for implementing i18n in your FastAPI project. Good luck!
