# React Native OTA Updates: Mastering App Updates with CodePush for Seamless User Experience

In the fast-paced world of mobile app development, quickly delivering bug fixes and new features is crucial. Requiring users to download a new app version from the app store for every minor update can be frustrating and lead to churn. Fortunately, React Native offers a powerful solution: Over-The-Air (OTA) updates using services like CodePush. This blog post will guide you through implementing CodePush in your React Native application, enabling seamless updates and a better user experience.

## What are OTA Updates?

OTA updates, short for Over-The-Air updates, allow you to push JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and image assets directly to users' devices without requiring them to download a new version from the app store (Google Play or Apple App Store). This is incredibly beneficial for:

- **Bug Fixes:** Quickly deploy critical bug fixes without the delay of app store review processes.
- **Feature Enhancements:** Introduce new features and improvements to your users without requiring a full app update.
- **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different features and UI elements by pushing different code bundles to different user segments.
- **Instant Updates:** Provide near-instant updates, ensuring users have the latest version of your app.

## Introducing CodePush

CodePush is a cloud service provided by Microsoft that enables React Native developers to deploy mobile app updates directly to their usersâ€™ devices. It works by serving as a central repository where you publish your JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and image changes. When a user opens the app, the CodePush SDK checks for updates and downloads them in the background. The app then restarts with the new code.

## Setting Up CodePush

Here's a step-by-step guide to integrating CodePush into your React Native project:

### 1. Install the CodePush CLI:

First, install the CodePush command-line interface (CLI) globally using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install -g code-push-cli
# or
yarn global add code-push-cli
```

### 2. Create a CodePush Account:

Sign in to CodePush using your Microsoft account or GitHub account:

```plaintext
code-push login
```

### 3. Register Your React Native App with CodePush:

Register your React Native apps (both iOS and Android) with CodePush. This will generate deployment keys for each platform:

```plaintext
code-push app add MyApp-iOS ios react-native
code-push app add MyApp-Android android react-native
```

Replace `MyApp-iOS` and `MyApp-Android` with your actual app names. You'll receive two deployment keys, one for iOS and one for Android. Store these securely; you'll need them later.

### 4. Install the CodePush React Native SDK:

Install the `react-native-code-push` package in your React Native project:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-code-push
# or
yarn add react-native-code-push
```

### 5. Link the CodePush Library:

Link the native dependencies for CodePush. For React Native versions below 0.60, use `react-native link`. For React Native 0.60 and above, auto-linking should handle this automatically. However, it's a good practice to verify.

**iOS (Manual Linking if Needed):**

- Open your project in Xcode.
- Drag `RCTCodepush.xcodeproj` from `node_modules/react-native-code-push/ios` to your Libraries group in Xcode.
- In your project's "Build Phases", under "Link Binary With Libraries", add `libRCTCodepush.a`.
- Add a new build phase of type "Copy Files".
- Set "Destination" to "Products Directory".
- Add `CodePush.plist` from `node_modules/react-native-code-push/ios` to this build phase.

**Android (Manual Linking if Needed):**

- **`android/settings.gradle:`**

  ```plaintext
  include ':app', ':react-native-code-push'
  project(':react-native-code-push').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-code-push/android/app')
  ```

- **`android/app/build.gradle:`**

  ```plaintext
  dependencies {
      implementation project(':react-native-code-push')
  }
  ```

- **`android/app/src/main/java/<your_package_name>/MainApplication.java:`**

  ```plaintext
  import com.microsoft.codepush.react.CodePush;

  public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
      @Override
      protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
          @SuppressWarnings("UnnecessaryLocalVariable")
          List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
          // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
          // packages.add(new MyReactNativePackage());
          return packages;
      }

      @Override
      protected String getJSMainModuleName() {
          return "index";
      }

      @Override
      protected String getJSBundleFile() {
          return CodePush.getJSBundleFile();
      }
  }
  ```

### 6. Configure Deployment Keys in Your App:

Add the deployment keys to your app's configuration files:

**iOS (Info.plist):**

Open `Info.plist` in Xcode and add a new key named `CodePushDeploymentKey` with the value set to your iOS deployment key obtained from the CodePush CLI. If you want to use different deployments (e.g., staging and production), you can configure the deployment key based on your build configuration.

**Android (strings.xml):**

Open `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and add the following:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">MyApp</string>
    <string name="CodePushDeploymentKey">YOUR_ANDROID_DEPLOYMENT_KEY</string>
</resources>
```

Replace `YOUR_ANDROID_DEPLOYMENT_KEY` with your Android deployment key. Similar to iOS, you can use different `strings.xml` files for different build types (e.g., debug, release) to use different deployment keys.

### 7. Wrap Your Root Component with `codePush`:

Wrap your root component in your React Native app with the `codePush` higher-order component. This enables CodePush to manage updates for your app. Typically, this is done in `App.js` or `index.js`.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import codePush from 'react-native-code-push'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Hello, CodePush!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

let codePushOptions = { checkFrequency: codePush.CheckFrequency.ON_APP_RESUME }

export default codePush(codePushOptions)(App)
```

**Explanation:**

- `codePushOptions`: This object configures how CodePush checks for updates.
  - `checkFrequency`: Specifies how often CodePush should check for updates. `codePush.CheckFrequency.ON_APP_RESUME` (recommended for most cases) checks for updates every time the app resumes from the background. Other options include `ON_APP_START` and `MANUAL`.
- `codePush(codePushOptions)(App)`: This wraps your `App` component with the `codePush` higher-order component, enabling CodePush functionality.

### Advanced Configuration Options for `codePushOptions`:

Here are some more advanced configuration options that you can use:

- `installMode`: Determines when the update is installed.

  - `IMMEDIATE`: The update is installed immediately after being downloaded (default).
  - `ON_NEXT_RESTART`: The update is installed the next time the app is restarted (either by the user or the system).
  - `ON_NEXT_RESUME`: The update is installed the next time the app is resumed from the background.

- `mandatoryInstallMode`: Determines when mandatory updates are installed.

  - Same options as `installMode`. Usually, you'd want to use `IMMEDIATE` for mandatory updates.

- `updateDialog`: An object that configures the update confirmation dialog.

  - You can customize the title, message, button labels, and whether to display the dialog at all.

- `minimumBackgroundDuration`: The minimum number of seconds the app must be in the background before restarting to apply the update. This is useful to prevent updates from interrupting users while they are actively using the app.

**Example with Update Dialog:**

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text, Alert } from 'react-native'
import codePush from 'react-native-code-push'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Hello, CodePush!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

let codePushOptions = {
  checkFrequency: codePush.CheckFrequency.ON_APP_RESUME,
  updateDialog: {
    title: 'An update is available!',
    descriptionPrefix: "A new version of the app is available.  What's new:\n\n",
    mandatoryContinueButtonLabel: 'Update Now',
    optionalIgnoreButtonLabel: 'Later',
    optionalInstallButtonLabel: 'Install',
    mandatoryUpdateMessage: 'An update is required to continue using the app.',
    optionalUpdateMessage: 'A new version of the app is available.  Would you like to update?',
  },
  installMode: codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE,
}

export default codePush(codePushOptions)(App)
```

### 8. Releasing Updates:

Once you've made changes to your JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or image assets, you can release an update to CodePush using the CLI:

```plaintext
code-push release-react MyApp-iOS ios --description "Bug fixes and performance improvements" --mandatory false
code-push release-react MyApp-Android android --description "Bug fixes and performance improvements" --mandatory false
```

**Explanation:**

- `MyApp-iOS` and `MyApp-Android`: The names of your registered apps.
- `ios` and `android`: The platform for the update.
- `--description`: A description of the changes included in the update. This will be displayed to users (if you configure the `updateDialog` as shown above).
- `--mandatory`: Specifies whether the update is mandatory. If `true`, users will be required to install the update to continue using the app.
- `--development`: Include this flag if you're deploying a development build for testing.
- `--targetBinaryVersion`: Specifies the app version(s) the update is compatible with. For example, `--targetBinaryVersion 1.0.0` will only deploy to users running version 1.0.0 of the native app. This is crucial to ensure updates don't break older versions with incompatible native code. You can specify a semver range as well (e.g., `--targetBinaryVersion ~1.0.0` or `--targetBinaryVersion >=1.0.0 <2.0.0`).

**Example targeting a specific app version:**

```plaintext
code-push release-react MyApp-iOS ios --description "Bug fixes and performance improvements" --mandatory false --targetBinaryVersion 1.0.0
```

### Staging vs. Production Deployments

CodePush supports multiple deployments, typically staging and production. This allows you to test updates with a subset of users before rolling them out to everyone.

- **Check Deployment Status:**

  ```plaintext
  code-push deployment ls MyApp-iOS
  code-push deployment ls MyApp-Android
  ```

- **Promote from Staging to Production:**

  ```plaintext
  code-push promote MyApp-iOS Staging Production
  code-push promote MyApp-Android Staging Production
  ```

Before promoting to production, thoroughly test your updates in your staging deployment to catch any potential issues.

### Testing CodePush Updates

Before deploying updates to your users, it's crucial to test them thoroughly. Here are a few ways to test CodePush updates:

1.  **Use the Staging Deployment:** Deploy your updates to the staging deployment and install the staging build of your app on a test device or emulator.
2.  **Target Specific Users:** Use CodePush's targeting features to deploy updates to a specific group of users based on criteria like app version or device type.
3.  **A/B Testing:** Use CodePush to A/B test different versions of your app by deploying different updates to different user segments.

## Best Practices for Using CodePush

- **Keep Updates Small:** Large updates can take longer to download and install, potentially impacting the user experience. Try to keep your updates as small as possible by optimizing your code and assets.
- **Use Semantic Versioning:** Use semantic versioning (semver) for your app releases to clearly communicate the type of changes included in each update.
- **Target Specific App Versions:** Use the `--targetBinaryVersion` flag when releasing updates to ensure compatibility with specific app versions. This prevents unexpected behavior or crashes in older versions.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Always test your updates thoroughly before deploying them to production. Use staging deployments and target specific users for testing.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement error handling in your app to gracefully handle cases where an update fails to download or install.
- **Inform Users About Updates:** Use the `updateDialog` option to inform users about available updates and provide a clear explanation of the changes included. This can improve user engagement and adoption.
- **Avoid Native Code Changes:** CodePush is primarily designed for updating JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and image assets. If you need to make changes to native code, you'll still need to release a new version of your app through the app stores. Significant architecture changes or changes to native modules generally require a full app store release.
- **Rollback Updates:** If an update introduces a critical bug, you can quickly rollback to a previous version using the CodePush CLI.
- **Monitor CodePush Usage:** Use CodePush's analytics to monitor update adoption rates and identify any issues.

## Conclusion

CodePush is a powerful tool for delivering seamless updates to your React Native applications. By following the steps and best practices outlined in this guide, you can efficiently deploy bug fixes, new features, and improvements to your users without requiring them to download a new app version from the app store. This leads to a better user experience, increased engagement, and faster iteration cycles for your development team. Remember to thoroughly test your updates and target the correct app versions to ensure a smooth and reliable update process. Happy coding!
