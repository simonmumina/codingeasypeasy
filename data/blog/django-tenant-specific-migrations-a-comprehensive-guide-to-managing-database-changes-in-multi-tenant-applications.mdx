# Django Tenant-Specific Migrations: A Comprehensive Guide

Building multi-tenant applications with Django presents unique challenges, especially when it comes to managing database migrations. Each tenant might require different database schemas, data structures, or even specific data populations. Standard Django migrations aren't inherently designed for this level of isolation. This comprehensive guide explores various strategies for handling tenant-specific migrations, providing practical examples and addressing common pitfalls.

## Understanding the Multi-Tenant Migration Challenge

In a single-tenant Django application, database migrations are typically straightforward. You make changes to your models, run `python manage.py makemigrations`, and then `python manage.py migrate` to apply those changes to the database. However, in a multi-tenant environment, you need to consider:

- **Tenant Isolation:** Each tenant's data needs to be isolated from other tenants.
- **Migration Scope:** Migrations might need to apply to all tenants, specific tenants, or only new tenants.
- **Dependency Management:** Tenant-specific migrations might depend on shared or public migrations.
- **Performance:** Applying migrations to numerous tenants can be time-consuming.

## Approaches to Tenant-Specific Migrations in Django

Several approaches can be employed to address these challenges. The best choice depends on your application's architecture and requirements. Here are some of the most common strategies:

### 1. `django-tenant-schemas`

`django-tenant-schemas` is a popular and well-established Django package designed specifically for multi-tenancy using PostgreSQL schemas. It leverages PostgreSQL's schema support to provide excellent tenant isolation. This is generally considered one of the most robust and scalable approaches.

**How it Works:**

- Creates a separate schema for each tenant in the PostgreSQL database.
- Manages migrations for the `public` schema (for shared data) and individual tenant schemas.
- Provides middleware to automatically set the correct schema based on the request.

**Installation and Configuration:**

```plaintext
pip install django-tenant-schemas
```

Add `'tenant_schemas'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```plaintext
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'tenant_schemas', # must be before any of your apps
    'django.contrib.contenttypes', # must be before any of your apps
    'my_app',
    # ...
]

SHARED_APPS = (
    'tenant_schemas',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
)

TENANT_APPS = (
    'my_app',
)

INSTALLED_APPS = SHARED_APPS + TENANT_APPS

DATABASE_ROUTERS = (
    'tenant_schemas.routers.TenantSyncRouter',
)

TENANT_MODEL = "my_app.Client" # Replace with your tenant model
```

**Example Tenant Model (my_app/models.py):**

```plaintext
from django.db import models
from tenant_schemas.models import TenantMixin

class Client(TenantMixin):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    domain_url = models.CharField(unique=True, max_length=128)
    schema_name = models.CharField(unique=True, max_length=63)
    created_on = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

**Creating Migrations:**

When using `django-tenant-schemas`, migrations are handled differently:

- **`manage.py create_tenant <tenant_name>`:** Creates a new tenant schema in the database.
- **`manage.py migrate_schemas --shared`:** Applies migrations to the `public` schema (shared data).
- **`manage.py migrate_schemas --tenant`:** Applies migrations to all tenant schemas. This can be slow if you have many tenants. You can use `--tenant=<tenant_name>` to migrate a specific tenant.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Schema Design:** Carefully design your database schema to separate shared data from tenant-specific data. Public schema contains information common to all tenants (e.g., user roles, product categories). Tenant schemas contain tenant-specific data (e.g., customer data, invoices).
- **Data Seeding:** You may need to seed the public schema with initial data. Consider creating a custom management command for this purpose.
- **Performance:** Applying migrations to numerous tenants can take a long time. Consider asynchronous task queues (e.g., Celery) to handle this process in the background.

**Example: Tenant-Specific Model**

```plaintext
# my_app/models.py
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    # No foreign keys to shared models!
```

_Important:_ Notice that models residing within a tenant schema cannot contain foreign keys to the `public` schema. Relationships should be managed carefully using IDs or other mechanisms.

### 2. Row-Level Security (RLS) - PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS) allows you to define policies that restrict access to rows in a table based on the user or other criteria. This can be used to implement multi-tenancy without separate schemas. However, this approach can become complex and less performant than schema-based isolation for large multi-tenant deployments.

**How it Works:**

- Adds a `tenant_id` column to each table that should be tenant-specific.
- Creates RLS policies to filter rows based on the current tenant.
- Requires modifications to your Django models and queries to ensure the `tenant_id` is always included.

**Example Implementation:**

1.  **Add `tenant_id` Column:**

    ```plaintext
    ALTER TABLE my_app_product ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID;
    ```

2.  **Create RLS Policy:**

    ```plaintext
    CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON my_app_product
    FOR ALL
    TO CURRENT_USER
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::UUID);
    ```

3.  **Enable RLS:**

    ```plaintext
    ALTER TABLE my_app_product ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE my_app_product FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ```

4.  **Set `app.tenant_id`:** You'll need to set the `app.tenant_id` connection setting before executing queries. This is typically done using a custom database connection wrapper or middleware.

**Django Integration:**

You'll need to modify your Django models and queries to include the `tenant_id`. This might involve using custom model managers or querysets. The `current_setting('app.tenant_id')` part from the PostgreSQL policy, must be properly configured and set during each request/connection with Django.

**Advantages:**

- Potentially simpler to implement than schema-based multi-tenancy for simpler scenarios.

**Disadvantages:**

- Performance can degrade as the number of tenants and data volume increase.
- Requires careful attention to query construction to ensure RLS policies are enforced.
- More susceptible to data leakage if policies are not configured correctly.
- Limited in terms of schema-level isolation. You can't have tenant-specific fields without extra logic.

### 3. Custom Migration Management

This approach gives you the most control but also requires the most effort. You can create custom management commands to apply migrations to specific tenants. This is useful when you need fine-grained control over the migration process or when you have unique tenant-specific requirements.

**How it Works:**

- Store tenant-specific migration files in separate directories or with specific naming conventions.
- Create a custom management command to iterate through tenants and apply the relevant migrations.
- Use Django's `MigrationExecutor` to apply migrations programmatically.

**Example Implementation:**

1.  **Tenant Migration Directory:**

    Create a directory structure like this:

    ```
    migrations/
        __init__.py
        0001_initial.py (shared migration)
        tenant_a/
            __init__.py
            0001_add_tenant_specific_field.py
        tenant_b/
            __init__.py
            0001_another_tenant_specific_change.py
    ```

2.  **Custom Management Command (`management/commands/migrate_tenant.py`):**

    ```plaintext
    from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
    from django.db import connection
    from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.utils.module_loading import import_string

    class Command(BaseCommand):
        help = 'Migrates a specific tenant'

        def add_arguments(self, parser):
            parser.add_argument('tenant_name', type=str, help='The name of the tenant to migrate')

        def handle(self, *args, **options):
            tenant_name = options['tenant_name']

            try:
                # Load the tenant object (replace with your tenant model)
                TenantModel = import_string(settings.TENANT_MODEL)  # Assuming TENANT_MODEL is defined in settings.py
                tenant = TenantModel.objects.get(schema_name=tenant_name)  # Adjust lookup as needed
            except TenantModel.DoesNotExist:
                raise CommandError(f"Tenant '{tenant_name}' does not exist.")


            # Assuming you are using schema-based tenancy and want to execute against the tenant's schema
            if hasattr(connection, 'set_schema'):
                connection.set_schema(tenant_name) # for django-tenant-schemas

            executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)
            targets = executor.loader.graph.leaf_nodes()
            plan = executor.migration_plan(targets)


            self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS(f"Migrating tenant: {tenant_name}"))

            if not plan:
                self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS("No migrations to apply."))
                return

            executor.migrate(targets)

            self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS("Tenant migration completed."))

            # Reset the schema after the migration is complete
            if hasattr(connection, 'set_schema'):
                connection.set_schema_to_public()


    ```

3.  **Usage:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py migrate_tenant tenant_a
    ```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch migration failures.
- **Migration Order:** Ensure that migrations are applied in the correct order, considering dependencies.
- **Rollbacks:** Consider how to handle rollbacks in case of migration failures.
- **Transactions:** Wrap migrations in transactions to ensure data consistency.
- **Tenant Model:** Use your existing tenant model to fetch tenants. Make sure that the path to the model is declared in `settings.py`.

**Advantages:**

- **Full Control:** Maximum flexibility and control over the migration process.
- **Custom Logic:** Allows you to incorporate custom logic before, during, or after migrations.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complexity:** Requires significant development effort and maintenance.
- **Error Prone:** More susceptible to errors if not implemented carefully.

### 4. `django-tenants` (Alternative to `django-tenant-schemas`)

While `django-tenant-schemas` is a well-established solution, `django-tenants` provides another approach to multi-tenancy. It builds upon the same principles but offers some differences in implementation and features. It relies on separate schemas for each tenant as well.

**Key differences**

- **Tenant Identification:** Uses a different mechanism for identifying the active tenant. It relies on custom User models (extending `TenantMixin`) and authentication backends.
- **Signal handling:** Uses signals instead of the `TenantSyncRouter`.
- **Schema creation:** Requires extra code to setup the database connection and schema creation for tenants.

**Example (very basic setup):**

Install the package:

```plaintext
pip install django-tenants
```

Update `settings.py`

```plaintext
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django_tenants',  # Mandatory.
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    # other apps...
]

SHARED_APPS = (
    'django_tenants', # mandatory
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.sessions', # mandatory
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'tenant_app', # your tenant-specific app
)

TENANT_APPS = (
    'tenant_app', # your tenant-specific app
)

INSTALLED_APPS = SHARED_APPS + TENANT_APPS

TENANT_MODEL = "tenant_app.Client"
```

Your `TenantMixin` model in `tenant_app/models.py` would look like:

```plaintext
from django.db import models
from django_tenants.models import TenantMixin

class Client(TenantMixin):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    domain_url = models.CharField(unique=True, max_length=128)
    schema_name = models.CharField(unique=True, max_length=63)

    auto_create_schema = True  # If True, schema will be automatically created and synced when a tenant is saved.

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

The tenant-specific models also live in `tenant_app/models.py`. Migrations work similarly to `django-tenant-schemas`. Remember to run `migrate_schemas`

**Advantages:**

- Offers a different approach to tenant identification that may be more suitable for certain use cases.
- `auto_create_schema` simplifies the initial tenant setup.

**Disadvantages:**

- Smaller community compared to `django-tenant-schemas`.
- Migrations and schema management can be slightly more complex.

## Best Practices for Tenant-Specific Migrations

Regardless of the approach you choose, follow these best practices:

- **Automate:** Automate the migration process as much as possible, using scripts or management commands.
- **Test:** Thoroughly test your migrations in a development environment before applying them to production.
- **Backup:** Always back up your database before running migrations.
- **Monitor:** Monitor the migration process to ensure it completes successfully.
- **Document:** Document your migration strategy and any custom logic.
- **Version Control:** Keep your migration files in version control (e.g., Git).
- **Idempotent Migrations:** Ensure that your migrations are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing errors or data corruption. This is especially important when dealing with complex multi-tenant environments.
- **Consider Data Migration:** For complex schema changes, you may need to write data migration scripts to move or transform data.

## Conclusion

Managing tenant-specific migrations in Django requires careful planning and a well-defined strategy. Choose the approach that best suits your application's architecture and requirements, and follow the best practices outlined in this guide to ensure a smooth and reliable migration process. `django-tenant-schemas` is generally the recommended choice for schema-based multi-tenancy due to its maturity and robust features. However, other approaches like RLS or custom management commands can be viable options depending on your specific needs. Always remember to test your migrations thoroughly and automate the process as much as possible.
