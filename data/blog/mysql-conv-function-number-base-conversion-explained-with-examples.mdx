# MySQL CONV() Function: Number Base Conversion Explained with Examples

The `CONV()` function in MySQL is a powerful tool for converting numbers between different number bases. It allows you to convert a number from one base (e.g., decimal, binary, hexadecimal) to another, making it invaluable for various data manipulation and analysis tasks. This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to using the `CONV()` function, complete with practical examples.

## What is the CONV() Function?

The `CONV()` function takes three arguments:

```plaintext
CONV(number, from_base, to_base)
```

- **`number`**: The number you want to convert. This can be a number represented as a string or a numeric value.
- **`from_base`**: The base of the input number. This is an integer between 2 and 36 (inclusive).
- **`to_base`**: The base you want to convert the number to. This is also an integer between 2 and 36 (inclusive).

The function returns the converted number as a string. If any of the arguments are `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`.

## Understanding Number Bases

Before diving into examples, let's briefly recap number bases:

- **Decimal (Base-10):** The standard number system we use daily, with digits 0-9.
- **Binary (Base-2):** Uses only digits 0 and 1. Fundamental for computer systems.
- **Octal (Base-8):** Uses digits 0-7.
- **Hexadecimal (Base-16):** Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F (where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15). Commonly used for representing colors, memory addresses, etc.

## Basic Examples of CONV()

Let's start with some simple examples:

**1. Converting Decimal to Binary:**

```plaintext
SELECT CONV('10', 10, 2); -- Output: 1010
```

This query converts the decimal number 10 to its binary equivalent, which is 1010.

**2. Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal:**

```plaintext
SELECT CONV('255', 10, 16); -- Output: FF
```

This query converts the decimal number 255 to its hexadecimal equivalent, which is FF.

**3. Converting Binary to Decimal:**

```plaintext
SELECT CONV('1010', 2, 10); -- Output: 10
```

This converts the binary number 1010 to its decimal equivalent, which is 10.

**4. Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal:**

```plaintext
SELECT CONV('FF', 16, 10); -- Output: 255
```

This converts the hexadecimal number FF to its decimal equivalent, which is 255.

**5. Using with Numeric Values:**

The `CONV()` function also accepts numeric values directly, without the need to enclose them in quotes as strings.

```plaintext
SELECT CONV(10, 10, 2); -- Output: 1010
```

## Advanced Examples and Use Cases

Here are some more complex examples demonstrating the versatility of the `CONV()` function:

**1. Converting Binary to Hexadecimal:**

```plaintext
SELECT CONV('11110000', 2, 16); -- Output: F0
```

This converts the binary number 11110000 to its hexadecimal equivalent, which is F0.

**2. Converting Hexadecimal to Binary:**

Converting directly from hexadecimal to binary isn't a single step with `CONV()`. You need to first convert to decimal and then to binary. Here's how you can do it using nested `CONV()` calls:

```plaintext
SELECT CONV(CONV('FF', 16, 10), 10, 2); -- Output: 11111111
```

**Explanation:**

- The inner `CONV('FF', 16, 10)` converts the hexadecimal `FF` to decimal `255`.
- The outer `CONV(255, 10, 2)` converts the decimal `255` to binary `11111111`.

**3. Converting Between Less Common Bases:**

`CONV()` supports bases beyond the typical binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. For example, let's convert from base-3 to base-5:

```plaintext
SELECT CONV('210', 3, 5); -- Output: 14
```

This converts the number 210 in base-3 to its equivalent in base-5. In base-10, 210 (base-3) is (2 _ 3^2) + (1 _ 3^1) + (0 _ 3^0) = 18 + 3 + 0 = 21. And 21 (base-10) is 14 in base-5 (1 _ 5^1) + (4 \* 5^0) = 5 + 4 = 9. Oops! Let's try that again:

```plaintext
SELECT CONV('210', 3, 10); -- convert to decimal
SELECT CONV(18+3+0, 10, 5);  -- 18+3+0 = 21
SELECT CONV('21', 10, 5); -- much simpler.  Output: 41

```

The first query calculates the decimal value of `210` (base 3) which is 21(base 10).
The second query converts the decimal value 21 to base 5. 21 = 4\*5 + 1, so `41` is the output.

**4. Using CONV() in a WHERE Clause:**

You can use `CONV()` within a `WHERE` clause to filter data based on number base conversions. For example, let's assume you have a table named `products` with a column `product_id` stored as a hexadecimal string. You can find all products where the decimal equivalent of the `product_id` is greater than 100.

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id VARCHAR(255),
  product_name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name) VALUES
('64', 'Product A'), -- 100 in decimal
('65', 'Product B'), -- 101 in decimal
('FF', 'Product C'); -- 255 in decimal

SELECT * FROM products WHERE CONV(product_id, 16, 10) > 100;
```

This query will return 'Product B' and 'Product C' because the decimal equivalents of '65' and 'FF' (101 and 255 respectively) are greater than 100.

**5. Working with NULL Values:**

Remember that if any of the inputs to `CONV()` are `NULL`, the result will also be `NULL`.

```plaintext
SELECT CONV(NULL, 10, 2); -- Output: NULL
```

You might need to handle `NULL` values appropriately in your queries, perhaps using `COALESCE` to provide a default value.

**6. Representing Numbers Beyond 36:**

Since `CONV()` only supports bases up to 36, you might need a different approach for representing numbers beyond that. This typically involves writing a custom function or using a programming language to handle the conversion.

## Important Considerations and Limitations

- **Input Types:** While `CONV()` can handle both string and numeric inputs for the `number` argument, it's generally best practice to use strings to avoid potential type conversion issues.
- **Base Range:** The `from_base` and `to_base` arguments must be integers between 2 and 36 (inclusive). Trying to use values outside this range will result in an error.
- **String Representation:** The `CONV()` function always returns a string representation of the converted number. If you need a numeric value, you might need to explicitly cast the result to an appropriate numeric type (e.g., `INT`, `DECIMAL`).
- **Error Handling:** If the input `number` contains invalid characters for the `from_base`, the `CONV()` function will not produce an error, but might give unexpected or `NULL` values.
- **Hexadecimal Case:** The function is case-insensitive for hexadecimal values; both 'A' and 'a' will be interpreted as 10.

## Conclusion

The MySQL `CONV()` function is a valuable tool for number base conversion within your database queries. By understanding its syntax, limitations, and the principles of number bases, you can effectively use it to manipulate and analyze data in various formats. Remember to handle `NULL` values and validate your inputs to ensure accurate and reliable results. Practice with different examples to become proficient in using this function for various tasks related to base conversion.
