# Secure Your Nuxt 3 App: A Comprehensive Guide to Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers

In today's web environment, security is paramount. One of the most effective ways to protect your users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection vulnerabilities is by implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP). This guide will walk you through the process of setting up CSP headers in your Nuxt 3 application.

## What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. CSP works by allowing you to specify the sources from which the browser is permitted to load resources. Think of it as a whitelist for your website's assets. By defining this policy, you effectively block any resources loaded from unapproved sources, thus preventing attackers from injecting malicious code into your site.

## Why Use CSP in Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3, built on Vue.js, is a powerful framework for building modern web applications. However, even with a robust framework, security is a shared responsibility. Implementing CSP in your Nuxt 3 application provides several benefits:

- **Mitigates XSS attacks:** By restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources, CSP effectively blocks attackers from injecting malicious scripts into your pages.
- **Reduces the risk of data injection:** CSP can prevent the loading of unauthorized stylesheets and other assets, mitigating the risk of data injection attacks.
- **Enhances user trust:** Implementing CSP demonstrates a commitment to security, building trust with your users.
- **Improved Security Posture:** A properly configured CSP significantly improves your application's overall security posture, making it more resilient against various attacks.

## Implementing CSP in Nuxt 3: Different Approaches

There are several ways to implement CSP in your Nuxt 3 application. We will explore a few common and effective methods:

1.  **Using the `nuxt.config.ts` file (Server Middleware):** This is a convenient and widely used approach for setting CSP headers.
2.  **Using a dedicated middleware file:** For more complex configurations or scenarios where you need more control, using a dedicated middleware file is a better option.

Let's dive into each approach:

### 1. Setting CSP Headers in `nuxt.config.ts` (Server Middleware)

This is the most straightforward method. You can directly modify your `nuxt.config.ts` file to add server middleware that sets the CSP header.

```plaintext
// nuxt.config.ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt/config'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: true, // Ensure server-side rendering is enabled

  vite: {
    build: {
      sourcemap: true, // recommended for debugging CSP issues
    },
  },

  routeRules: {
    '/**': {
      headers: {
        'Content-Security-Policy': `
          default-src 'self';
          script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google-analytics.com;
          style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
          img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;
          font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
          connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com;
          object-src 'none';
          base-uri 'self';
          frame-ancestors 'none';
          form-action 'self';
        `,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ssr: true`:** Ensure server-side rendering is enabled. CSP is most effective when applied on the server-side.
- **`vite.build.sourcemap: true`:** Enable source maps during the build process. This is highly recommended for debugging CSP violations. When a CSP violation occurs, the browser console will typically point to a line in the generated JavaScript bundle. With sourcemaps enabled, you can easily map that line back to the original source code in your Nuxt 3 project, making debugging significantly easier. Remember to disable sourcemaps in production if you are concerned about exposing your source code.
- **`routeRules`**: Allows you to define rules for specific routes (or all routes using `/**`). The `headers` option lets you set HTTP headers, including the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
- **CSP Directives:** The example includes several important CSP directives:
  - **`default-src 'self'`:** This is a good starting point, allowing resources only from your own domain. It serves as a fallback for directives not explicitly specified.
  - **`script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google-analytics.com`:** This directive controls the sources from which JavaScript can be loaded. It allows scripts from the same origin (`'self'`), inline scripts (`'unsafe-inline'`), `eval()` and similar functions (`'unsafe-eval'`), and scripts from `https://www.google-analytics.com`. `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` should be used with caution and only if absolutely necessary, as they can weaken the security of your CSP.
  - **`style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com`:** This directive controls the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded. It allows styles from the same origin (`'self'`), inline styles (`'unsafe-inline'`), and styles from `https://fonts.googleapis.com`.
  - **`img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com`:** This directive controls the sources from which images can be loaded. It allows images from the same origin (`'self'`), data URIs (`data:`), and images from `https://www.google-analytics.com`. `data:` allows you to embed images directly in your HTML using base64 encoding.
  - **`font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com`:** This directive controls the sources from which fonts can be loaded. It allows fonts from the same origin (`'self'`) and fonts from `https://fonts.gstatic.com`.
  - **`connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com`:** This directive controls the URLs which the application can connect to (via XHR, WebSockets, EventSource, etc.).
  - **`object-src 'none'`:** This directive controls the sources from which `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements can be loaded. Setting it to `'none'` effectively disables these elements, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.
  - **`base-uri 'self'`:** This directive restricts the URLs that can be used in a `<base>` element.
  - **`frame-ancestors 'none'`:** This directive specifies the valid parents that may embed a page using `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>`. Setting it to `'none'` prevents your page from being embedded in a frame, mitigating clickjacking attacks.
  - **`form-action 'self'`:** This directive restricts the URLs to which forms can be submitted.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Start with a restrictive policy and loosen it gradually:** Begin with a very strict policy (e.g., `default-src 'none'`) and then add exceptions as needed. This approach helps you identify and address potential CSP violations early on.
- **Use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header for testing:** This header allows you to test your CSP without blocking resources. Violations are reported to the console, but the resources are still loaded. This is incredibly helpful for iteratively refining your policy. To use it, simply replace `Content-Security-Policy` with `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`.
- **Configure a `report-uri` or `report-to` directive:** These directives allow you to receive reports of CSP violations. This is crucial for monitoring your CSP and identifying any issues. The `report-uri` directive is deprecated and the `report-to` directive is recommended. You'll need to set up a reporting endpoint on your server to handle these reports. For example:
  ```
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-to csp-endpoint;
  Report-To: {"group": "csp-endpoint", "max_age": 10886400, "endpoints": [{"url": "https://yourdomain.com/csp-report"}]}
  ```
  This example uses the `Report-To` header to define a reporting endpoint at `https://yourdomain.com/csp-report`. You then need to implement the `/csp-report` endpoint on your server to receive and process the reports.
- **Carefully analyze console errors:** When a CSP violation occurs, the browser console will display an error message. Pay close attention to these messages to understand which resource is being blocked and why. Use source maps to identify the problematic code.

### 2. Using a Dedicated Middleware File

For more complex scenarios, using a dedicated middleware file offers greater flexibility and control.

1.  **Create a middleware file:** Create a file, for example, `middleware/csp.ts` in your Nuxt 3 project.

```plaintext
// middleware/csp.ts
import { defineEventHandler, setResponseHeader } from 'h3'

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const cspValue = `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google-analytics.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
    img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;
    font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
    connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com;
    object-src 'none';
    base-uri 'self';
    frame-ancestors 'none';
    form-action 'self';
    report-uri /csp-report;  //Deprecated but works broadly, see below
  `

  setResponseHeader(event, 'Content-Security-Policy', cspValue)
})
```

2.  **Register the middleware:** Register the middleware in your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```plaintext
// nuxt.config.ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt/config'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: true,
  vite: {
    build: {
      sourcemap: true,
    },
  },
  routeRules: {
    '/**': {},
  },
  middleware: ['csp'], // Register the middleware
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`defineEventHandler`:** This function defines a server event handler, which is executed for every request.
- **`setResponseHeader`:** This function sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header with the specified value.
- **`middleware: ['csp']`**: This tells Nuxt to apply the 'csp' middleware (the file `middleware/csp.ts`) to every route.

**Benefits of using a middleware file:**

- **More control:** You have complete control over the CSP header and can dynamically adjust it based on the request.
- **Organization:** Keeps your `nuxt.config.ts` file cleaner and more organized.
- **Reusability:** You can easily reuse the middleware in other projects.

**Handling Nonces and Hashes (For Inline Styles and Scripts)**

If you absolutely _must_ use inline styles or scripts (which is generally discouraged), you can use nonces or hashes to allow them through the CSP.

- **Nonces:** A nonce is a cryptographically random token that you generate on the server and include in both the CSP header and the inline script or style tag.

  1.  **Generate a nonce:** Generate a unique nonce for each request. You can use a library like `crypto` in Node.js.

  2.  **Set the CSP header with the nonce:**

      ```plaintext
      // middleware/csp.ts
      import { defineEventHandler, setResponseHeader } from 'h3'
      import crypto from 'crypto'

      export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
        const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')
        const cspValue = `
          default-src 'self';
          script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://www.google-analytics.com;
          style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
          img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;
          font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
          connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com;
          object-src 'none';
          base-uri 'self';
          frame-ancestors 'none';
          form-action 'self';
          report-uri /csp-report;
        `

        setResponseHeader(event, 'Content-Security-Policy', cspValue)

        // Attach the nonce to the request context so it's available in components
        event.context.nonce = nonce
      })
      ```

  3.  **Inject the nonce into your inline script/style tags:**

      ```plaintext
      <template>
        <div>
          <style nonce="YOUR_NONCE_HERE">
            body {
              background-color: lightblue;
            }
          </style>

          <script nonce="YOUR_NONCE_HERE">
            console.log("Inline script with nonce!");
          </script>
        </div>
      </template>

      <script setup>
        //Access the nonce value from the context
        const route = useRoute();
        const nonce = route.context.nonce;
      </script>
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `YOUR_NONCE_HERE` with the actual nonce value. You'll need to make sure the nonce is dynamically injected into your template. You can access the nonce from the request context using `useRoute().context.nonce`.

- **Hashes:** A hash is a cryptographic hash of the exact content of your inline script or style tag. If the content changes even slightly, the hash will be different, and the CSP will block the resource.

  1.  **Generate the hash:** Generate the SHA256 hash of your inline script or style tag. You can use a command-line tool like `openssl` or a JavaScript library. Make sure to hash the _exact_ content, including whitespace.

  2.  **Set the CSP header with the hash:**

      ```plaintext
      // nuxt.config.ts
      import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt/config'

      export default defineNuxtConfig({
        ssr: true,
        vite: {
          build: {
            sourcemap: true,
          },
        },
        routeRules: {
          '/**': {
            headers: {
              'Content-Security-Policy': `
                default-src 'self';
                script-src 'self' 'sha256-YOUR_SCRIPT_HASH_HERE' https://www.google-analytics.com;
                style-src 'self' 'sha256-YOUR_STYLE_HASH_HERE' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
                img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;
                font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
                connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com;
                object-src 'none';
                base-uri 'self';
                frame-ancestors 'none';
                form-action 'self';
              `,
            },
          },
        },
      })
      ```

      **Important:** Replace `YOUR_SCRIPT_HASH_HERE` and `YOUR_STYLE_HASH_HERE` with the actual SHA256 hash values.

**Recommendation:** Using nonces is generally preferred over hashes because it's easier to manage dynamic content. However, if your inline content is static and unlikely to change, using hashes can be a simpler solution.

## Best Practices for CSP Implementation

- **Start with `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`:** Use this header to test your CSP without breaking your site.
- **Monitor CSP reports:** Configure a `report-uri` or `report-to` directive to receive reports of CSP violations.
- **Use a strict policy:** Begin with a restrictive policy and loosen it gradually.
- **Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`:** These directives significantly weaken your CSP. Try to avoid them whenever possible. If you _must_ use them, use nonces or hashes.
- **Test thoroughly:** Test your CSP in different browsers and environments.
- **Automate the process:** Use tools and scripts to automate the generation and deployment of your CSP.
- **Keep your CSP up-to-date:** Regularly review and update your CSP to reflect changes in your application and security landscape.
- **Use a CSP linter or validator:** These tools can help you identify potential issues with your CSP configuration.
- **Consider using a CSP management tool:** These tools can simplify the process of managing and deploying your CSP.

## Debugging CSP Issues

Debugging CSP issues can be challenging, but here are some tips:

- **Use the browser console:** The browser console will display detailed error messages about CSP violations.
- **Enable source maps:** Source maps make it easier to identify the source code that is causing the violation.
- **Use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header:** This header allows you to test your CSP without breaking your site.
- **Use a CSP linter or validator:** These tools can help you identify potential issues with your CSP configuration.
- **Start with a simple policy:** Start with a very basic policy (e.g., `default-src 'self'`) and then gradually add exceptions.
- **Test incrementally:** Test your CSP after each change to identify the source of any issues.

## Conclusion

Implementing Content Security Policy is a crucial step in securing your Nuxt 3 application. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this guide, you can significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks and other code injection vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing the overall security and trust of your application.
