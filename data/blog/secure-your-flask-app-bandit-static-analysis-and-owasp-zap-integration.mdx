# Secure Your Flask App: Bandit Static Analysis & OWASP ZAP Integration

Building secure web applications is paramount in today's threat landscape. While robust coding practices are essential, automated tools can significantly enhance your application's security posture. This article explores how to integrate two powerful security tools – **Bandit** for static analysis and **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)** for dynamic vulnerability scanning – into your Flask development workflow. We'll provide practical code examples and step-by-step instructions to help you identify and mitigate potential security risks in your Flask applications.

## What is Static Analysis and Why Use Bandit?

Static analysis involves examining source code without actually executing it. This allows you to identify potential vulnerabilities, code style issues, and other problems early in the development lifecycle. Bandit is a popular open-source Python tool specifically designed for security-focused static analysis.

**Benefits of using Bandit:**

- **Early Detection:** Catches potential security flaws before deployment, reducing the risk of exploitation.
- **Automated Checks:** Automates the process of identifying common security vulnerabilities.
- **Customizable Rules:** Allows you to define custom rules tailored to your application's specific needs.
- **Easy Integration:** Integrates seamlessly into your development workflow, including CI/CD pipelines.
- **OWASP Top 10 Coverage:** Many Bandit rules are designed to detect vulnerabilities related to the OWASP Top 10.

## Setting up Bandit

First, install Bandit using pip:

```bash
pip install bandit
```

Now, let's create a simple vulnerable Flask application:

```plaintext
# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Welcome to the vulnerable app!"

@app.route('/execute')
def execute_command():
    command = request.args.get('cmd')
    # Insecure: Using subprocess.run with shell=True and user-supplied input
    result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return f"Command Output: {result.stdout}"

@app.route('/template')
def template_injection():
  name = request.args.get('name', 'World')
  template = f"<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>"
  return render_template_string(template)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This example contains two potential vulnerabilities:

- **Command Injection:** The `/execute` route allows users to pass commands directly to the system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. **THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN PRODUCTION!**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The `/template` route renders a template string directly from user input, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious code.

Now, let's run Bandit against our application:

```bash
bandit -r app.py
```

Bandit will analyze the code and report any findings:

```
[main] INFO     profile plugins: bandit.plugins.contextvars,bandit.plugins.cwe,bandit.plugins.django,bandit.plugins.jinja,bandit.plugins.json,bandit.plugins.paramiko,bandit.plugins.requests,bandit.plugins.subprocess,bandit.plugins.tempfile,bandit.plugins.urllib

app.py:13:0:B602:subprocess call with shell=True identified, security issue.
	>>      result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
app.py:18:0:B322:Possible Jinja2 templating injection.
	>>      return render_template_string(template)

--------------------------------------------------
Code scanned: app.py
Total lines of code: 24
Total files scanned: 1
Identified issues (severity/confidence):
        High: 2
        Medium: 0
        Low: 0
```

Bandit correctly identifies both the command injection and template injection vulnerabilities, highlighting the lines of code where the issues occur. The output shows the severity and confidence level for each finding.

**Addressing the Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** Never use `shell=True` with user-supplied input in `subprocess.run`. Instead, pass the command and arguments as a list:

```plaintext
# Secure version of execute_command
import shlex

@app.route('/execute_safe')
def execute_command_safe():
    command = request.args.get('cmd')
    if command:
        command_list = shlex.split(command)  # Split the command string into a list
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(command_list, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True) # check=True raises an exception for non-zero exit codes
            return f"Command Output: {result.stdout}"
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            return f"Error: {e}"
    else:
        return "No command provided."
```

Using `shlex.split()` to properly escape the command and passing the command as a list mitigates the command injection vulnerability. Also using `check=True` helps in handling exceptions gracefully.

- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** Avoid using `render_template_string` with user-controlled input. Instead, use proper templating with a well-defined data context:

```plaintext
# Secure version of template_injection
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/template_safe')
def template_injection_safe():
  name = request.args.get('name', 'World')
  return render_template('hello.html', name=name)
```

Then, create a `templates/hello.html` file:

```html
<!-- templates/hello.html -->
<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
```

By using `render_template` and passing the data as a context, you prevent attackers from injecting arbitrary template code.

Rerunning Bandit after fixing these vulnerabilities should now show fewer or no high-severity issues.

## Dynamic Vulnerability Scanning with OWASP ZAP

While static analysis is valuable, it only examines the code itself. Dynamic vulnerability scanning involves testing the running application to identify vulnerabilities. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a free, open-source web application security scanner that you can use to find security flaws.

**Benefits of using OWASP ZAP:**

- **Active and Passive Scanning:** Performs both active and passive scans to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities.
- **Automation:** Can be automated through APIs and integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Supports a wide range of web application security tests, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
- **Reporting:** Generates detailed reports with findings, recommendations, and evidence.
- **Open Source and Free:** No licensing costs.

## Setting up OWASP ZAP

1.  **Download and Install:** Download OWASP ZAP from the official website: [https://www.zaproxy.org/](https://www.zaproxy.org/) and install it.
2.  **Run ZAP:** Launch the ZAP application.

## Scanning Your Flask Application with ZAP

Here's a basic workflow for scanning your Flask application:

1.  **Access the Application:** Start your Flask application (e.g., using `python app.py`).
2.  **Configure ZAP Proxy:** Configure your browser to use ZAP as a proxy (usually `localhost` on port `8080`). This allows ZAP to intercept and analyze all traffic to and from your application.
3.  **Explore Your Application:** Manually browse through your application to allow ZAP to learn its structure and functionality.
4.  **Run a Spider Scan:** Use ZAP's spider to automatically crawl your application and discover all its URLs. In ZAP, right-click on your application in the "Sites" tab and select "Attack" -> "Spider..."
5.  **Run an Active Scan:** Once the spider has finished, run an active scan to actively test your application for vulnerabilities. Right-click on your application in the "Sites" tab and select "Attack" -> "Active Scan..."
6.  **Review the Results:** Examine the results in the "Alerts" tab. ZAP will display a list of potential vulnerabilities, their severity, and detailed information about the issue.

**Automating ZAP Scans (Example using ZAP API and Python):**

To automate ZAP scans, you can use the ZAP API. First, enable the API in ZAP (Tools -> Options -> API). Then, you can use a Python library like `zapv2` to interact with the API.

```plaintext
# zap_scan.py
from zapv2 import ZAPv2

# Configure ZAP API parameters
TARGET_URL = "http://localhost:5000/" # Replace with your Flask application's URL
ZAP_PROXY_ADDRESS = "localhost"
ZAP_PROXY_PORT = 8080
ZAP_API_KEY = None # Replace with your ZAP API key if configured

# Initialize ZAP API
zap = ZAPv2(apikey=ZAP_API_KEY, proxies={'http': f'http://{ZAP_PROXY_ADDRESS}:{ZAP_PROXY_PORT}', 'https': f'http://{ZAP_PROXY_ADDRESS}:{ZAP_PROXY_PORT}'})

# Spider the target
print(f"Spidering target {TARGET_URL}")
scan_id = zap.spider.scan(TARGET_URL)
while int(zap.spider.status(scan_id)) < 100:
    print(f"Spider progress %: {zap.spider.status(scan_id)}")
    time.sleep(5)
print(f"Spider scan completed")

# Active scan the target
print(f"Active Scanning target {TARGET_URL}")
scan_id = zap.ascan.scan(TARGET_URL)
while int(zap.ascan.status(scan_id)) < 100:
    print(f"Active Scan progress %: {zap.ascan.status(scan_id)}")
    time.sleep(5)
print(f"Active Scan completed")

# Get alerts
print("Getting alerts")
alerts = zap.core.alerts(baseurl=TARGET_URL)
for alert in alerts:
    print(f"Alert: {alert['alert']}")
    print(f"Risk: {alert['risk']}")
    print(f"Confidence: {alert['confidence']}")
    print(f"URL: {alert['url']}")
    print("-" * 20)

# Generate an HTML report (optional)
report_html = zap.core.htmlreport()
with open('zap_report.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(report_html)
print("HTML report generated: zap_report.html")
```

**Before running this script:**

1.  **Install `zapv2`:** `pip install python-owasp-zapv2`
2.  **Start ZAP:** Make sure ZAP is running.
3.  **Configure the script:** Replace `TARGET_URL` with the URL of your Flask application.
4.  **Enable API access in ZAP:** Go to Tools -> Options -> API and check "Enable API". By default, no API key is required, but it's recommended to set one in a production environment.

This script will:

- Spider your application to discover URLs.
- Perform an active scan.
- Print any alerts found.
- Generate an HTML report.

Remember to review the ZAP reports carefully and address any identified vulnerabilities. ZAP will provide recommendations and evidence to help you fix the issues.

## Integrating Bandit and ZAP into your Development Workflow

The real power comes from integrating these tools into your development pipeline. Here are some strategies:

- **Pre-Commit Hooks:** Run Bandit before committing code to prevent potentially vulnerable code from being committed. You can use tools like `pre-commit` to automate this process.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Integrate Bandit and ZAP into your CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan your application whenever changes are made. This provides continuous security monitoring. Use the ZAP API for automation within your CI/CD system.
- **Regular Scanning:** Schedule regular ZAP scans to identify new vulnerabilities that may arise as your application evolves.

**Example pre-commit configuration (.pre-commit-config.yaml):**

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
    rev: '1.7.5' # Use the latest stable release
    hooks:
      - id: bandit
        args: ['-r', '.'] # Scan all Python files in the repository
```

## Conclusion

By incorporating Bandit for static analysis and OWASP ZAP for dynamic vulnerability scanning into your Flask development workflow, you can significantly improve the security of your applications. Early detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities are crucial for protecting your users and data. Remember to regularly update these tools and adapt your security practices as new threats emerge. Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix. Good luck securing your Flask applications!
