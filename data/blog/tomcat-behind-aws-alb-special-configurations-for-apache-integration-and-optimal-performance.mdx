# Tomcat Behind AWS ALB: Special Configurations for Apache Integration and Optimal Performance

Deploying Apache Tomcat behind an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) offers numerous benefits, including improved scalability, high availability, and enhanced security. However, it also requires specific configurations to ensure everything works harmoniously and that your application behaves as expected. This blog post will guide you through the necessary configurations, focusing on Apache integration, header forwarding, sticky sessions, health checks, and performance optimizations.

## Why Use AWS ALB with Tomcat?

The AWS Application Load Balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Tomcat instances. This brings several advantages:

- **Scalability:** Easily scale your Tomcat application horizontally by adding or removing instances as needed. The ALB automatically adapts.
- **High Availability:** If one Tomcat instance fails, the ALB automatically routes traffic to healthy instances, minimizing downtime.
- **SSL Termination:** Offload SSL encryption/decryption to the ALB, reducing the load on your Tomcat servers.
- **Advanced Routing:** Route traffic based on hostnames, paths, and other request attributes.
- **Health Checks:** The ALB periodically checks the health of your Tomcat instances, ensuring traffic is only sent to healthy servers.
- **Security:** ALB integrates with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for enhanced security protection.

## The Challenge: Header Forwarding and Knowing the Client's IP

When Tomcat sits behind a proxy like the ALB, the application no longer sees the actual client IP address. Instead, it sees the ALB's IP address. This can cause problems with logging, security, and features that rely on the client IP. To solve this, the ALB forwards the client's IP address using the `X-Forwarded-For` header. We need to configure Tomcat and, in some cases, Apache to understand and use this header.

### 1. Tomcat's `RemoteIpValve`

Tomcat provides a `RemoteIpValve` to handle header forwarding. This valve extracts information from headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Port` to correctly identify the client's IP address, protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), and port.

**Configuration (server.xml):**

```xml
<Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps"
        unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true">

  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve"
         remoteIpHeader="x-forwarded-for"
         protocolHeader="x-forwarded-proto"
         protocolHeaderHttpsValue="https" />

  <!-- ... other configurations ... -->

</Host>
```

**Explanation:**

- `remoteIpHeader="x-forwarded-for"`: Specifies the header that contains the client's IP address.
- `protocolHeader="x-forwarded-proto"`: Specifies the header that indicates the protocol used by the client (HTTP or HTTPS).
- `protocolHeaderHttpsValue="https"`: Specifies the value used in the `protocolHeader` to indicate HTTPS.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Trusted Proxies:** The `RemoteIpValve` _trusts_ that the `X-Forwarded-For` header is set correctly. It's crucial to configure your ALB to _only_ send traffic to your Tomcat instances. This prevents malicious actors from spoofing the header. You can also use `internalProxies` attribute of `RemoteIpValve` to specify the IP addresses of your ALBs.

```xml
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve"
       remoteIpHeader="x-forwarded-for"
       protocolHeader="x-forwarded-proto"
       protocolHeaderHttpsValue="https"
       internalProxies="10\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}|192\.168\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}|169\.254\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}|127\.0\.0\.1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
```

This example uses a regular expression to match common private IP address ranges, as well as localhost. **Adapt this regex to match the private IP ranges used within your AWS VPC.** You can also hardcode the IP addresses of your ALBs if they are static.

### 2. Configuring Apache as a Proxy (Optional, but common):

Often, you'll place Apache HTTP Server in front of Tomcat for serving static content, handling more complex routing, or providing additional security features. When Apache acts as a proxy, you need to configure it to forward the necessary headers to Tomcat.

**Apache Configuration (httpd.conf or equivalent):**

```plaintext
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "http"  # Or "https" if using HTTPS on Apache
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "80"       # Or "443" if using HTTPS on Apache
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com

    SSLEngine On
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/certificate.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your/private.key

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"
</VirtualHost>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ProxyPreserveHost On`**: Forwards the original `Host` header from the client to Tomcat. This is crucial for applications that rely on the `Host` header for virtual hosting or other purposes.
- **`ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse`**: These directives configure Apache to proxy requests to Tomcat. The `ProxyPassReverse` directive is important for rewriting URLs in redirects to reflect the original client-facing URL.
- **`RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "http|https"`**: Sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header, indicating whether the original request to Apache was HTTP or HTTPS. **Crucially, you _must_ set this based on how Apache is configured. If the client connects to Apache via HTTPS, and Apache proxies to Tomcat on HTTP, this should be set to `https`**.
- **`RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "80|443"`**: Sets the `X-Forwarded-Port` header, indicating the port the client originally connected to Apache on. **Crucially, you _must_ set this based on how Apache is configured. If the client connects to Apache via HTTPS on port 443, this should be set to `443`**.
- **`RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For "%{REMOTE_ADDR}e"`**: While the ALB sets `X-Forwarded-For`, you may want to append Apache's `REMOTE_ADDR` to the header chain if Apache handles connections directly from clients. However, since we are discussing ALB, this is usually handled by the ALB.

**Important:** Ensure that the `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_http` modules are enabled in Apache. You may need to use `a2enmod proxy` and `a2enmod proxy_http` on Debian-based systems.

### 3. Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

Sticky sessions (also known as session affinity) ensure that all requests from a particular client are routed to the same Tomcat instance. This is important for applications that rely on session state stored locally on the server.

**ALB Configuration:**

1.  **Enable Sticky Sessions:** When configuring your ALB target group, enable "Sticky Sessions" in the "Attributes" section.
2.  **Duration-based Cookies:** The ALB uses duration-based cookies to track session affinity. You can configure the cookie name and duration. The default cookie name is `AWSALB`.

**Tomcat Configuration (Optional, but recommended for custom session management):**

If your application uses custom session management (e.g., storing session IDs in a database), you may need to configure Tomcat to use the ALB's cookie for session affinity. This ensures that Tomcat correctly associates requests with the appropriate session. You can do this by configuring the `jvmRoute` attribute on the Tomcat `<Engine>` element and ensuring the ALB's cookie name matches.

```xml
<Engine name="Catalina" defaultHost="localhost" jvmRoute="tomcat1">
   <!-- ... other configurations ... -->
</Engine>
```

You'll also need to ensure your application is able to read the `AWSALB` cookie and use it to identify the user's session. This usually involves custom code within your application to extract the cookie value and use it to retrieve the session data. For example:

```java
// Java example (in a servlet or filter):
Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();
if (cookies != null) {
    for (Cookie cookie : cookies) {
        if ("AWSALB".equals(cookie.getName())) {
            String sessionId = cookie.getValue();
            // Use sessionId to retrieve session data from your custom session store
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

However, standard Tomcat session management with ALB sticky sessions should generally work without application-level modification.

### 4. Health Checks

The ALB relies on health checks to determine which Tomcat instances are healthy and available to receive traffic. It's crucial to configure these health checks correctly to ensure that the ALB accurately reflects the health of your application.

**ALB Configuration:**

1.  **Configure Health Check Path:** In the ALB target group settings, configure the "Health check path" to a URL that indicates the health of your application. A common choice is `/health`.
2.  **HTTP Codes:** Specify the expected HTTP response codes for a healthy instance (e.g., 200).
3.  **Advanced Settings:** Adjust the health check interval, timeout, and unhealthy threshold to suit your application's needs.

**Tomcat Application (Creating a Health Check Endpoint):**

You need to create a `/health` endpoint (or whatever path you configured) in your Tomcat application that returns a 200 OK response if the application is healthy. This could be a simple servlet or a more complex endpoint that checks the status of database connections, external services, etc.

**Simple Servlet Example:**

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HealthCheckServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
        response.getWriter().println("OK");
        response.getWriter().flush();
    }
}
```

**web.xml configuration for the servlet:**

```xml
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>HealthCheckServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.example.HealthCheckServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>HealthCheckServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/health</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

### 5. Performance Optimization

- **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling for database connections to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections for each request. Configure your Tomcat data source to use a connection pool like Tomcat's JDBC pool or a third-party library like HikariCP.
- **Caching:** Implement caching to reduce the load on your database and application servers. Use a caching solution like Redis or Memcached. Tomcat also supports static content caching.
- **Compression:** Enable compression to reduce the size of HTTP responses, improving network performance. Configure Tomcat to use GZIP compression.
- **Keep-Alive:** Ensure that HTTP keep-alive is enabled to reuse existing connections, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections. Both the ALB and Tomcat support keep-alive.
- **JVM Tuning:** Optimize the JVM settings for your Tomcat instances. Adjust the heap size, garbage collection algorithm, and other parameters based on your application's needs. Use monitoring tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **ALB Idle Connection Timeout:** Configure the ALB's idle connection timeout to match your application's requirements. A longer timeout can improve performance, but it can also consume more resources.

### 6. Logging

Ensure your Tomcat logging is configured to use the correct IP address (the client's IP) obtained from the `X-Forwarded-For` header. You may need to customize your logging configuration to use the correct IP address when logging requests. The `RemoteIpValve` will ensure that `request.getRemoteAddr()` returns the correct IP address _after_ the valve processes the headers. You can then use standard logging frameworks like Log4j or SLF4j to access this value.

### 7. Security Considerations

- **Restrict Access to Tomcat:** Only allow traffic to your Tomcat instances from the ALB's security group. This prevents direct access to your Tomcat servers, enhancing security.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt traffic between the client and the ALB and, ideally, between the ALB and your Tomcat instances.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using AWS WAF to protect your application from common web exploits.
