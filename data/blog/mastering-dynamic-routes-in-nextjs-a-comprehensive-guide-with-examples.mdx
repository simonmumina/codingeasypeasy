# Mastering Dynamic Routes in Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Next.js is a powerful React framework that simplifies building performant and scalable web applications. One of its key features is **dynamic routes**, which allow you to create routes based on parameters, making your application more flexible and SEO-friendly. This comprehensive guide dives deep into dynamic routes in Next.js, providing practical examples and best practices to help you master this essential concept.

## What are Dynamic Routes?

Dynamic routes in Next.js are routes where the path segments are not fixed. Instead, they can contain parameters represented by bracketed filenames (e.g., `[id].js`, `[slug].js`). This enables you to create pages based on data fetched from a database or API, like blog posts, product pages, or user profiles.

For example, instead of creating separate files for each blog post (`/posts/post-1.js`, `/posts/post-2.js`), you can use a dynamic route like `/posts/[slug].js` where `slug` represents the unique identifier for each post.

## Setting Up Dynamic Routes

To create a dynamic route in Next.js, you need to follow these steps:

1.  **Create a directory:** Inside your `pages` directory, create a folder with the name of your dynamic route segment enclosed in square brackets. For example, for a route like `/posts/[slug]`, create a folder named `[slug]` inside the `pages/posts` directory.

2.  **Create a page file:** Inside the dynamic route directory, create a `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.ts`, or `*.tsx` file. This file will handle the rendering of the page for that specific route. Commonly, this is named `index.js` or `[slug].js`.

3.  **Fetch the parameter:** Use the `useRouter` hook from `next/router` to access the route parameters.

Here's a basic example:

```plaintext filename="pages/posts/[slug].js"
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post: {slug}</h1>
      <p>This is the content of the post with slug: {slug}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Post;
```

In this example, when you navigate to `/posts/my-first-post`, the `slug` variable will contain the value "my-first-post".

## Understanding `getStaticPaths`, `getStaticProps`, and `getServerSideProps`

Next.js provides three powerful functions to handle data fetching and pre-rendering for dynamic routes:

- **`getStaticPaths`:** Defines which paths should be pre-rendered at build time. This is **required** when using `getStaticProps` with dynamic routes.
- **`getStaticProps`:** Fetches data at build time for statically pre-rendered pages.
- **`getServerSideProps`:** Fetches data on each request for server-side rendered pages.

Let's explore each of these in detail.

### `getStaticPaths`: Defining Pre-Rendered Paths

`getStaticPaths` is used to specify which dynamic routes should be pre-rendered at build time. This is crucial for SEO and performance because it allows Next.js to generate static HTML files for these routes, resulting in faster load times.

**When to use `getStaticPaths`:**

- You have a limited and predictable set of dynamic routes.
- You want to optimize for SEO and performance by pre-rendering pages at build time.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a blog with a limited number of posts stored in a database. You can use `getStaticPaths` to generate the routes for each post:

```plaintext filename="pages/posts/[slug].js"
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  const router = useRouter();

  if (router.isFallback) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>; // Fallback content for pages not pre-rendered
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Fetch a list of posts from your database or API
  const posts = await fetchPostsFromDatabase();

  // Create an array of paths for each post
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false, // or 'blocking' or true
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch the individual post based on the slug
  const post = await fetchPostBySlug(params.slug);

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}

async function fetchPostsFromDatabase() {
  // Simulated database fetch - replace with your actual data fetching logic
  return [
    { slug: 'my-first-post', title: 'My First Post', content: 'This is the content of my first post.' },
    { slug: 'my-second-post', title: 'My Second Post', content: 'This is the content of my second post.' },
  ];
}

async function fetchPostBySlug(slug) {
  // Simulated database fetch - replace with your actual data fetching logic
  const posts = await fetchPostsFromDatabase();
  return posts.find((post) => post.slug === slug);
}

export default Post;
```

**Explanation:**

- `getStaticPaths` fetches a list of posts from a database (simulated in this example).
- It maps the posts to an array of `paths`, where each path object contains a `params` object with the `slug` parameter.
- The `fallback` property determines what happens when a user requests a route that wasn't pre-rendered at build time:
  - `fallback: false`: Returns a 404 error if the route wasn't pre-rendered.
  - `fallback: true`: Enables fallback behavior. Next.js will serve a fallback page while it generates the requested page in the background. The page will then be cached for future requests. The `router.isFallback` property allows you to display a loading state.
  - `fallback: 'blocking'`: Similar to `fallback: true`, but the user will wait for the page to be generated before seeing any content. No fallback page is displayed.

### `getStaticProps`: Fetching Data at Build Time

`getStaticProps` fetches data at build time and passes it as props to your page component. This allows you to pre-render pages with data from external sources, ensuring fast load times and improved SEO.

**When to use `getStaticProps`:**

- You need to fetch data from an external source at build time.
- The data is not user-specific and can be shared across all users.
- You want to optimize for SEO and performance by pre-rendering pages with data.

**Example:**

In the previous example, `getStaticProps` fetches the individual post based on the `slug` parameter passed from `getStaticPaths`. The fetched post data is then passed as the `post` prop to the `Post` component.

### `getServerSideProps`: Fetching Data on Each Request

`getServerSideProps` fetches data on each request and passes it as props to your page component. This is useful when you need to render pages with data that is user-specific or changes frequently.

**When to use `getServerSideProps`:**

- You need to fetch data on each request.
- The data is user-specific or changes frequently.
- You don't need to optimize for SEO as much as with `getStaticProps`.

**Example:**

```plaintext filename="pages/posts/[slug].js"
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getServerSideProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch the individual post based on the slug
  const post = await fetchPostBySlug(params.slug);

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}

async function fetchPostBySlug(slug) {
  // Simulated database fetch - replace with your actual data fetching logic
  // This function would typically make an API call.
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); //Simulate network latency
  const posts = [
    { slug: 'my-first-post', title: 'My First Post - Dynamic', content: 'This is the dynamic content of my first post.' },
    { slug: 'my-second-post', title: 'My Second Post - Dynamic', content: 'This is the dynamic content of my second post.' },
  ];
  return posts.find((post) => post.slug === slug);
}

export default Post;
```

**Explanation:**

- `getServerSideProps` fetches the individual post based on the `slug` parameter on each request.
- The fetched post data is then passed as the `post` prop to the `Post` component. Notice we _don't_ need `getStaticPaths` here.

**Important Considerations:**

- `getServerSideProps` is slower than `getStaticProps` because it fetches data on each request.
- `getServerSideProps` can be useful for personalized content or data that changes frequently.

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update statically generated pages after they have been deployed. This is a powerful feature that combines the benefits of static generation and server-side rendering.

**How ISR Works:**

- You define a `revalidate` property in `getStaticProps` to specify how often Next.js should regenerate the page in the background.
- When a user requests the page, Next.js serves the cached version.
- In the background, Next.js regenerates the page with the latest data.
- Subsequent requests will receive the updated version of the page.

**Example:**

```plaintext filename="pages/posts/[slug].js"
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Fetch a list of posts from your database or API
  const posts = await fetchPostsFromDatabase();

  // Create an array of paths for each post
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch the individual post based on the slug
  const post = await fetchPostBySlug(params.slug);

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
    revalidate: 60, // Regenerate the page every 60 seconds
  };
}

async function fetchPostsFromDatabase() {
  // Simulated database fetch - replace with your actual data fetching logic
  return [
    { slug: 'my-first-post', title: 'My First Post', content: 'This is the content of my first post.' },
    { slug: 'my-second-post', title: 'My Second Post', content: 'This is the content of my second post.' },
  ];
}

async function fetchPostBySlug(slug) {
  // Simulated database fetch - replace with your actual data fetching logic
  const posts = await fetchPostsFromDatabase();
  return posts.find((post) => post.slug === slug);
}

export default Post;
```

**Explanation:**

- The `revalidate: 60` property in `getStaticProps` tells Next.js to regenerate the page every 60 seconds.

**Benefits of ISR:**

- Improved performance compared to server-side rendering.
- Near-instant updates to content without redeploying the application.
- Reduced server load.

## Advanced Dynamic Route Techniques

### Catch-all Routes

Catch-all routes allow you to match any route that follows a specific pattern. They are defined by adding three dots (`...`) before the parameter name. For example, `pages/docs/[...slug].js` will match routes like:

- `/docs/a`
- `/docs/a/b`
- `/docs/a/b/c`

```plaintext filename="pages/docs/[...slug].js"
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Docs = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Docs</h1>
      <p>Slug: {slug ? slug.join('/') : 'No slug'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Docs;
```

In this example, `slug` will be an array containing the segments of the route. For `/docs/a/b/c`, `slug` will be `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

### Optional Catch-all Routes

Optional catch-all routes are similar to catch-all routes, but they also match the base route. They are defined by adding two square brackets around the parameter name with three dots inside (e.g., `pages/docs/[[...slug]].js`).

This route will match:

- `/docs`
- `/docs/a`
- `/docs/a/b`

### Combining Dynamic Routes with Static Routes

You can combine dynamic routes with static routes in your Next.js application. For example, you can have a static route at `/about` and a dynamic route at `/posts/[slug]`.

## Best Practices for Dynamic Routes

- **Use `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` whenever possible:** This will provide the best performance and SEO.
- **Use `getServerSideProps` only when necessary:** For data that is user-specific or changes frequently.
- **Implement fallback pages for `getStaticPaths` with `fallback: true`:** Provide a loading state while the page is being generated.
- **Consider using ISR for frequently updated content:** Balance performance and data freshness.
- **Handle errors gracefully:** Implement error handling in your data fetching functions to prevent unexpected behavior.
- **Use TypeScript for type safety:** Define types for your data and props to catch errors early.

## Conclusion

Dynamic routes are a powerful feature of Next.js that allows you to build flexible and SEO-friendly web applications. By understanding `getStaticPaths`, `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and ISR, you can create dynamic routes that are optimized for performance and data freshness. By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can master dynamic routes and build robust and scalable Next.js applications. Remember to choose the right data fetching strategy based on your specific requirements and prioritize performance and SEO whenever possible.
