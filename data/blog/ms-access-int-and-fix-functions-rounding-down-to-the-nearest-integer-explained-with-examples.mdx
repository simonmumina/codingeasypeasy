# MS Access Int() and Fix() Functions: Rounding Down to the Nearest Integer Explained with Examples

When working with numerical data in Microsoft Access, you often encounter scenarios where you need to round numbers down to the nearest integer.  MS Access provides two functions for this purpose: `Int()` and `Fix()`. While they might seem identical at first glance, a subtle difference in how they handle negative numbers makes choosing the right function crucial for accurate results. This blog post will delve into these functions, explaining their usage, highlighting their differences, and providing practical examples to help you master them.

## What are the Int() and Fix() Functions?

Both `Int()` and `Fix()` are built-in functions in MS Access that take a number as input and return the integer portion of that number.  Essentially, they truncate the decimal part, but the way they handle negative numbers is where the difference lies.

*   **Int(number):** Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number.  For positive numbers, this is straightforward truncation. For negative numbers, it returns the next lowest integer (further away from zero).

*   **Fix(number):** Returns the integer portion of the number. For both positive and negative numbers, it simply truncates the decimal part, moving *towards* zero.

## Syntax

The syntax for both functions is very simple:

```vba
Int(number)
Fix(number)
```

Where `number` is any valid numeric expression. This could be a numeric literal, a variable containing a number, or the result of a calculation.

## Understanding the Difference with Examples

The best way to understand the difference between `Int()` and `Fix()` is to look at examples with both positive and negative numbers:

**Positive Numbers:**

```vba
Debug.Print Int(3.14)  ' Output: 3
Debug.Print Fix(3.14)  ' Output: 3
Debug.Print Int(3.99)  ' Output: 3
Debug.Print Fix(3.99)  ' Output: 3
```

As you can see, for positive numbers, both `Int()` and `Fix()` return the same result â€“ they simply truncate the decimal portion.

**Negative Numbers:**

This is where the key difference becomes apparent:

```vba
Debug.Print Int(-3.14) ' Output: -4
Debug.Print Fix(-3.14) ' Output: -3
Debug.Print Int(-3.99) ' Output: -4
Debug.Print Fix(-3.99) ' Output: -3
```

Notice that:

*   `Int(-3.14)` returns -4 because -4 is the largest integer that is less than or equal to -3.14.  Think of it moving down the number line.
*   `Fix(-3.14)` returns -3 because it simply truncates the decimal part, moving towards zero.

## Practical Applications and Use Cases

Knowing when to use `Int()` or `Fix()` is crucial. Here are some common scenarios:

*   **Calculating Age:** When calculating age from a date of birth, you often need to find the whole number of years.  If you want to be conservative (i.e., only consider someone a full age when they've *completely* passed that birthday), `Int()` is suitable. If you are using the formula to determine a minimum age where age should always be rounded down, then use the `Int()` function.

    ```vba
    Dim BirthDate As Date
    Dim TodayDate As Date
    Dim Age As Integer

    BirthDate = #1/1/1990#
    TodayDate = Date() ' Today's date

    Age = Int((TodayDate - BirthDate) / 365.25)  ' Account for leap years
    Debug.Print "Age: " & Age ' Output might be 34 depending on the day of the year
    ```

*   **Working with Currency and Percentages:** When dealing with financial calculations, you might need to round down to the nearest dollar or cent. `Fix()` is often preferred in these cases because it preserves the expected direction of rounding (towards zero) for both positive and negative values. This is important to avoid unintended consequences like overestimating expenses or underestimating revenue.

    ```vba
    Dim Price As Currency
    Dim Discount As Single
    Dim FinalPrice As Currency

    Price = 125.75
    Discount = 0.10  ' 10% discount

    FinalPrice = Price - Fix(Price * Discount) ' Apply discount - truncate cents
    Debug.Print "Final Price: " & FinalPrice ' Output: 113 (assuming Fix truncates the cent after the discount calculation)
    ```

*   **Gaming and Simulations:** In game development or simulations, you might need to determine how many whole units of a resource are available or how many steps a character can take. Using `Int()` might be appropriate if you want to underestimate the available amount to avoid exceeding a limit.

*   **Inventory Management:** When calculating the number of complete items that can be shipped based on available components, `Int()` is useful to ensure you don't over-promise.

## Choosing the Right Function

Here's a simple rule of thumb:

*   **Use `Int()` when:**  You need the *largest integer less than or equal to* the number, especially when dealing with negative numbers.  This is often used when you need to round *down* in a mathematical sense.

*   **Use `Fix()` when:** You need to truncate the decimal part, effectively rounding *towards zero*, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative. This is commonly used in financial calculations or when you want consistent truncation behavior.

## Code Examples in Action

Let's look at some more complex examples in VBA:

```vba
Sub TestIntAndFix()

    Dim TestNumber As Double

    TestNumber = 7.8

    Debug.Print "Original Number: " & TestNumber
    Debug.Print "Int(Number): " & Int(TestNumber)
    Debug.Print "Fix(Number): " & Fix(TestNumber)

    TestNumber = -7.8

    Debug.Print "Original Number: " & TestNumber
    Debug.Print "Int(Number): " & Int(TestNumber)
    Debug.Print "Fix(Number): " & Fix(TestNumber)

    'Using Int() to find the whole number of months between two dates:
    Dim StartDate As Date
    Dim EndDate As Date
    Dim NumberOfMonths As Integer

    StartDate = #1/1/2023#
    EndDate = #2/29/2024# 'Leap Year!

    NumberOfMonths = Int(DateDiff("m", StartDate, EndDate))

    Debug.Print "Number of Months between " & StartDate & " and " & EndDate & ": " & NumberOfMonths ' Output: 13


    'Using Fix() to truncate a price after a discount
    Dim OriginalPrice As Currency
    Dim DiscountPercent As Single
    Dim DiscountedPrice As Currency

    OriginalPrice = 100.75
    DiscountPercent = 0.20  ' 20%

    DiscountedPrice = OriginalPrice - Fix(OriginalPrice * DiscountPercent)

    Debug.Print "Original Price: " & OriginalPrice
    Debug.Print "Discounted Price (using Fix): " & DiscountedPrice ' Output: 80.75. The Fix() function only truncates the cents of the discount which is 20.15 to become 20. The discount will be 20.00.


End Sub
```

## Conclusion

The `Int()` and `Fix()` functions are valuable tools for manipulating numerical data in MS Access. Understanding the subtle difference in their behavior, especially when dealing with negative numbers, is crucial for accurate results. By choosing the right function for the specific task at hand, you can ensure your calculations are precise and your applications behave as expected. This post has provided a solid foundation for mastering these functions and applying them effectively in your MS Access projects. Remember to experiment with different values and scenarios to solidify your understanding!
