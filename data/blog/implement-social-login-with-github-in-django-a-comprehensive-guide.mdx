# Implement Social Login with GitHub in Django: A Comprehensive Guide

Social login has become a standard feature for modern web applications, offering users a quick and convenient way to register and log in without the hassle of creating and remembering separate passwords. GitHub, being a widely used platform for developers, is a popular choice for social login integration. This guide will walk you through implementing social login with GitHub in your Django project using the powerful and flexible `django-allauth` package.

## What is Django Allauth?

`django-allauth` is a popular Django package that provides a comprehensive solution for handling user authentication, registration, account management, and social authentication. It simplifies the integration of various social login providers, including GitHub, Google, Facebook, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python:** Python 3.6 or higher is recommended.
- **Django:** Django 3.0 or higher.
- **pip:** Python's package installer.

## Step 1: Project Setup

If you haven't already, create a new Django project:

```plaintext
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or .venv/Scripts/activate on Windows
pip install django
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp accounts
```

Remember to replace `myproject` and `accounts` with your desired project and app names.

## Step 2: Install Django Allauth

Install the `django-allauth` package along with the `requests` package which is a dependency for many social providers including GitHub:

```plaintext
pip install django-allauth requests
```

## Step 3: Configure Settings.py

Add `allauth` and its required dependencies to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```plaintext
# myproject/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'accounts',  # Your accounts app
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    'allauth.socialaccount.providers.github',  # Add this for GitHub
]
```

Configure authentication backends to use `allauth`:

```plaintext
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',  # Default Django authentication
    'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',  # allauth authentication
]
```

Define the login and logout redirect URLs. These are the URLs users will be redirected to after logging in or out:

```plaintext
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'  # Redirect to the homepage after login
ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/'  # Redirect to the homepage after logout
```

Configure `allauth` specific settings:

```plaintext
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True  # Force users to provide an email address
ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = True # Force users to provide a username
ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email' # Authenticate using email
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'mandatory'  # Require email verification
SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
    'github': {
        'SCOPE': [
            'user',
            'repo',
            'read:org',
        ],
    }
}

SITE_ID = 1 # Crucial!  This tells allauth which Django Site to use. Ensure you have a Site object in the database.
```

Remember to set `SITE_ID` to 1. This tells `allauth` which `Site` object to use in your database.

## Step 4: Database Migrations

Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables for `allauth` and its dependencies:

```plaintext
python manage.py migrate
```

## Step 5: Create a GitHub OAuth App

1.  **Go to GitHub Developer Settings:** Navigate to your GitHub account settings and then go to "Developer settings". You can usually find this by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner, then "Settings", and then "Developer settings" in the left sidebar.

2.  **Create a New OAuth App:** Click on "OAuth Apps" in the left sidebar, and then click "New OAuth App".

3.  **Fill in the Required Information:**

    - **Application name:** Choose a descriptive name for your application (e.g., "My Django App").
    - **Homepage URL:** Enter the base URL of your Django application (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`).
    - **Authorization callback URL:** This is the URL that GitHub will redirect to after the user authorizes your application. It should follow the pattern `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/github/login/callback/`. Replace `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with your actual domain or development server URL.

4.  **Register the Application:** Click "Register application".

5.  **Retrieve Client ID and Secret:** After registering, you will be provided with a "Client ID" and a "Client Secret". Keep these values safe, as they are essential for connecting your Django application to GitHub.

## Step 6: Configure GitHub Social App in Django Admin

1.  **Create a Superuser:** If you haven't already, create a Django superuser:

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

2.  **Access Django Admin:** Log in to the Django admin interface by navigating to `/admin/` in your browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`).

3.  **Create a Social Application:** In the admin interface, find the "Social applications" section (under "Social Accounts"). Click "Add social application".

4.  **Fill in the Required Information:**

    - **Provider:** Select "GitHub".
    - **Name:** Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Login").
    - **Client ID:** Enter the Client ID you obtained from your GitHub OAuth App.
    - **Secret key:** Enter the Client Secret you obtained from your GitHub OAuth App.
    - **Sites:** Select the site you have created with SITE_ID of 1. If you haven't created one, you'll need to add a new site object. The domain name should be your application's domain (e.g. `127.0.0.1:8000` or your production domain). The "Display name" can be whatever you want.

5.  **Save the Social Application:** Click "Save".

## Step 7: Update urls.py

Include the `allauth` URLs in your project's `urls.py`:

```plaintext
# myproject/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),  # Include allauth URLs
    path('', include('accounts.urls')), #Include our accounts URLs
]
```

If you created an accounts app, you will need to create a URL file in it, for example, accounts/urls.py:

```plaintext
# accounts/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

And then a corresponding view, for example, accounts/views.py:

```plaintext
# accounts/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')
```

## Step 8: Create Templates

Create templates for login and logout. `allauth` provides default templates, but you'll likely want to customize them. You can find these templates in the `allauth` source code for reference. Create the following template folder structure inside your app (accounts) folder:

`accounts/templates/account/`

Create a base template where we are going to add the context processor to get the `socialaccount` context:

```plaintext
{# accounts/templates/base.html #} {% load socialaccount %} {% providers_media_js %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Django App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {% block content %} {% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>
```

Create the home template (home.html):

```plaintext
{# accounts/templates/home.html #} {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}
<h1>Welcome!</h1>

{% if user.is_authenticated %}
<p>Logged in as: {{ user.username }}</p>
<a href="{% url 'account_logout' %}">Logout</a>
{% else %}
<p>You are not logged in.</p>
<a href="{% url 'account_login' %}">Login</a> | <a href="{% url 'account_signup' %}">Signup</a> |
<a href="{% provider_login_url 'github' process='login' %}">Login with GitHub</a>
{% endif %} {% endblock %}
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Custom Templates:** You can override the default `allauth` templates by creating your own in a `templates/account/` directory within your project or app. For social login buttons, create or modify the `socialaccount/login.html` template. You'll also likely want to create your own templates for signup, login, logout, password reset, etc.
- **CSRF Protection:** Ensure all your forms have CSRF protection.

## Step 9: Test the Integration

1.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2.  **Access the Application in Your Browser:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

3.  **Click "Login with GitHub":** You should be redirected to GitHub to authorize your application.

4.  **Authorize the Application:** Grant your application access to your GitHub account.

5.  **Redirected Back to Your Application:** You should be redirected back to your Django application and logged in.

## Customizing the User Model (Optional)

If you need to store additional information about users, you can extend the default Django user model. Here's a basic example:

1.  **Create a Custom User Model:**

    ```plaintext
    # accounts/models.py

    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
    from django.db import models

    class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
        # Add custom fields here
        bio = models.TextField(blank=True)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.username
    ```

2.  **Update Settings.py:**

    ```plaintext
    # myproject/settings.py

    AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'
    ```

3.  **Update Forms (If Needed):**

    If you're using custom forms for signup or account editing, update them to include your new fields.

4.  **Migrations:** Create and apply migrations:

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Callback URL Mismatch:** Double-check that the "Authorization callback URL" in your GitHub OAuth app settings matches the URL you've configured in `settings.py` and the Social Application in the Django admin.
- **CSRF Errors:** Ensure you're using CSRF protection in your templates.
- **Email Verification Issues:** If you're using email verification, make sure you have configured email settings correctly (e.g., `EMAIL_BACKEND`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`). You can use a service like Mailtrap for testing email sending in development.
- **400 Bad Request Errors:** These often indicate issues with the client ID or secret. Double-check that you've entered these values correctly in the Django admin.
- **SITE_ID is crucial**: Double-check that the Site exists, and that the domain name is set correctly for your environment (127.0.0.1:8000 for development, your domain for production).

## Conclusion

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to implement social login with GitHub in your Django project using `django-allauth`. By following these steps, you can easily integrate GitHub authentication into your application, providing a seamless and convenient login experience for your users. Remember to consult the official `django-allauth` documentation for more advanced configurations and customization options. Good luck!
