# SQL Server UPPER() Function: Convert Strings to Uppercase (Examples & Usage)

The SQL Server `UPPER()` function is a powerful and straightforward tool for converting strings to uppercase. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the `UPPER()` function in your SQL Server queries, complete with practical examples and best practices. Whether you're a seasoned database developer or just starting with SQL, this guide will help you master the `UPPER()` function and improve your T-SQL skills.

## What is the SQL Server `UPPER()` Function?

The `UPPER()` function in SQL Server is a built-in string function that transforms all lowercase characters in a given string to uppercase. It's a crucial part of data manipulation and is often used for tasks like standardizing data, improving data readability, and performing case-insensitive comparisons.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
UPPER ( character_expression )
```

**Arguments:**

- `character_expression`: This is the string expression you want to convert to uppercase. It can be a literal string, a column name, a variable, or any other expression that evaluates to a character string.

**Return Value:**

The `UPPER()` function returns a character string that is the same as the input `character_expression`, but with all lowercase letters converted to their uppercase equivalents. Non-alphabetic characters and uppercase letters remain unchanged.

## Basic Examples of the `UPPER()` Function

Let's start with some basic examples to illustrate how the `UPPER()` function works.

**Example 1: Converting a Literal String**

```plaintext
SELECT UPPER('hello world');
-- Output: HELLO WORLD
```

This simple example demonstrates the core functionality: converting the lowercase string "hello world" to "HELLO WORLD".

**Example 2: Converting a Column Value**

Suppose you have a table named `Customers` with a column `FirstName`. You can use the `UPPER()` function to display the first names in uppercase.

```plaintext
-- Assuming you have a table named Customers with a FirstName column
SELECT FirstName, UPPER(FirstName) AS UppercaseFirstName
FROM Customers;
```

This query will return each customer's first name, along with its uppercase version, allowing you to see both the original and converted values.

**Example 3: Using `UPPER()` in a `WHERE` Clause (Case-Insensitive Comparison)**

One common use case is to perform case-insensitive searches. You can achieve this by converting both the column and the search term to uppercase.

```plaintext
-- Assuming you have a table named Products with a ProductName column
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE UPPER(ProductName) LIKE UPPER('%keyboard%');
```

This query will find all products whose name contains "keyboard", regardless of whether it's written in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. This is because both the `ProductName` column and the search term are converted to uppercase before the comparison.

## Advanced Usage and Considerations

While the `UPPER()` function is straightforward, there are a few advanced scenarios and considerations to keep in mind.

**1. Handling `NULL` Values:**

If the `character_expression` passed to the `UPPER()` function is `NULL`, the function will return `NULL`.

```plaintext
SELECT UPPER(NULL);
-- Output: NULL
```

Be mindful of this behavior when working with columns that might contain `NULL` values. You might need to use the `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` function to handle `NULL` values appropriately.

**Example:**

```plaintext
SELECT UPPER(ISNULL(FirstName, 'N/A')) AS UppercaseFirstName
FROM Customers;
```

This will convert the `FirstName` to uppercase. If `FirstName` is `NULL`, it will return 'N/A' in uppercase ('N/A').

**2. Character Sets and Collations:**

The `UPPER()` function's behavior is dependent on the collation of the database or the column being used. Collations define how character data is sorted and compared. Different collations can affect the result of the `UPPER()` function, especially when dealing with characters that have diacritics (e.g., accented characters).

**Example:**

The result of `UPPER('é')` might vary depending on the collation in use. In some collations, it might return 'E', while in others, it might return 'É'. Consider the implications for data consistency, especially when dealing with internationalized data.

**3. Performance Considerations:**

While `UPPER()` is generally efficient, using it extensively in `WHERE` clauses, particularly on large tables, can impact performance. Consider creating a computed column that stores the uppercase version of the column and indexing that computed column for faster case-insensitive searches.

**Example:**

```plaintext
-- Create a computed column for the uppercase version of ProductName
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD UppercaseProductName AS UPPER(ProductName);

-- Create an index on the computed column
CREATE INDEX IX_Products_UppercaseProductName ON Products (UppercaseProductName);

-- Use the computed column in the WHERE clause
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE UppercaseProductName LIKE UPPER('%keyboard%');
```

By creating a computed column and an index, you can improve the performance of case-insensitive queries, as the database can use the index to quickly locate the matching rows. Keep in mind that maintaining the computed column adds a small overhead during data modification.

**4. Combining with Other String Functions:**

The `UPPER()` function can be combined with other string functions to perform more complex data manipulations.

**Example:**

```plaintext
-- Extract the first three characters of a customer's first name and convert them to uppercase
SELECT UPPER(LEFT(FirstName, 3)) AS UppercaseFirstNameInitials
FROM Customers;
```

This query extracts the first three characters of the `FirstName` and converts them to uppercase, providing a concise way to generate initials.

**5. Using `UPPER()` with Variables:**

You can also use the `UPPER()` function with variables in T-SQL scripts and stored procedures.

**Example:**

```plaintext
DECLARE @ProductName VARCHAR(255) = 'laptop';

SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE UPPER(ProductName) LIKE UPPER('%' + @ProductName + '%');
```

This example declares a variable `@ProductName`, sets its value to 'laptop', and then uses the `UPPER()` function to perform a case-insensitive search using the variable's value.

## Best Practices for Using `UPPER()`

- **Use consistently:** When performing case-insensitive comparisons, consistently apply the `UPPER()` function (or `LOWER()`, depending on your preference) to both the column and the search term.
- **Consider collation:** Be aware of the collation settings of your database and columns, and how they might affect the behavior of the `UPPER()` function, especially when working with international characters.
- **Optimize performance:** If you frequently perform case-insensitive searches on large tables, consider using computed columns and indexes to improve performance.
- **Handle `NULL` values:** Always consider how the `UPPER()` function will handle `NULL` values and use functions like `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` to handle them appropriately if needed.
- **Document your code:** Clearly document your code, explaining why you are using the `UPPER()` function and how it contributes to the overall functionality of your queries.

## Conclusion

The SQL Server `UPPER()` function is a valuable tool for converting strings to uppercase. By understanding its syntax, behavior, and potential performance implications, you can effectively use it to standardize data, perform case-insensitive comparisons, and improve the overall quality of your SQL code. Remember to consider the collation settings of your database, handle `NULL` values appropriately, and optimize performance when working with large datasets. With practice and attention to detail, you can master the `UPPER()` function and confidently incorporate it into your SQL Server development workflows.
