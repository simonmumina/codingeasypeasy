## Getting Started with Emotion

### Installation

To install Emotion in your React project, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled
# or
yarn add @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

### Basic Usage with the `css` Prop

The `css` prop is the most straightforward way to style components with Emotion. You can pass a CSS string or a JavaScript object to the `css` prop, which Emotion will then inject into the component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green */
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 5px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #3e8e41;
  }
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Emotion!</h1>
      <Button>Click Me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `Button` component is styled using styled components.  Notice the use of template literals (backticks ``) and CSS syntax within the `styled.button` function.  Also, the `&:hover` pseudo-class allows us to define hover styles.

### Using Styled Components

Styled components are a powerful feature of Emotion that allows you to create reusable, styled components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
`;

const Paragraph = styled.p`
  font-size: 1.2em;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #333;
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Title>Welcome to My Website</Title>
      <Paragraph>
        This is a paragraph of text styled with Emotion.  Styled components make it easy to create reusable and maintainable styles.
      </Paragraph>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we define two styled components: `Title` and `Paragraph`. These components can then be used like regular React components, inheriting the styles defined within their respective `styled.h1` and `styled.p` functions.

### Dynamic Styles with Props

You can pass props to styled components to dynamically change their styles.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: ${props => props.primary ? '#007bff' : '#ccc'};
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: ${props => props.primary ? '#0056b3' : '#999'};
  }
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button primary>Primary Button</Button>
      <Button>Secondary Button</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, the `Button` component accepts a `primary` prop. If the `primary` prop is true, the button will have a blue background; otherwise, it will have a gray background.  We access the props within the styled component's template literal using the `props` argument.

### Theming

Emotion provides a powerful theming mechanism that allows you to define global styles and easily access them throughout your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#007bff',
    secondary: '#ccc',
  },
  fonts: {
    main: 'Arial, sans-serif',
  },
};

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: ${props => props.theme.colors.primary};
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-family: ${props => props.theme.fonts.main};

  &:hover {
    background-color: ${props => props.theme.colors.primary};
  }
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <div>
        <Button>Themed Button</Button>
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we define a `theme` object that contains global styles for colors and fonts.  We then wrap our component with the `ThemeProvider` and pass the `theme` object as a prop.  Within the `Button` styled component, we can access the theme values using `props.theme`.

### Composition

Emotion makes it easy to compose and reuse styles.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';

const baseStyles = `
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
`;

const PrimaryButton = styled.button`
  ${baseStyles}
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
  }
`;

const SecondaryButton = styled.button`
  ${baseStyles}
  background-color: #ccc;
  color: #333;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #999;
  }
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PrimaryButton>Primary Button</PrimaryButton>
      <SecondaryButton>Secondary Button</SecondaryButton>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we define a `baseStyles` string that contains common styles for buttons.  We then use the `template literal` syntax to inject these base styles into the `PrimaryButton` and `SecondaryButton` styled components.

## Advanced Techniques

###  Keyframes for Animations

Emotion seamlessly integrates with keyframes for creating complex animations.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import { keyframes } from '@emotion/react';

const rotate = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }

  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`;

const Spinner = styled.div`
  display: inline-block;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  border: 3px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-top: 3px solid #3498db;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: ${rotate} 2s linear infinite;
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Spinner />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we define a `rotate` keyframes animation that rotates the element 360 degrees. We then apply this animation to the `Spinner` styled component.

### Global Styles

Emotion allows you to define global styles that apply to the entire application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Global, css } from '@emotion/react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Global
        styles={css`
          body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
          }
        `}
      />
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we use the `Global` component to define global styles for the `body` element.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Emotion seamlessly integrates with SSR frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby.  Refer to the Emotion documentation for specific instructions on setting up SSR in your chosen framework.  The basic idea involves extracting the styles generated by Emotion on the server-side and injecting them into the HTML before sending it to the client.  This ensures that the initial page load is styled correctly and improves the user experience.

## Performance Optimization with Emotion

While Emotion is designed for performance, here are some best practices to further optimize your styling:

*   **CSS Extraction:**  Ensure that Emotion is configured to extract CSS into separate files during the build process. This allows the browser to cache the styles, improving subsequent page loads.
*   **Minimize Dynamic Styles:**  Reduce the number of dynamic styles based on props, as these can lead to more frequent style recalculations.
*   **Use Theming Effectively:**  Leverage theming to centralize your styles and reduce code duplication.
*   **Avoid Inline Styles:**  While the `css` prop offers flexibility, try to use styled components for complex styles to improve performance.
*   **Bundle Analysis:**  Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large CSS bundles and optimize your styling strategy.
