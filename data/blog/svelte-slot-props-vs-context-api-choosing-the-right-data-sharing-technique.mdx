# Svelte: Slot Props vs Context API - Choosing the Right Data Sharing Technique

Svelte offers powerful mechanisms for component communication and data sharing. Two prevalent methods are **Slot Props** and the **Context API**. Understanding their differences and appropriate use cases is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and performant Svelte applications. This post delves into each technique, exploring their strengths, weaknesses, and providing practical examples to guide your decision-making process.

## Introduction

Effective data sharing is the backbone of any interactive web application. In Svelte, components are designed to be modular and reusable. Therefore, efficient methods for passing data between parent and child components, or even between deeply nested components, are vital. While traditional props work well for direct parent-to-child communication, Slot Props and the Context API provide more flexible solutions for specific scenarios.

## Slot Props: Empowering Slots with Data

Slots in Svelte allow you to inject custom markup and logic into a component's structure.  Slot Props extend this functionality by enabling the parent component to pass data to the content rendered within the slot. This empowers the parent to influence the content of the slot, while still allowing the child component to define the overall structure.

**When to Use Slot Props:**

*   **Parent-Child Communication with Slot Customization:** When you want to give the parent component control over the content within a specific slot of the child component.
*   **Fine-Grained Control over Slot Content:** When you need to pass specific data to the slot for formatting, filtering, or other manipulations within the slot content.
*   **Clear Data Flow:**  When you want to maintain a clear and explicit data flow from parent to child, enhancing readability and maintainability.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a `List` component that renders a list of items. We want to allow the parent component to customize how each item is displayed.

```svelte
// List.svelte
<script>
  export let items;
</script>

<ul>
  {#each items as item}
    <li>
      <slot item={item} />
    </li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

In this example, the `List` component iterates through the `items` array.  For each item, it renders a `<li>` element and includes a `<slot>` element.  Notice the `item={item}` attribute on the `<slot>`. This is how we pass the `item` data as a "slot prop" to the parent component.

Now, let's use the `List` component in a parent component:

```svelte
// App.svelte
<script>
  import List from './List.svelte';

  let products = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Laptop', price: 1200 },
    { id: 2, name: 'Mouse', price: 25 },
    { id: 3, name: 'Keyboard', price: 75 }
  ];
</script>

<List items={products}>
  <svelte:fragment slot="default" let:item>
    <strong>{item.name}</strong> - ${item.price}
  </svelte:fragment>
</List>
```

In `App.svelte`, we import the `List` component and pass the `products` array as the `items` prop. We then use the `<List>` component and define the content for the default slot using the `<svelte:fragment>` element. Crucially, the `let:item` attribute allows us to access the `item` data passed from the `List` component as a slot prop. Inside the fragment, we can then use this data to render the product name and price.

**Advantages of Slot Props:**

*   **Explicit Data Flow:**  The data flow is very clear, as the parent explicitly passes data to the slot using the `item={item}` syntax.
*   **Scoped Access:** The slot prop is only accessible within the scope of the slot.
*   **Customization:**  Allows for highly customizable content injection from the parent component.

**Disadvantages of Slot Props:**

*   **Limited Scope:** Slot props are only applicable when using slots.
*   **Can Become Verbose:** If you need to pass a lot of data, the `item={item} prop2={prop2}` syntax can become verbose.
*   **Not Suitable for Deeply Nested Components:**  Primarily designed for direct parent-child relationships.

## Context API: Sharing Data Across Component Hierarchy

The Context API provides a way to share data across the entire component tree without explicitly passing props at each level. It allows you to make data available to all components within a specific context, regardless of their nesting depth. This is particularly useful for global state management, theming, or passing configuration data.

**When to Use Context API:**

*   **Sharing Data Across Multiple Levels of Components:** When you need to make data available to components that are deeply nested within the component tree without prop drilling.
*   **Global State Management:**  For managing application-wide state, such as user authentication, theme settings, or internationalization data.
*   **Configuration Data:**  For providing configuration data that affects the behavior of multiple components.
*   **Avoiding Prop Drilling:**  When passing props through multiple intermediate components just to reach a deeply nested component.

**Example:**

Let's create a simple theme context that allows us to change the background color of our application.

```svelte
// theme-context.js
import { setContext, getContext } from 'svelte';

const THEME_KEY = 'theme';

export function setTheme(theme) {
  setContext(THEME_KEY, theme);
}

export function getTheme() {
  return getContext(THEME_KEY);
}
```

In this example, we define two functions: `setTheme` and `getTheme`.  `setTheme` uses `setContext` from Svelte to set the theme value in the context, associated with the `THEME_KEY`. `getTheme` uses `getContext` to retrieve the theme value from the context.

Now, let's use the `setTheme` function in a parent component to provide the theme context:

```svelte
// App.svelte
<script>
  import { setTheme } from './theme-context.js';
  import Header from './Header.svelte';
  import Content from './Content.svelte';

  let currentTheme = 'light';

  function toggleTheme() {
    currentTheme = currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
    setTheme(currentTheme);
  }

  setTheme(currentTheme); // Initial theme setting
</script>

<button on:click={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
<Header />
<Content />

<style>
  :global(body) {
    background-color: var(--bg-color);
    color: var(--text-color);
  }
  :global(body[data-theme='light']) {
      --bg-color: white;
      --text-color: black;
  }
   :global(body[data-theme='dark']) {
      --bg-color: black;
      --text-color: white;
  }
</style>

<svelte:window on:load={() => {
    if (currentTheme === 'light') {
        document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light');
    } else {
        document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');
    }
}}/>

```

In `App.svelte`, we import the `setTheme` function and define a `currentTheme` variable. We then use the `setTheme` function to set the initial theme value and update the theme when the `toggleTheme` function is called.  The `:global(body)` styles use CSS variables to dynamically change the background and text color based on the `currentTheme`. We also set an attribute on the `body` element for the css variables to work correctly on load.

Finally, let's use the `getTheme` function in a child component to access the theme value:

```svelte
// Header.svelte
<script>
  import { getTheme } from './theme-context.js';
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  let theme;

    onMount(() => {
        theme = getTheme();
    });

  $: {
        if (theme) {
            document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
        }
  }

</script>

<h1>My Awesome Header - Current Theme: {theme}</h1>
```

```svelte
// Content.svelte
<script>
  import { getTheme } from './theme-context.js';
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  let theme;

    onMount(() => {
        theme = getTheme();
    });

  $: {
        if (theme) {
            document.body.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
        }
  }
</script>

<p>This is some content.  Current Theme: {theme}</p>
```

In `Header.svelte` and `Content.svelte`, we import the `getTheme` function and use it to access the current theme value.  We then display the theme value in the header and content. We use `onMount` to get the theme value when the component is mounted. Then we use a reactive statement `$:` to listen for changes in the `theme` and then update the `data-theme` attribute of the body element.

**Advantages of Context API:**

*   **Simplified Data Sharing:**  Avoids prop drilling by providing data to all components within a context.
*   **Global State Management:**  Suitable for managing application-wide state.
*   **Decoupled Components:**  Components don't need to know about their ancestors to access context data.

**Disadvantages of Context API:**

*   **Implicit Data Flow:**  The data flow is less explicit than with props, which can make it harder to understand where data is coming from.
*   **Potential for Overuse:** Can be tempting to overuse, leading to tightly coupled components.
*   **Debugging Challenges:**  Debugging context-related issues can be more challenging than debugging prop-related issues.

## Slot Props vs. Context API: A Summary

Here's a table summarizing the key differences between Slot Props and the Context API:

| Feature           | Slot Props                                     | Context API                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Data Flow         | Explicit (Parent to Slot)                     | Implicit (Across Component Tree)             |
| Scope             | Limited to the content of the slot           | Across all components within the context     |
| Use Cases         | Customizing slot content, parent-child data    | Global state management, avoiding prop drilling |
| Data Source       | Defined by parent component passing to slot   | Defined by context provider (ancestor component) |
| Component Coupling | Lower (slot remains somewhat independent)    | Higher (components rely on shared context)   |

## Conclusion

Choosing between Slot Props and the Context API in Svelte depends on your specific needs and the nature of the data you're sharing. Use Slot Props when you need to customize the content within a specific slot and maintain a clear, explicit data flow from parent to child. Opt for the Context API when you need to share data across multiple levels of components, manage global state, or avoid prop drilling. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each technique, you can build more robust, maintainable, and efficient Svelte applications. Remember that a good understanding of these tools is crucial for achieving optimal component communication in your Svelte projects.
