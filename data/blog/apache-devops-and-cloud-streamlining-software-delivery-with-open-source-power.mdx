**Example Jenkins Pipeline (Declarative):**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install' // Assumes a Maven project
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'ssh user@your-server "docker-compose up -d"' // Example using Docker Compose
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `agent any`:  Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available Jenkins agent.
*   `stages`:  Defines the different stages of the pipeline (Checkout, Build, Test, Deploy).
*   `steps`:  Specifies the commands to execute in each stage.
*   `git`: Checks out the source code from a Git repository.
*   `sh`: Executes shell commands (e.g., Maven build commands).

**Example `pom.xml` (Maven Project):**

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <packaging>jar</packaging>

  <name>my-app</name>
  <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>

  <properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>4.11</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <source>${maven.compiler.source}</source>
          <target>${maven.compiler.target}</target>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `<groupId>`, `<artifactId>`, `<version>`:  Define the project's unique identifier.
*   `<dependencies>`:  Lists the project's dependencies (e.g., JUnit for testing).
*   `<build>`: Configures the build process, including the use of plugins (e.g., `maven-compiler-plugin` for compiling Java code).

### 3. Apache Kafka: The Distributed Streaming Platform

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed streaming platform designed for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It's often used for event-driven architectures, log aggregation, and data ingestion into cloud data warehouses.

**Key Features:**

*   **High Throughput:**  Handles large volumes of data with low latency.
*   **Scalability:**  Horizontally scalable to accommodate increasing data volumes and processing demands.
*   **Fault Tolerance:**  Replicates data across multiple brokers, ensuring data durability and availability.
*   **Publish-Subscribe Messaging:** Enables producers to publish data to topics, and consumers to subscribe to topics and receive the data.

**Example Kafka Producer (Java):**

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.*;
import java.util.Properties;

public class KafkaProducerExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{

        String topicName = "test-topic";
        String key = "Key1";
        String value = "Value-1";

        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        props.put("key.serializer","org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

        Producer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topicName,key,value);

        producer.send(record);

        System.out.println("Message sent successfully");
        producer.close();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   Configures the Kafka producer with the bootstrap server address, key serializer, and value serializer.
*   Creates a `ProducerRecord` object with the topic name, key, and value to be sent.
*   Sends the record to the Kafka broker.

### 4. Apache Cassandra: The NoSQL Database for Scalability and Availability

[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed for handling large volumes of data across multiple data centers. It's well-suited for applications requiring high availability and fault tolerance.

**Key Features:**

*   **Decentralized Architecture:**  Eliminates single points of failure.
*   **Linear Scalability:**  Easily scales horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.
*   **Tunable Consistency:**  Provides configurable consistency levels to balance data consistency and performance.
*   **Support for Multiple Data Models:**  Supports both wide-column and key-value data models.

**Example Cassandra CQL (Cassandra Query Language):**

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_keyspace WITH REPLICATION = {
  'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
  'replication_factor': 3
};

USE my_keyspace;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  age INT
);

INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, age) VALUES (UUID(), 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 30);

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000; // Replace with actual UUID
```

**Explanation:**

*   `CREATE KEYSPACE`: Creates a keyspace (similar to a database) with a replication strategy.
*   `USE`: Specifies the keyspace to use.
*   `CREATE TABLE`: Creates a table with columns and data types.
*   `INSERT`: Inserts data into the table.
*   `SELECT`: Retrieves data from the table.

### 5. Apache Mesos and Kubernetes:  Container Orchestration

While Kubernetes is now part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the Apache Mesos project laid important groundwork for container orchestration. Both address the challenge of managing and scheduling containerized applications across a cluster of machines.  They automate deployment, scaling, and operational tasks.

**Key Features (Kubernetes):**

*   **Automated Deployment and Scaling:**  Automatically deploys and scales containerized applications based on defined policies.
*   **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:**  Provides service discovery and load balancing for applications.
*   **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts failed containers and nodes.
*   **Declarative Configuration:** Defines the desired state of the application and infrastructure, and Kubernetes works to achieve that state.

**Example Kubernetes Deployment YAML:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: your-docker-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

**Explanation:**

*   `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`: Define the Kubernetes resource (in this case, a Deployment).
*   `replicas`: Specifies the desired number of replicas (instances) of the application.
*   `selector`: Defines the labels that the deployment will use to select pods.
*   `template`: Defines the pod template, including the container image and ports.

## Integrating Apache Projects into Your DevOps Pipeline

The real power of Apache projects lies in their ability to be integrated into a comprehensive DevOps pipeline. Here's an example of how these tools can work together:

1.  **Code Changes:** Developers commit code changes to a Git repository.
2.  **Jenkins Build Trigger:**  A Jenkins pipeline is triggered automatically by the Git commit.
3.  **Maven Build:**  Jenkins uses Maven to build the application, run tests, and generate artifacts.
4.  **Containerization:** The application is packaged into a Docker container.
5.  **Image Repository:**  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
6.  **Kubernetes Deployment:**  Jenkins deploys the updated container to a Kubernetes cluster.
7.  **Kafka Data Streaming:**  Application logs and events are streamed to Kafka for real-time monitoring and analysis.
8.  **Cassandra Data Storage:**  Application data is stored in Cassandra for scalability and availability.
