# SSH into WSL: A Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up SSH Server in Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a powerful tool that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows.  This is incredibly useful for developers who want to leverage Linux tools and workflows without dual-booting or using a virtual machine.  One common need is to be able to access your WSL environment remotely via SSH. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an SSH server in WSL, enabling secure remote access to your Linux environment on Windows.

## Why Use SSH with WSL?

Before we dive in, let's consider why you might want to set up SSH in WSL:

*   **Remote Access:** Access your Linux development environment from anywhere with an internet connection.
*   **Automation:** Automate tasks and scripts within your WSL environment from remote machines.
*   **Port Forwarding:** Access services running within WSL (e.g., web servers, databases) from your Windows host or other machines.
*   **Simplified Workflow:** Streamline your development workflow by integrating WSL with your existing infrastructure.
*   **Headless Server:**  Transform your Windows machine into a headless Linux server for specific tasks.

## Prerequisites

*   **Windows 10/11:**  You'll need Windows 10 or 11 with WSL enabled.
*   **WSL Distribution:**  You should have a Linux distribution installed in WSL (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali). This guide assumes you're using Ubuntu. If you're using a different distribution, some commands may need slight adjustments.
*   **Basic Linux Knowledge:**  A basic understanding of Linux commands and concepts will be helpful.

## Step 1: Install the OpenSSH Server

The first step is to install the OpenSSH server package within your WSL distribution. Open your WSL terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

The `apt update` command updates the package lists, ensuring you have the latest information about available packages.  The `apt install openssh-server` command installs the OpenSSH server itself. You might be prompted to confirm the installation.  Type `y` and press Enter.

## Step 2: Configure the SSH Server

After installation, you'll need to configure the SSH server. The main configuration file is `sshd_config`, located in `/etc/ssh/`.

1.  **Edit the `sshd_config` file:**

    Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` to edit the configuration file.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

2.  **Modify Key Settings:**  The following are key settings to consider modifying (if needed).  It's generally a good practice to explicitly define these for better security and control:

    *   **Port:**  The default SSH port is 22.  Changing this to a non-standard port can reduce the risk of automated attacks.  If you change the port, remember to update your firewall rules and SSH client configurations.  Example: `Port 2222`
    *   **ListenAddress:** By default, SSH listens on all available interfaces.  You can restrict it to only listen on the WSL interface by specifying the IP address. This is usually not necessary in WSL's isolated environment.
    *   **PasswordAuthentication:**  By default, PasswordAuthentication may be enabled. For increased security, it is highly recommended to **disable** PasswordAuthentication and use SSH keys instead.

        ```
        PasswordAuthentication no
        ```

    *   **PermitRootLogin:** It is highly recommended to **disable** root login via SSH.

        ```
        PermitRootLogin no
        ```

    *   **AllowUsers:** Specify the users that are allowed to log in via SSH. This adds an extra layer of security by restricting access to only authorized users. Replace `<username>` with your WSL username.

        ```
        AllowUsers <username>
        ```

3.  **Save and Close:**  After making the necessary changes, save the file and exit the text editor. In `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm saving, and then Enter.

4.  **Restart the SSH Service:**  After making changes to the `sshd_config` file, you need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
    ```

    If `systemctl` fails, you can use:

    ```bash
    sudo service ssh restart
    ```

## Step 3: Generate SSH Keys (Recommended)

Using SSH keys is much more secure than password authentication.  Follow these steps to generate an SSH key pair:

1.  **Generate the Key Pair:**

    Run the following command in your WSL terminal:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
    ```

    *   `-t rsa`:  Specifies the RSA algorithm for key generation.
    *   `-b 4096`:  Specifies the key size (4096 bits is recommended for security).
    *   `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`:  Specifies the filename for the private key.
    *   `-N ""`:  Sets an empty passphrase (optional, but recommended to add a passphrase for extra security).  If you choose to use a passphrase, you'll need to enter it each time you use the key.

2.  **Copy the Public Key to `authorized_keys`:**

    This step adds your public key to the `authorized_keys` file, allowing you to authenticate without a password.

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    *   `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`: Appends the content of the public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) to the `authorized_keys` file.
    *   `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:  Sets the correct permissions for the `authorized_keys` file (read and write only for the owner).

## Step 4: Configure Windows Firewall

To allow SSH traffic to reach your WSL environment, you need to configure the Windows Firewall.

1.  **Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security:**

    Search for "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" in the Start menu and open it.

2.  **Create a New Inbound Rule:**

    *   In the left pane, click on "Inbound Rules."
    *   In the right pane, click on "New Rule..."

3.  **Rule Type:**

    *   Select "Port" and click "Next."

4.  **Protocol and Ports:**

    *   Select "TCP."
    *   Specify the port number you configured in `sshd_config` (default is 22, or the custom port you chose).
    *   Click "Next."

5.  **Action:**

    *   Select "Allow the connection" and click "Next."

6.  **Profile:**

    *   Select the network profiles that apply to your situation (typically "Domain," "Private," and "Public").  Be careful about allowing public access.
    *   Click "Next."

7.  **Name:**

    *   Give the rule a descriptive name (e.g., "SSH WSL") and click "Finish."

## Step 5:  Determine the WSL IP Address

You'll need to know the IP address assigned to your WSL instance.  This can change each time you restart WSL.

1.  **Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr`:**

    In your WSL terminal, run one of the following commands:

    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    ip addr
    ```

2.  **Find the IP Address:**

    Look for the `inet` address under the `eth0` interface (or similar).  This is the IP address you'll use to connect to your WSL instance.  It's typically in the 172.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x range.

**Important Note:** WSL 2 uses a virtualized network, which means the IP address can change. You might want to explore ways to assign a static IP address if needed, though this is generally more complex.  Alternatively, you can use a hostname instead of the IP, which may persist across restarts.  See the Troubleshooting section for more information.

## Step 6: Connect to WSL via SSH

Now that everything is configured, you can connect to your WSL instance via SSH from a remote machine.

1.  **Open a Terminal or SSH Client:**

    On the machine you want to connect *from*, open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or an SSH client like PuTTY (Windows).

2.  **Use the `ssh` Command:**

    Use the following command, replacing `<username>` with your WSL username and `<wsl_ip_address>` with the IP address you found in Step 5:

    ```bash
    ssh <username>@<wsl_ip_address>
    ```

    If you changed the SSH port, you need to specify the port using the `-p` option:

    ```bash
    ssh -p <port_number> <username>@<wsl_ip_address>
    ```

3.  **Enter Passphrase (If Applicable):**

    If you set a passphrase for your SSH key, you'll be prompted to enter it. Otherwise, you should be logged in automatically.

## Step 7: Automate SSH Server Startup

To ensure the SSH server starts automatically when WSL starts, you can add it to the systemd startup sequence.  However, WSL has some limitations with systemd, so a workaround is often necessary.

1.  **Create a Startup Script (Recommended):**

    Create a script that starts the SSH server.  For example, create a file named `start-ssh.sh` in your home directory:

    ```bash
    nano ~/start-ssh.sh
    ```

    Add the following content to the script:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo service ssh start
    ```

    Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/start-ssh.sh
    ```

2.  **Add the Script to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:**

    Edit your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file (depending on which shell you're using).  Add the following line to the end of the file:

    ```bash
    ~/start-ssh.sh
    ```

    This will execute the script every time you open a new terminal session in WSL, ensuring that the SSH server is running.  Be aware that this will prompt for your password each time a new terminal is opened, which is why key-based authentication is superior.

3.  **Alternatively, Use the Windows Task Scheduler (More Reliable):**

    This method is more complex but often more reliable for automatically starting the SSH server on WSL startup.

    *   **Create a Batch File:** Create a batch file (e.g., `wsl-ssh-startup.bat`) with the following content, replacing `<your_wsl_distribution_name>` with the actual name of your WSL distribution (e.g., "Ubuntu-22.04"):

        ```batch
        @echo off
        wsl.exe -d <your_wsl_distribution_name> -u root /usr/sbin/service ssh start
        ```

    *   **Create a Scheduled Task:** Open Task Scheduler in Windows and create a new task.
        *   **General Tab:**
            *   Name: `WSL SSH Startup`
            *   Configure for: Choose your Windows version.
            *   Run whether user is logged on or not.
            *   Check "Run with highest privileges".
        *   **Triggers Tab:**
            *   New -> At startup.
        *   **Actions Tab:**
            *   New -> Start a program.
            *   Program/script: `cmd.exe`
            *   Add arguments: `/c "C:\path\to\wsl-ssh-startup.bat"` (replace with the actual path to your batch file).
        *   **Conditions Tab:**
            *   Uncheck "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power".
        *   **Settings Tab:**
            *   Check "Allow task to be run on demand".

This method uses the `wsl.exe` command to execute the SSH start command within your WSL distribution, ensuring that it starts even when you're not logged in to Windows.  It requires running as root, which is why `-u root` is included.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Connection Refused:**  This usually means the SSH server isn't running or the firewall is blocking the connection.  Double-check that the SSH service is running in WSL (`sudo service ssh status`) and that your Windows Firewall rule is correctly configured.

*   **Permission Denied (Public Key):**  This indicates a problem with your SSH key configuration.  Verify that the permissions on the `~/.ssh` directory and the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file are correct (700 for the directory, 600 for the file).  Also, make sure you've copied the correct public key to the `authorized_keys` file.

*   **Changing WSL IP Address:** As mentioned, the IP address of your WSL instance can change. Here are some potential solutions:

    *   **Hostname:** Try using the hostname of your WSL instance instead of the IP address.  You can find the hostname in your `/etc/hostname` file.  However, hostname resolution across WSL and Windows can be tricky.

    *   **Fixed IP (Advanced):**  You can attempt to configure a static IP address within your WSL distribution. This involves modifying network configuration files, which can be complex and is beyond the scope of this guide.

    *   **Port Forwarding (Advanced):**  Set up port forwarding in your router to forward traffic from a specific public IP address and port to your Windows host, and then configure a reverse proxy to forward traffic from Windows to WSL.

*   **`systemctl` Errors:** WSL2 has limited systemd support.  Using `sudo service ssh start` is often more reliable.

*   **Firewall Issues:** Ensure the firewall rule is enabled for the correct network profiles (Domain, Private, Public).  If you're connecting from a different network (e.g., a public Wi-Fi network), you may need to adjust the rule accordingly.

*   **PuTTY Authentication:**  If you're using PuTTY on Windows, you'll need to convert your OpenSSH key to the PuTTY format using PuTTYgen.  Load your private key (`id_rsa`) in PuTTYgen and save it as a `.ppk` file. Then, configure PuTTY to use this key for authentication.

## Security Considerations

*   **Disable Password Authentication:** As emphasized throughout the guide, disabling password authentication and using SSH keys is crucial for security.

*   **Use a Strong Passphrase:** If you choose to use a passphrase for your SSH key, make sure it's a strong and unique one.

*   **Keep Your System Updated:** Regularly update your WSL distribution and Windows to patch security vulnerabilities.

*   **Monitor SSH Logs:** Monitor the SSH logs (`/var/log/auth.log` in Ubuntu) for any suspicious activity.

*   **Consider a VPN:** If you're accessing your WSL environment from a public network, consider using a VPN to encrypt your traffic.

*   **Limit Access:**  Use `AllowUsers` in `sshd_config` to restrict SSH access to only authorized users.

## Conclusion

Setting up SSH in WSL allows you to seamlessly access your Linux development environment from anywhere. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can configure an SSH server in WSL, secure it with SSH keys, and access it remotely. Remember to prioritize security by disabling password authentication and keeping your system updated.
