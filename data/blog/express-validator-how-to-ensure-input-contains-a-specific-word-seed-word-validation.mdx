# Express-Validator: How to Ensure Input Contains a Specific Word (Seed Word Validation)

Data validation is a crucial aspect of any web application.  It helps ensure that the data received from users is in the expected format and contains the necessary information. In this blog post, we'll delve into how to use Express-Validator, a powerful middleware for Express.js, to validate that an input field contains a specific word (often referred to as a "seed word").  This technique is particularly useful for scenarios like ensuring a product description contains a brand name, a comment includes a relevant keyword, or any situation where the presence of a particular term is mandatory.

## What is Express-Validator?

Express-Validator is a set of middleware functions that wrap validator.js and sanitizer.js functionalities. It provides an easy and expressive way to validate and sanitize request data in your Express.js applications.  It simplifies the process of writing validation rules and provides clear error messages when validation fails.

## Why Seed Word Validation?

Seed word validation helps maintain data quality and enforce specific content requirements.  Here are some common use cases:

*   **Content Moderation:** Ensure comments or reviews contain specific keywords related to a product or topic.
*   **Brand Enforcement:** Verify product descriptions include the brand name.
*   **Input Restrictions:**  Require users to include a specific trigger word for certain actions.
*   **Avoiding Unrelated Content:** Help filter out content that isn't relevant to a particular context.

## Setting Up Express-Validator

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.  If not, you can download them from the official Node.js website.

1.  **Create a new Node.js project (if you don't already have one):**

    ```bash
    mkdir express-validator-seed-word
    cd express-validator-seed-word
    npm init -y
    ```

2.  **Install Express and Express-Validator:**

    ```bash
    npm install express express-validator
    ```

3.  **Create a server file (e.g., `server.js`) and require the necessary modules:**

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false })); // For parsing form data
    app.use(express.json()); // For parsing JSON data

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```

## Implementing Seed Word Validation

Now, let's implement the seed word validation using Express-Validator. We'll create a route that accepts a product description and validates whether it contains the seed word "AwesomeBrand".

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false })); // For parsing form data
app.use(express.json()); // For parsing JSON data

app.post('/product', [
    body('description')
        .notEmpty()
        .withMessage('Description is required.')
        .custom((value, { req }) => {
            const seedWord = 'AwesomeBrand';
            if (!value.toLowerCase().includes(seedWord.toLowerCase())) {
                throw new Error(`Description must contain the word "${seedWord}".`);
            }
            return true;
        }),
], (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }

    res.json({ message: 'Product description validated successfully!' });
});


app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`app.post('/product', ...)`:** Defines a POST route for `/product`.
*   **`body('description')`:** Targets the `description` field in the request body.
*   **`.notEmpty().withMessage('Description is required.')`:** Ensures the description field is not empty.  If it is, it returns the error message "Description is required."
*   **`.custom((value, { req }) => { ... })`:**  This is where the seed word validation happens. The `custom` validator allows you to define your own validation logic.
    *   `value`:  The value of the `description` field.
    *   `{ req }`:  An object containing the request object, allowing you to access other parts of the request, if needed.
    *   **`const seedWord = 'AwesomeBrand';`:**  Defines the seed word we want to check for.
    *   **`if (!value.toLowerCase().includes(seedWord.toLowerCase())) { ... }`:**  This is the core logic. It converts both the input value and the seed word to lowercase using `.toLowerCase()` to perform a case-insensitive check.  If the input value *does not* contain the seed word using `.includes()`, it throws an error with a custom message.
    *   **`throw new Error(\`Description must contain the word "${seedWord}".\`);`:** This throws an error with a specific message explaining that the description must contain the seed word.  The backticks (`) allow for template literals, embedding the seed word in the message.
    *   **`return true;`:** If the validation passes (the seed word *is* found), you **must** return `true` from the custom validator.
*   **`(req, res) => { ... })`:** This is the route handler.
*   **`const errors = validationResult(req);`:** Retrieves the validation results from the request.
*   **`if (!errors.isEmpty()) { ... }`:**  Checks if there are any validation errors. If so, it returns a 400 Bad Request error with the error messages.
*   **`res.json({ message: 'Product description validated successfully!' });`:** If validation passes, it returns a success message.

## Testing the Endpoint

You can test this endpoint using tools like `curl`, Postman, or Insomnia.  Here's an example using `curl`:

**Success:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"description": "This product is from AwesomeBrand and is amazing!"}' http://localhost:3000/product
```

**Failure (missing seed word):**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"description": "This product is amazing!"}' http://localhost:3000/product
```

The successful request will return a JSON response like:

```json
{
  "message": "Product description validated successfully!"
}
```

The failed request will return a JSON response with an error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "msg": "Description must contain the word \"AwesomeBrand\".",
      "param": "description",
      "location": "body"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Customizing the Validation

*   **Case Sensitivity:**  If you need a case-sensitive validation, remove the `.toLowerCase()` calls.
*   **Multiple Seed Words:** You can modify the custom validator to check for multiple seed words by using an array and iterating through it.
*   **Regular Expressions:** For more complex pattern matching, you can use regular expressions instead of `.includes()`.
*   **Dynamic Seed Words:**  You can retrieve the seed word from a configuration file, environment variable, or even from another part of the request, making the validation more flexible.

##  Example: Checking for Multiple Seed Words

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false })); // For parsing form data
app.use(express.json()); // For parsing JSON data

app.post('/product', [
    body('description')
        .notEmpty()
        .withMessage('Description is required.')
        .custom((value, { req }) => {
            const seedWords = ['AwesomeBrand', 'IncredibleCo'];
            const containsAnySeedWord = seedWords.some(seedWord =>
                value.toLowerCase().includes(seedWord.toLowerCase())
            );

            if (!containsAnySeedWord) {
                throw new Error(`Description must contain at least one of the following words: ${seedWords.join(', ')}.`);
            }
            return true;
        }),
], (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }

    res.json({ message: 'Product description validated successfully!' });
});


app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this example:

*   `seedWords` is an array containing the seed words to check for.
*   `seedWords.some(...)` checks if at least one of the seed words is present in the description.
*   The error message is updated to indicate that the description must contain at least one of the listed seed words.
