# Using USB Devices in WSL: A Comprehensive Guide (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has revolutionized the development workflow for many. It provides a seamless way to run Linux environments directly on Windows, eliminating the need for virtual machines in many cases. However, one area that can be tricky is accessing USB devices from within your WSL distribution. This guide will walk you through the process of enabling USB access in WSL, troubleshoot common issues, and provide practical examples.

## Why Use USB Devices in WSL?

There are numerous reasons why you might want to access USB devices from your WSL environment:

- **Hardware Development:** Interacting with embedded systems, microcontrollers (like Arduino, ESP32), and other hardware requires direct USB communication.
- **Security Testing:** Tools for security auditing and penetration testing often rely on USB devices for packet sniffing and other tasks.
- **Data Acquisition:** Connecting data loggers, scientific instruments, or specialized sensors to collect data within a Linux environment.
- **Legacy Hardware Support:** Utilizing older hardware with Linux drivers when Windows drivers are unavailable or insufficient.
- **Accessing Specialized Peripherals:** Using USB-based graphics tablets, 3D printers, or other peripherals that benefit from a Linux environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Windows 10 Version 2004 or later (Build 19041 or higher) / Windows 11:** WSL USB passthrough support has significantly improved in these versions. You can check your Windows version by pressing `Win + R`, typing `winver`, and pressing Enter.
- **WSL2:** WSL1 does not fully support USB device passthrough. You need to be using WSL2. You can check your WSL version by running `wsl --list --verbose` in PowerShell or Command Prompt. If you are using WSL1, you need to convert to WSL2.
- **Basic Linux Knowledge:** Familiarity with the Linux command line is helpful for installing drivers and managing USB devices.

## Step 1: Install `usbipd-win`

`usbipd-win` is a crucial component that allows you to expose USB devices on your Windows host to your WSL2 distribution. It's a Windows service and command-line tool that acts as a bridge between Windows and WSL.

1.  **Download and Install:** Download the latest `usbipd-win` release from the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases). Choose the installer (`.msi`) file.
2.  **Run the Installer:** Execute the downloaded installer. During installation, ensure you select the option to install as a service and add the tool to your system's PATH. This will allow you to use the `usbipd` command from anywhere in the command line.
3.  **Restart Your Computer:** A restart is often required for the `usbipd-win` service to function correctly.

## Step 2: Convert to WSL 2 (If Necessary)

If you're still running WSL1, you need to convert your distribution to WSL2.

1.  **Check your WSL Version:** Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

    ```plaintext
    wsl --list --verbose
    ```

    This will list your installed distributions and their WSL versions.

2.  **Convert to WSL2:** If your distribution is using WSL1, use the following command (replace `<distro_name>` with the name of your distribution):

    ```plaintext
    wsl --set-version <distro_name> 2
    ```

    This process can take some time, especially for larger distributions.

3.  **Set WSL2 as Default:** It's a good practice to set WSL2 as the default version:

    ```plaintext
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```

## Step 3: Attach a USB Device to WSL

Now that you have `usbipd-win` installed and are running WSL2, you can connect a USB device.

1.  **List Available USB Devices:** Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

    ```plaintext
    usbipd wsl list
    ```

    This command will display a list of all connected USB devices, along with their bus IDs. Note down the bus ID of the device you want to attach. The output will look something like this:

    ```
    BusId VendorId ProductId Description
    ------ -------- --------- -----------
    1-15   045e     07a5      Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600
    2-2    0bda     0129      Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader
    ```

2.  **Attach the USB Device:** Using the bus ID you noted, attach the device to your WSL distribution:

    ```plaintext
    usbipd wsl attach --busid <bus_id>
    ```

    Replace `<bus_id>` with the actual bus ID of your USB device. For example:

    ```plaintext
    usbipd wsl attach --busid 1-15
    ```

    This command will attach the USB device to your default WSL distribution. If you want to attach it to a specific distribution, use the `--distribution` flag:

    ```plaintext
    usbipd wsl attach --busid <bus_id> --distribution <distro_name>
    ```

    Replace `<distro_name>` with the name of your WSL distribution.

3.  **Verify the Device in WSL:** Open your WSL terminal and use the `lsusb` command to verify that the device is visible. If you don't have `lsusb` installed, you can install it with:

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install usbutils
    ```

    After installing `usbutils`, run `lsusb`. You should see your attached USB device listed.

    ```plaintext
    lsusb
    ```

    The output should include a line representing your USB device. For example:

    ```
    Bus 001 Device 005: ID 045e:07a5 Microsoft Corp. Wired Keyboard 600
    ```

## Step 4: Install Drivers (If Necessary)

Depending on the device and your WSL distribution, you might need to install drivers for the USB device to function correctly. This is the same process as installing drivers on a regular Linux system.

1.  **Identify Required Drivers:** Research the drivers required for your specific USB device on Linux. The manufacturer's website or online forums are good resources.
2.  **Install Drivers:** Use your distribution's package manager to install the necessary drivers. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian:

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install <driver_package_name>
    ```

    Replace `<driver_package_name>` with the actual name of the driver package. For example, if you were using an Arduino you might need to install `arduino` or `arduino-core`.

3.  **Verify Driver Installation:** After installing the drivers, check if the device is working as expected. This might involve running device-specific commands or using graphical tools.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

- **Device Not Listed by `usbipd wsl list`:**
  - **Check USB Connection:** Ensure the USB device is properly connected to your computer.
  - **Driver Conflicts on Windows:** Sometimes, Windows drivers can interfere with `usbipd-win`. Try disabling or uninstalling the Windows drivers for the device temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.
  - **Restart `usbipd-win` Service:** Open the Services app (search for "Services" in the Windows search bar), find the "USBIP Service," and restart it.
- **`usbipd wsl attach` Fails:**
  - **Run PowerShell as Administrator:** Make sure you're running PowerShell with administrator privileges.
  - **Incorrect Bus ID:** Double-check that you're using the correct bus ID for the device.
  - **Firewall Issues:** Ensure your firewall isn't blocking communication between Windows and WSL on the ports used by `usbipd-win`.
- **Device Not Listed by `lsusb` in WSL:**
  - **Incorrect Driver Installation:** Verify that the necessary drivers are installed correctly in your WSL distribution.
  - **Device Not Properly Attached:** Double-check that the device is properly attached using the `usbipd wsl attach` command.
  - **WSL Needs Restart:** Sometimes, restarting your WSL distribution can resolve connectivity issues. You can restart a specific distribution with `wsl --terminate <distro_name>` or restart all WSL instances with `wsl --shutdown`.
- **Permissions Issues:** If you are having trouble accessing a device that shows up in `lsusb` because of permissions issues, you may need to adjust the udev rules within your WSL distro. This is outside the scope of this basic tutorial but a quick search for "udev rules usb linux" will provide guidance.

## Detaching a USB Device

When you're finished using the USB device, you should detach it from your WSL distribution:

```plaintext
usbipd wsl detach --busid <bus_id>
```

Replace `<bus_id>` with the bus ID of the device you want to detach. This releases the device back to Windows. Omitting the `--busid` flag will detach all devices that are currently attached.

## Example: Connecting an Arduino to WSL

Let's walk through a practical example of connecting an Arduino board to WSL.

1.  **Connect the Arduino:** Plug your Arduino board into your computer's USB port.
2.  **List USB Devices:** Run `usbipd wsl list` in PowerShell to find the Arduino's bus ID.
3.  **Attach the Arduino:** Run `usbipd wsl attach --busid <arduino_bus_id>`.
4.  **Open WSL:** Open your WSL terminal.
5.  **Install Arduino IDE (Optional):** If you want to use the Arduino IDE within WSL, download and install it.
6.  **Install `arduino-cli` (Recommended):** A lightweight command-line tool for Arduino development:

    ```plaintext
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Add it to your path:

    ```plaintext
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.arduino15/arduino-cli"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

7.  **List Serial Ports:** Use `arduino-cli board list` to identify the serial port associated with your Arduino. It will usually be something like `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
8.  **Upload Sketch:** Use `arduino-cli upload --port <serial_port> --fqbn arduino:avr:uno <sketch_file.ino>` to upload your Arduino sketch. Replace `<serial_port>` with the identified serial port and `<sketch_file.ino>` with the path to your Arduino sketch file.
