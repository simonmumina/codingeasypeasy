# Mastering TypeScript Composables: Type-Safe Reusable Logic in Your React Apps

Composables, inspired by Vue.js, have become increasingly popular in the React ecosystem for extracting and reusing logic across components. They offer a way to encapsulate complex behaviors into manageable, testable units, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. When combined with TypeScript, composables become even more powerful, providing enhanced type safety and developer experience. This guide will walk you through the process of typing composables in TypeScript, ensuring your reusable logic is robust and error-free.

## What are Composables?

At their core, composables are functions that encapsulate a specific piece of logic and return a value that can be used within a React component. Think of them as custom hooks, but with a slightly broader scope. While hooks are tightly integrated with the React component lifecycle, composables can be more general-purpose and used in various contexts.

Here's a simple example of a composable (without TypeScript) that tracks the window size:

```plaintext
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useWindowSize() {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleResize() {
      setWindowSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      });
    }

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    handleResize(); // Initial size

    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return windowSize;
}

export default useWindowSize;
```

This composable can then be used in any component:

```plaintext
import React from 'react';
import useWindowSize from './useWindowSize';

function MyComponent() {
  const windowSize = useWindowSize();

  return (
    <div>
      Window Width: {windowSize.width}
      <br />
      Window Height: {windowSize.height}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Why Use TypeScript with Composables?

TypeScript adds a layer of static typing to JavaScript, which offers several benefits when working with composables:

- **Early Error Detection:** TypeScript can catch type-related errors during development, preventing runtime surprises.
- **Improved Code Readability:** Type annotations make it easier to understand the purpose and expected input/output of a composable.
- **Enhanced Code Maintainability:** Refactoring becomes safer and easier as TypeScript can identify potential type conflicts.
- **Better Autocompletion and IDE Support:** IDEs leverage TypeScript's type information to provide more accurate autocompletion and suggestions.

## Typing Composables in TypeScript: Step-by-Step Guide

Now, let's dive into how to type composables effectively using TypeScript. We'll start with basic examples and gradually move towards more complex scenarios.

### 1. Defining Input and Output Types

The first step is to define the types for both the input parameters (if any) and the return value of your composable. This is crucial for ensuring type safety and clarity.

Let's revisit the `useWindowSize` example and add TypeScript types:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

interface WindowSize {
  width: number
  height: number
}

function useWindowSize(): WindowSize {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState<WindowSize>({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleResize() {
      setWindowSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      })
    }

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize)
    handleResize() // Initial size

    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize)
  }, [])

  return windowSize
}

export default useWindowSize
```

**Explanation:**

- We defined an interface `WindowSize` to represent the structure of the `windowSize` object.
- We added a type annotation `(): WindowSize` to the `useWindowSize` function, specifying that it returns a `WindowSize` object.
- We used the generic type `useState<WindowSize>` to ensure that the initial state and subsequent state updates conform to the `WindowSize` interface.

### 2. Handling Input Parameters with Types

Many composables accept input parameters to configure their behavior. It's essential to properly type these parameters.

Consider a composable that fetches data from an API:

```typescript
interface ApiResponse {
  id: number
  name: string
  description: string
}

interface UseFetchOptions {
  initialData?: ApiResponse[]
}

function useFetchData(
  url: string,
  options?: UseFetchOptions
): {
  data: ApiResponse[] | undefined
  isLoading: boolean
  error: string | null
} {
  const [data, setData] = useState<ApiResponse[] | undefined>(options?.initialData)
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(url)
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)
        }
        const json = (await response.json()) as ApiResponse[] // Assert type here
        setData(json)
      } catch (e: any) {
        setError(e.message)
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false)
      }
    }

    fetchData()
  }, [url])

  return { data, isLoading, error }
}

export default useFetchData
```

**Explanation:**

- We define an interface `ApiResponse` to represent the structure of the data returned from the API.
- We define an interface `UseFetchOptions` to specify optional configuration for the `useFetchData` composable. In this case, it allows for providing `initialData`.
- The `url` parameter is typed as a `string`.
- The `options` parameter is typed as `UseFetchOptions | undefined`, allowing for optional configuration.
- We explicitly type the return value, providing a clear understanding of what the composable returns and its structure. We also use a union type `ApiResponse[] | undefined` to indicate that the `data` might be undefined during the initial loading state.
- We use `as ApiResponse[]` to assert the type of the json response after parsing. This is important because `response.json()` returns a `Promise<any>` and TypeScript needs explicit information about the type of the returned data. This is particularly useful when your API doesn't return strongly typed data.

### 3. Using Generic Types for Flexibility

Generic types allow you to create composables that can work with different data types without sacrificing type safety. This is particularly useful when dealing with data transformations or reusable logic that should be adaptable to various contexts.

Consider a composable that filters an array of items:

```typescript
function useFilter<T>(items: T[], filterFunction: (item: T) => boolean): T[] {
  const [filteredItems, setFilteredItems] = useState<T[]>(items)

  useEffect(() => {
    setFilteredItems(items.filter(filterFunction))
  }, [items, filterFunction])

  return filteredItems
}

export default useFilter
```

**Explanation:**

- We use the generic type parameter `<T>` to represent the type of the items in the array.
- The `items` parameter is typed as `T[]`, indicating an array of type `T`.
- The `filterFunction` parameter is typed as `(item: T) => boolean`, ensuring that it accepts an item of type `T` and returns a boolean value.
- The return value is typed as `T[]`, indicating an array of type `T`.

You can now use this composable with different types of data:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import useFilter from './useFilter';

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function MyComponent() {
  const users: User[] = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
    { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', age: 35 },
  ];

  const filteredUsers = useFilter<User>(users, (user) => user.age > 30);

  return (
    <ul>
      {filteredUsers.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### 4. Handling Complex State Updates

When composables manage complex state, it's important to ensure that state updates are type-safe and predictable. You can use functional updates with `useState` to achieve this.

Consider a composable that manages a counter with increment and decrement functions:

```typescript
interface CounterState {
  count: number
}

function useCounter(initialCount: number = 0): {
  count: number
  increment: () => void
  decrement: () => void
} {
  const [state, setState] = useState<CounterState>({ count: initialCount })

  const increment = () => {
    setState((prevState) => ({ ...prevState, count: prevState.count + 1 }))
  }

  const decrement = () => {
    setState((prevState) => ({ ...prevState, count: prevState.count - 1 }))
  }

  return {
    count: state.count,
    increment,
    decrement,
  }
}

export default useCounter
```

**Explanation:**

- We define an interface `CounterState` to represent the structure of the counter state.
- We use a functional update within `setState` (e.g., `setState((prevState) => ...)`). This ensures that the state update is based on the previous state, preventing potential race conditions. We are also spreading the `prevState` object to preserve any other properties that might be present in the state (although in this simple example, it's not strictly necessary).

### 5. Custom Hooks vs. Composables: A TypeScript Perspective

While the line between custom hooks and composables can be blurry, thinking about them through the lens of TypeScript can help clarify their purpose:

- **Custom Hooks:** Generally, custom hooks are more tightly coupled with the React component lifecycle. They often use other hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) internally. The return value is usually tailored to a specific component's needs. TypeScript is used to provide type-safety within the hook's internal logic and for the returned values.

- **Composables:** Composables are often more generic and can be used in various contexts, not just within React components. They might not rely on React hooks directly, or they might encapsulate more complex logic that involves multiple hooks and external dependencies. TypeScript is used to define the input and output types of the composable, making it reusable and predictable across different parts of your application.

In practice, you can often use custom hooks and composables interchangeably. The key is to choose the approach that best suits the specific logic you're trying to encapsulate and reuse.

### 6. Testing TypeScript Composables

Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability of your composables. When using TypeScript, you can leverage type information to write more precise and effective tests. Here's an example using Jest and React Testing Library:

```typescript
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks'
import useCounter from './useCounter'

describe('useCounter', () => {
  it('should initialize the count to the initial value', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(10))
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(10)
  })

  it('should increment the count by 1', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0))
    act(() => {
      result.current.increment()
    })
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1)
  })

  it('should decrement the count by 1', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(5))
    act(() => {
      result.current.decrement()
    })
    expect(result.current.count).toBe(4)
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We use `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-hooks` to render the composable within a testing environment.
- We use `act` to wrap any state updates to ensure that the component is properly re-rendered.
- We use `expect` to assert that the composable behaves as expected.
- TypeScript helps ensure that you're calling the composable with the correct input types and that you're asserting the correct output types.

## Best Practices for Typing Composables

- **Define clear input and output types:** This is the foundation of type-safe composables.
- **Use interfaces and type aliases appropriately:** Interfaces are generally used for defining object types, while type aliases can be used for more complex type definitions, such as union types or intersection types.
- **Leverage generic types for flexibility:** Make your composables adaptable to different data types without sacrificing type safety.
- **Use functional updates with `useState`:** Ensure predictable state updates, especially when dealing with complex state.
- **Write comprehensive tests:** Test your composables thoroughly to ensure they behave as expected.
- **Document your composables:** Provide clear documentation, including type information and usage examples.
- **Consider using a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai) for more complex scenarios:** While composables are excellent for simple state management and reusable logic, a dedicated state management library might be more appropriate for larger and more complex applications.

## Conclusion

By mastering TypeScript and applying it to composables, you can significantly improve the quality, maintainability, and reusability of your React code. This approach not only reduces errors but also enhances the developer experience, making it easier to build robust and scalable applications. Remember to focus on defining clear types, leveraging generics when appropriate, and writing comprehensive tests to ensure your composables are reliable and predictable. Happy coding!
