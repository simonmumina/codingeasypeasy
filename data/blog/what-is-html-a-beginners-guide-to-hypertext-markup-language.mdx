# What is HTML? A Beginner's Guide to HyperText Markup Language

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It's the backbone of the internet, providing the structure and content that browsers display. If you're new to web development, understanding HTML is the crucial first step. This guide will walk you through the basics, explaining what HTML is, how it works, and how you can use it to build your own web pages.

## What Does "HyperText Markup Language" Mean?

Let's break down the name:

- **HyperText:** Refers to text that contains links to other text or resources. Clicking on a hyperlink takes you to another part of the same document or a completely different document.
- **Markup Language:** A language that uses tags to annotate text so that a computer can manipulate it. HTML uses tags to describe the structure and presentation of content.

In essence, HTML allows you to create documents with structured content and links that can be easily navigated on the web.

## The Basic Structure of an HTML Document

Every HTML document follows a basic structure. Here's a simplified example:

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's dissect this code:

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** This declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. It should always be the very first thing in your HTML file.
- **`<html>`:** The root element of the HTML page. Everything else is contained within this tag.
- **`<head>`:** Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title, character set, and links to stylesheets. This information is generally not displayed on the page itself, but it's important for the browser to understand the document.
- **`<title>`:** Specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or tab). This is also very important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
- **`<body>`:** Contains the visible page content. This is where you put the text, images, videos, and other elements that users will see.
- **`<h1>`:** Defines a level 1 heading. Headings range from `<h1>` (the most important) to `<h6>` (the least important). Use headings to structure your content logically.
- **`<p>`:** Defines a paragraph. Paragraphs are used for blocks of text.

## HTML Elements: The Building Blocks of Web Pages

HTML elements are the fundamental building blocks of HTML documents. They consist of a start tag, an end tag, and the content in between. For example:

- `<p>This is some text.</p>`

The `<p>` tag is the start tag, `</p>` is the end tag, and "This is some text." is the content. Some elements are _self-closing_ or _void_ elements and do not have an end tag. For example, the `<img>` tag (for images).

### Common HTML Elements

Here's a breakdown of some of the most frequently used HTML elements:

- **`<a>` (Anchor):** Defines a hyperlink, which is used to link to other pages or resources.

  ```plaintext
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
  ```

- **`<img>` (Image):** Embeds an image.

  ```plaintext
  <img src="my-image.jpg" alt="A descriptive image of something" width="500" height="300">
  ```

  **Important:** Always include the `alt` attribute to provide alternative text for screen readers and when the image cannot be loaded. This is important for accessibility and SEO. Also, consider setting `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shifting while the image loads.

- **`<ul>` (Unordered List) and `<ol>` (Ordered List):** Create lists. Unordered lists use bullet points, while ordered lists use numbers.

  ```plaintext
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>First Step</li>
    <li>Second Step</li>
    <li>Third Step</li>
  </ol>
  ```

- **`<div>` (Division):** A generic container element. It's often used to group other elements together for styling or layout purposes.

  ```plaintext
  <div class="container">
    <p>This content is inside a div.</p>
  </div>
  ```

- **`<span>`:** An inline container element. Similar to `<div>`, but used for smaller sections of text or inline elements.

  ```plaintext
  <p>This is <span style="color: red;">important</span> text.</p>
  ```

- **`<h1>` to `<h6>` (Headings):** Define heading levels. `<h1>` is the most important heading, and `<h6>` is the least important. Use them to structure your content hierarchically.

  ```plaintext
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <h2>Subheading</h2>
  <h3>Section Heading</h3>
  ```

- **`<form>`:** Creates an HTML form for user input.

  ```plaintext
  <form action="/submit-form" method="post">
    <label for="name">Name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
  ```

- **`<input>`:** Defines an input field within a form (e.g., text field, button, checkbox). The `type` attribute specifies the type of input.

- **`<button>`:** Defines a clickable button.

  ```plaintext
  <button type="button">Click Me!</button>
  ```

- **`<select>`:** Defines a dropdown list (used in forms).

  ```plaintext
  <select name="cars" id="cars">
    <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
    <option value="saab">Saab</option>
    <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
    <option value="audi">Audi</option>
  </select>
  ```

- **`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`:** Used to create tables. `<table>` is the container, `<tr>` defines a table row, `<th>` defines a table header cell, and `<td>` defines a table data cell.

  ```plaintext
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John Doe</td>
      <td>30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Jane Smith</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ```

## HTML Attributes: Adding Extra Information to Elements

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified in the start tag and usually consist of a name-value pair, like this:

```plaintext
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example (opens in a new tab)</a>
```

In this example:

- `href` is the attribute that specifies the URL of the link.
- `target` is an attribute that specifies where to open the linked document. `_blank` opens the link in a new tab or window.

### Common HTML Attributes

- **`class`:** Specifies one or more class names for an element (often used to link to a CSS stylesheet for styling).

  ```plaintext
  <p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
  ```

- **`id`:** Specifies a unique ID for an element (used for styling with CSS or selecting with JavaScript).

  ```plaintext
  <p id="uniqueParagraph">This paragraph has a unique ID.</p>
  ```

- **`style`:** Specifies inline CSS styles for an element. While this works, it's generally best practice to use external stylesheets or `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section for better organization and maintainability.

  ```plaintext
  <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This paragraph has inline styles.</p>
  ```

- **`src`:** Specifies the source (URL) of an image, audio, or video. Used with the `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` elements.

- **`alt`:** Specifies an alternate text for an image if the image cannot be displayed. Crucial for accessibility and SEO.

- **`href`:** Specifies the URL of a hyperlink. Used with the `<a>` element.

- **`title`:** Specifies extra information about an element (displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the element).

  ```plaintext
  <a href="https://www.example.com" title="Visit Example Website">Example Link</a>
  ```

- **`width` and `height`:** Specify the width and height of an element (usually used with images).

## HTML Semantics: Giving Meaning to Your Content

Semantic HTML is writing HTML that conveys the meaning and structure of your content to both browsers and developers. Instead of just using generic `<div>` elements everywhere, semantic HTML uses specific tags like `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` to define the different parts of a web page.

Using semantic HTML improves:

- **Accessibility:** Screen readers can better understand the structure of your content, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate your website.
- **SEO:** Search engines can better understand the content on your page, which can improve your search ranking.
- **Maintainability:** Code is easier to read and understand, making it easier to maintain and update.

Here's an example of a simple web page layout using semantic HTML:

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Semantic HTML Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
      <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>This is the main content of the article.</p>
      </article>

      <aside>
        <h3>Related Links</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Link 3</a></li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example:

- `<header>`: Contains the website's header, including the title and navigation.
- `<nav>`: Defines the main navigation menu.
- `<main>`: Contains the main content of the page.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site.
- `<aside>`: Represents a section of a page that is tangentially related to the main content. Often used for sidebars.
- `<footer>`: Contains the website's footer, including copyright information.

## HTML Entities: Displaying Special Characters

HTML entities are used to display characters that are reserved in HTML or that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. They start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`).

Here are some common HTML entities:

- `&lt;`: Less than `(<)`
- `&gt;`: Greater than `(>)`
- `&amp;`: Ampersand `(&)`
- `&nbsp;`: Non-breaking space `( )`
- `&copy;`: Copyright symbol `(©)`

For example, to display "10 < 20" in HTML, you would use:

```plaintext
<p>10 &lt; 20</p>
```

## How HTML Works With CSS and JavaScript

While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls its visual presentation (e.g., colors, fonts, layout). JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page (e.g., animations, form validation, AJAX requests).

These three technologies work together to create a complete web experience.

- **HTML (Structure):** Provides the skeleton of the page.
- **CSS (Styling):** Adds the visual appeal.
- **JavaScript (Behavior):** Makes the page interactive.

You can link CSS stylesheets to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

```plaintext
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

You can embed JavaScript code in your HTML document using the `<script>` tag:

```plaintext
<body>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

Or you can add inline styles with CSS within HTML Tags:

```plaintext
<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
```

## Best Practices for Writing HTML

- **Use valid HTML:** Validate your HTML code using a validator tool (like the W3C Markup Validation Service) to ensure that it is well-formed and follows the HTML standard.
- **Use semantic HTML:** Use semantic tags whenever possible to improve accessibility and SEO.
- **Write clean and organized code:** Indent your code properly and add comments to make it easier to read and maintain.
- **Optimize images:** Use appropriately sized images and optimize them for the web to improve page load speed.
- **Test your website:** Test your website on different browsers and devices to ensure that it looks and functions correctly.
- **Prioritize accessibility:** Make sure your website is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines (WCAG).
