# Create Interactive Star Ratings with Pure CSS: A Comprehensive Guide

Star ratings are a ubiquitous part of the web, appearing everywhere from product reviews to movie ratings. They provide a quick and visual way for users to express their opinion or provide feedback. While JavaScript libraries offer pre-built solutions, building a star rating system using only CSS offers several advantages:

- **Lightweight:** Eliminates the need for external libraries, reducing page load times.
- **Performance:** CSS-based solutions are generally faster than JavaScript alternatives.
- **Simplicity:** The core logic is relatively straightforward, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Accessibility:** With proper implementation, CSS-only star ratings can be made accessible to users with disabilities.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of creating an interactive and accessible star rating component using only CSS. We'll cover everything from the basic HTML structure to advanced styling and accessibility considerations.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
- A text editor or IDE for writing code.
- A web browser to view your results.

## Step 1: HTML Structure

The foundation of our star rating system will be a series of radio buttons wrapped within a `div`. Each radio button will represent a star. We'll use labels associated with the radio buttons to display the star icons.

```plaintext
<div class="rating">
  <input type="radio" id="star5" name="rating" value="5" />
  <label for="star5" title="5 stars">5 stars</label>

  <input type="radio" id="star4" name="rating" value="4" />
  <label for="star4" title="4 stars">4 stars</label>

  <input type="radio" id="star3" name="rating" value="3" />
  <label for="star3" title="3 stars">3 stars</label>

  <input type="radio" id="star2" name="rating" value="2" />
  <label for="star2" title="2 stars">2 stars</label>

  <input type="radio" id="star1" name="rating" value="1" />
  <label for="star1" title="1 star</label>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`div class="rating"`:** This container wraps the entire rating component. It provides a convenient way to apply overall styles and layout.
- **`input type="radio"`:** Each radio button represents a rating value (1 to 5 stars). The `name="rating"` attribute groups these radio buttons, ensuring that only one can be selected at a time. The `value` attribute will hold the numeric star rating selected by the user.
- **`label for="star[1-5]"`:** The labels are associated with their respective radio buttons using the `for` attribute. Clicking the label will automatically select the associated radio button. The `title` attribute provides a descriptive tooltip when hovering over the star. This is helpful for accessibility.

## Step 2: Basic CSS Styling

Now, let's add some basic CSS to hide the radio buttons and style the labels to display star icons. We will use the Unicode star character (★) as our icon.

```plaintext
.rating {
  display: inline-block;
}

.rating input {
  display: none; /* Hide the radio buttons */
}

.rating label {
  float: right; /* Display stars in reverse order */
  font-size: 2em; /* Adjust star size */
  color: #ddd; /* Light grey color for unselected stars */
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`.rating`:** Sets the display to `inline-block` to allow the rating component to be placed inline with other elements.
- **`.rating input`:** `display: none;` completely hides the radio buttons, making only the labels visible.
- **`.rating label`:**
  - `float: right;` This is crucial. By floating the labels to the right, we ensure that the stars are rendered in reverse order (5, 4, 3, 2, 1) from left to right, which is the intuitive order for a star rating.
  - `font-size: 2em;` Controls the size of the star icons. Adjust this value to your preference.
  - `color: #ddd;` Sets the default color of the stars to a light grey, indicating an unselected state.
  - `cursor: pointer;` Changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering over a star, indicating that it's clickable.

## Step 3: Implementing the Star Rating Logic with CSS `:hover` and `:checked`

The core of the star rating functionality comes from CSS's `:hover` and `:checked` pseudo-classes. We'll use these to dynamically change the color of the stars when the user hovers over them or selects them.

```plaintext
.rating input:checked ~ label {
  color: #ffc107; /* Gold color for selected stars */
}

.rating label:hover,
.rating label:hover ~ label {
  color: #ffc107; /* Gold color for hovered stars */
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`.rating input:checked ~ label`:** This is the key selector. It selects all labels that are siblings of a checked input (radio button). The `~` (general sibling selector) selects all sibling labels _after_ the checked input. Therefore, when a radio button is checked, this style applies to all stars to the left of and including the selected star, effectively highlighting the selected rating and all stars below it. `color: #ffc107;` sets the color of these stars to gold.
- **`.rating label:hover, .rating label:hover ~ label`:** This selector handles the hover effect.
  - `.rating label:hover` styles the star that is currently being hovered over.
  - `.rating label:hover ~ label` styles all the stars to the left of the hovered star. This creates the visual effect of highlighting all stars up to the hovered star, even if the user hasn't clicked anything yet. `color: #ffc107;` again sets the color to gold for the hovered stars.

## Step 4: Fine-Tuning and Customization

You can further customize the star rating by adjusting the colors, sizes, and spacing of the stars. Here are some ideas:

- **Different Star Icons:** Instead of the Unicode star character, you could use Font Awesome icons or custom SVG icons.

  ```plaintext
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css"
    integrity="sha512-9usAa10IRO0HhonpyAIVpjrylPvoDwiPUiKdWk5t3PyolY1cOd4DSE0Ga+ri4AuTroPR5aQvXU9xC6qOPnzFeg=="
    crossorigin="anonymous"
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
  />
  ```

  ```plaintext
  .rating label i {
    font-size: 2em;
  }
  .rating label {
      float: right;
      cursor: pointer;
  }

  .rating input {
    display: none;
  }

  .rating input:checked ~ label i {
    color: #ffc107;
  }

  .rating label:hover i,
  .rating label:hover ~ label i {
    color: #ffc107;
  }
  ```

  Then, in your HTML, replace the text "5 stars", "4 stars", etc. with the Font Awesome star icon code: `<i class="fas fa-star"></i>`.

- **Half-Star Ratings:** Implementing half-star ratings with pure CSS is more complex and often involves using gradients or more sophisticated techniques. It's generally recommended to use JavaScript for half-star ratings if precise control is required.

- **Spacing:** Adjust the spacing between the stars using `margin` or `padding` on the label elements.

## Step 5: Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is crucial for ensuring that your star rating component is usable by everyone, including users with disabilities. Here's how to improve accessibility:

- **`title` Attribute:** As shown in the HTML example, the `title` attribute on each label provides a descriptive text for screen readers. This helps users understand the meaning of each star.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** While the radio buttons are hidden, they are still present in the DOM. Users can navigate through them using the Tab key. Make sure the visual focus state is clearly visible when a radio button is focused (e.g., using the `:focus` pseudo-class and a `outline` property).

  ```plaintext
  .rating input:focus + label {
    outline: 2px solid blue; /* Adjust the color and style as needed */
  }
  ```

- **ARIA Attributes (Advanced):** For more advanced accessibility, you can use ARIA attributes to provide more semantic information about the rating component. This is particularly helpful if you are implementing more complex rating systems. For example, you could use `aria-label` on the rating container to provide a general description of the rating component. You could also add `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow` attributes to provide screen readers with information about the minimum, maximum, and current value of the rating.

  ```plaintext
  <div
    class="rating"
    aria-label="Rate this product"
    aria-valuemin="1"
    aria-valuemax="5"
    aria-valuenow="0"
  ></div>
  ```

**Important Note:** ARIA attributes should be used judiciously and only when the native HTML elements do not provide sufficient semantic information. In many cases, the `title` attribute and proper keyboard navigation handling are sufficient for a basic star rating component.

## Complete Example

Here's the complete code for the CSS-only star rating component:

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>CSS Star Rating</title>
    <style>
      .rating {
        display: inline-block;
      }

      .rating input {
        display: none;
      }

      .rating label {
        float: right;
        font-size: 2em;
        color: #ddd;
        cursor: pointer;
      }

      .rating input:checked ~ label {
        color: #ffc107;
      }

      .rating label:hover,
      .rating label:hover ~ label {
        color: #ffc107;
      }
      .rating input:focus + label {
        outline: 2px solid blue; /* Adjust the color and style as needed */
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="rating">
      <input type="radio" id="star5" name="rating" value="5" />
      <label for="star5" title="5 stars">★</label>

      <input type="radio" id="star4" name="rating" value="4" />
      <label for="star4" title="4 stars">★</label>

      <input type="radio" id="star3" name="rating" value="3" />
      <label for="star3" title="3 stars">★</label>

      <input type="radio" id="star2" name="rating" value="2" />
      <label for="star2" title="2 stars">★</label>

      <input type="radio" id="star1" name="rating" value="1" />
      <label for="star1" title="1 star">★</label>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
