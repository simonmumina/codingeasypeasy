# Enable GZIP Compression in Spring Boot: Boost Website Performance

In today's fast-paced digital world, website performance is crucial for user experience and search engine rankings. Slow loading times can lead to frustrated users and lower conversion rates. One of the most effective ways to improve your website's performance is by enabling GZIP compression. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to easily enable GZIP compression in your Spring Boot application.

## What is GZIP Compression?

GZIP is a popular data compression algorithm that reduces the size of HTTP responses sent from your server to the client's browser. By compressing the data before it's transmitted, you can significantly reduce the amount of bandwidth used and decrease the time it takes for the browser to download and render the page. This leads to a faster and more responsive user experience.

Think of it like sending a package: instead of sending a bulky package of unorganized items, you compress the items and package them tightly into a smaller box. GZIP does the same thing for your website's data.

## Why Use GZIP Compression in Spring Boot?

Here are some compelling reasons to enable GZIP compression in your Spring Boot application:

- **Improved Website Speed:** Reduced response sizes translate to faster download times, leading to quicker page loads and a better user experience.
- **Reduced Bandwidth Consumption:** By compressing data, you consume less bandwidth, which can save you money on hosting costs, especially if you have high traffic volumes.
- **Enhanced SEO:** Search engines like Google consider website speed as a ranking factor. A faster website can improve your search engine rankings.
- **Better User Experience:** Faster loading times lead to happier users who are more likely to stay on your website and engage with your content.

## Enabling GZIP Compression in Spring Boot: A Step-by-Step Guide

There are several ways to enable GZIP compression in a Spring Boot application. We'll cover the most common and effective approaches.

### 1. Using `server.compression` Properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`

The simplest way to enable GZIP compression is by configuring the `server.compression` properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

**Example using `application.properties`:**

```properties
server.compression.enabled=true
server.compression.mime-types=text/html,text/xml,text/plain,text/css,text/javascript,application/javascript,application/json
server.compression.min-response-size=2048
```

**Example using `application.yml`:**

```plaintext
server:
  compression:
    enabled: true
    mime-types: text/html,text/xml,text/plain,text/css,text/javascript,application/javascript,application/json
    min-response-size: 2048
```

Let's break down these properties:

- **`server.compression.enabled=true`:** This enables GZIP compression for your application. Setting it to `false` disables it.
- **`server.compression.mime-types`:** This specifies the MIME types that should be compressed. By default, Spring Boot compresses `text/html`, `text/xml`, `text/plain`, `text/css`, and `application/json`. You can add or remove MIME types as needed. Ensure you include common types like `text/javascript` and `application/javascript` for JavaScript files.
- **`server.compression.min-response-size`:** This sets the minimum size (in bytes) of a response that should be compressed. Compressing very small responses can actually increase the overall size due to the compression overhead. A common value is `2048` (2KB). Adjust this value based on your application's needs.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers generally support GZIP compression. The browser sends an `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate` header in its request to indicate its support for compression. The server then compresses the response and adds a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the response, indicating that the content is compressed.
- **Performance Impact:** While GZIP compression generally improves performance, the compression process itself can consume CPU resources on the server. The `min-response-size` property helps mitigate this by avoiding compression of small responses.
- **Proxy Servers:** If you are using a proxy server or CDN in front of your Spring Boot application, make sure it is configured to support GZIP compression. Some proxy servers may strip the `Content-Encoding` header, preventing the browser from decompressing the response.

### 2. Using a Servlet Filter (Programmatic Approach)

Another way to enable GZIP compression is by creating a custom servlet filter. This approach gives you more control over the compression process.

```plaintext
import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.FilterRegistrationBean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream;

@Configuration
public class GzipFilterConfig {

    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean<GzipFilter> gzipFilterRegistrationBean() {
        FilterRegistrationBean<GzipFilter> registrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean<>();
        registrationBean.setFilter(new GzipFilter());
        registrationBean.addUrlPatterns("/*"); // Apply to all URLs
        registrationBean.setOrder(1); // Set the order of the filter
        return registrationBean;
    }

    public static class GzipFilter implements Filter {

        @Override
        public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
                throws IOException, ServletException {

            HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;
            HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;

            if (acceptsGzipEncoding(httpRequest)) {
                GzipResponseWrapper gzipResponse = new GzipResponseWrapper(httpResponse);
                chain.doFilter(request, gzipResponse);

                if (gzipResponse.needsCompression()) {
                    gzipResponse.finish();
                    httpResponse.setHeader("Content-Encoding", "gzip");
                }
            } else {
                chain.doFilter(request, response);
            }
        }

        private boolean acceptsGzipEncoding(HttpServletRequest httpRequest) {
            String acceptEncoding = httpRequest.getHeader("Accept-Encoding");
            return acceptEncoding != null && acceptEncoding.contains("gzip");
        }
    }

    // Custom Response Wrapper
    static class GzipResponseWrapper extends HttpServletResponseWrapper {
        private GZIPOutputStream gzipOutputStream = null;
        private ServletOutputStream servletOutputStream = null;
        private boolean needsCompression = false;

        public GzipResponseWrapper(HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
            super(response);
        }

        @Override
        public ServletOutputStream getOutputStream() throws IOException {
            if (servletOutputStream == null) {
                if (gzipOutputStream != null) {
                    throw new IllegalStateException("getOutputStream() called after getWriter()");
                }
                servletOutputStream = getResponse().getOutputStream();
            }
            return servletOutputStream;
        }

        @Override
        public java.io.PrintWriter getWriter() throws IOException {
            if (gzipOutputStream != null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("getWriter() called after getOutputStream()");
            }
            if (servletOutputStream != null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("getWriter() called after getOutputStream()");
            }
            return getResponse().getWriter();
        }

        public void finish() throws IOException {
            if (gzipOutputStream != null) {
                gzipOutputStream.finish();
                gzipOutputStream.close();
            }
        }

        public boolean needsCompression() {
            return needsCompression;
        }

        public void setNeedsCompression(boolean needsCompression) {
            this.needsCompression = needsCompression;
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`GzipFilterConfig` Class:** This class is annotated with `@Configuration` to indicate that it's a Spring configuration class.
2.  **`gzipFilterRegistrationBean()` Method:** This method creates a `FilterRegistrationBean` and registers our custom `GzipFilter`.
    - `registrationBean.setFilter(new GzipFilter());`: Sets the filter to be registered.
    - `registrationBean.addUrlPatterns("/*");`: Specifies the URL patterns that the filter should apply to (in this case, all URLs). You can change this to be more specific.
    - `registrationBean.setOrder(1);`: Sets the order in which the filter is executed. Lower values mean the filter is executed earlier.
3.  **`GzipFilter` Class:** This class implements the `Filter` interface and performs the GZIP compression.
    - **`doFilter()` Method:** This method is the core of the filter. It checks if the client accepts GZIP encoding and, if so, wraps the response with a `GzipResponseWrapper`. It then calls `chain.doFilter()` to pass the request and wrapped response to the next filter in the chain or the servlet. Finally, it finishes the compression process if `needsCompression()` is true.
    - **`acceptsGzipEncoding()` Method:** This method checks the `Accept-Encoding` header in the request to see if the client accepts GZIP encoding.
4.  **`GzipResponseWrapper` Class:** This class extends `HttpServletResponseWrapper` and provides the necessary functionality to wrap the response stream with a `GZIPOutputStream`. It handles the actual compression and setting of the `Content-Encoding` header.

**How this filter works:**

- The filter intercepts all incoming requests that match the specified URL patterns.
- It checks the `Accept-Encoding` header to see if the client supports GZIP.
- If the client supports GZIP, the filter wraps the response with a custom `GzipResponseWrapper`. This wrapper intercepts the output stream and compresses the data using `GZIPOutputStream`.
- The filter adds the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the response.
- The compressed response is then sent back to the client.

**Advantages of using a Servlet Filter:**

- **More Control:** You have more fine-grained control over the compression process, such as excluding certain URLs from compression or customizing the compression level.
- **Flexibility:** You can easily modify the filter to add custom logic or handle different scenarios.

**Disadvantages:**

- **More Code:** This approach requires more code than the `application.properties` method.

### 3. Using Spring Boot's Embedded Servlet Container (Automatic Configuration)

Spring Boot provides an auto-configuration mechanism that automatically enables GZIP compression if certain conditions are met. This is generally the preferred approach.

**Requirements:**

- You must be using an embedded servlet container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow). This is the default in most Spring Boot applications.
- You must have the `server.compression.enabled` property set to `true` in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file (as described in section 1).

If these conditions are met, Spring Boot will automatically configure GZIP compression using the settings you provide in your configuration file.

**This method relies on the `CompressionAutoConfiguration` class within Spring Boot. This class automatically configures the embedded servlet container to use GZIP compression.**

**Benefits:**

- **Simple and Convenient:** Minimal configuration required.
- **Automatic:** Spring Boot handles the details of configuring the servlet container.

**Drawbacks:**

- **Less Control:** You have less control over the compression process compared to using a servlet filter.

## Testing GZIP Compression

After enabling GZIP compression, it's important to verify that it's working correctly. You can do this using several methods:

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) and go to the "Network" tab. Reload your page and inspect the headers of the HTTP responses. You should see a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header if compression is enabled. You should also see a smaller "Size" value for the response compared to the "Content" value (which represents the uncompressed size).

- **Online GZIP Test Tools:** There are many online tools that can test whether your website is using GZIP compression. Simply enter your website's URL and the tool will analyze the HTTP headers.

- **Command-Line Tools:** Use `curl` or `wget` to request your website with the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header and then inspect the response headers.

```plaintext
curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -I https://www.example.com
```

Look for the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header in the output.

## Best Practices for GZIP Compression in Spring Boot

- **Compress Static Assets:** Ensure that you are compressing static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images (although images are often already compressed, so double compression may not be beneficial and could even increase file size in some cases). Many web servers and CDNs have built-in support for GZIP compressing static assets.
- **Use Appropriate Compression Level:** Most GZIP libraries allow you to configure the compression level. Higher compression levels result in smaller files but require more CPU resources. Experiment with different compression levels to find the optimal balance between compression ratio and CPU usage.
- **Monitor Performance:** After enabling GZIP compression, monitor your website's performance to ensure that it's actually improving. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to track your website's loading times.
- **Consider Brotli:** Brotli is a newer compression algorithm that often provides better compression ratios than GZIP. If your clients support Brotli (most modern browsers do), consider using it instead of or in addition to GZIP. Spring Boot provides support for Brotli compression through configuration of the underlying servlet container.
