# Elevate Your Contentlayer Blog: Syntax Highlighting with Shiki and Prism

Creating a blog with Contentlayer is a fantastic way to manage and display your content in a structured and efficient manner. However, displaying code snippets without proper syntax highlighting can make your technical articles difficult to read and understand. This post will guide you through adding syntax highlighting to your Contentlayer blog using two popular solutions: **Shiki** and **Prism.js**. We'll cover the pros and cons of each, and provide step-by-step instructions to implement them.

## Why Syntax Highlighting Matters

Syntax highlighting significantly improves the readability and comprehension of code within your blog posts. By visually differentiating keywords, comments, variables, and other elements, it helps readers quickly grasp the structure and logic of the code. This leads to a better user experience and encourages engagement with your technical content.

## Choosing Your Syntax Highlighting Solution: Shiki vs. Prism.js

Both Shiki and Prism.js are excellent choices for syntax highlighting, but they have different strengths and weaknesses:

**Shiki:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Beautiful and accurate:** Shiki uses the same TextMate grammars and themes as VS Code, providing highly accurate and visually appealing highlighting.
    *   **Server-side rendering friendly:** Shiki is designed for server-side rendering, making it ideal for pre-rendering your code snippets for optimal performance and SEO.
    *   **Customizable themes:** Offers a wide range of pre-built themes and the ability to create custom ones.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Larger bundle size:** Shiki's reliance on TextMate grammars can result in a larger bundle size compared to Prism.js.
    *   **Requires more setup:** Integrating Shiki often involves more configuration compared to Prism.js.

**Prism.js:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Lightweight:** Prism.js is a very lightweight library, making it a good choice for projects where bundle size is a critical concern.
    *   **Easy to use:** Prism.js is incredibly easy to set up and use with minimal configuration.
    *   **Extensive language support:** Offers support for a wide variety of programming languages and markup languages.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Less accurate highlighting:** Prism.js's highlighting might not be as accurate as Shiki, especially for less common languages.
    *   **Client-side rendering focused:** Primarily designed for client-side rendering, which can impact initial page load performance if not optimized correctly.

**In summary:** If you prioritize accuracy and visual appeal and are willing to accept a slightly larger bundle size, **Shiki is the better choice.** If you need a lightweight and easy-to-use solution and are less concerned about absolute accuracy, **Prism.js is a great option.**

## Option 1: Implementing Syntax Highlighting with Shiki in Contentlayer

This guide will show you how to integrate Shiki with your Contentlayer project using Next.js. We'll assume you already have a Contentlayer project set up.

**1. Install Shiki and Remark Rehype:**

```bash
npm install shiki remark-rehype
```

**2. Configure `contentlayer.config.ts`:**

Modify your `contentlayer.config.ts` (or similar) file to process MDX files with Shiki.  You'll need to use `remark-rehype` to transform the markdown code blocks into HTML that Shiki can then style.

```typescript
// contentlayer.config.ts
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'
import rehypePrettyCode from 'rehype-pretty-code'; // Added
import { rehypeAccessibleEmojis } from 'rehype-accessible-emojis';
import rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug';
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings';

export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  filePathPattern: `**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: 'mdx',
  fields: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    date: { type: 'date', required: true },
    lastmod: { type: 'date' },
    tags: { type: 'list', of: { type: 'string' } },
    draft: { type: 'boolean' },
    summary: { type: 'string' },
    authors: { type: 'list', of: { type: 'string' } },
  },
  computedFields: {
    url: { type: 'string', resolve: (post) => `/posts/${post._raw.flattenedPath}` },
  },
}))

const options = {
  theme: 'github-dark', // Choose your Shiki theme
  onVisitLine(ast: any) {
    // You can add line numbers here, but it's optional
    if (ast.children.length === 0) {
      ast.children = [{ type: 'text', value: ' ' }]
    }
  },
  onVisitHighlightedLine(ast: any) {
    ast.properties.className.push('line--highlighted')
  },
  onVisitHighlightedWord(ast: any) {
    ast.properties.className = ['word']
  },
}

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: 'content',
  documentTypes: [Post],
  mdx: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [
      rehypeSlug,
      rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
      rehypeAccessibleEmojis,
      [rehypePrettyCode, options],
    ],
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

*   `rehypePrettyCode`: This is the official plugin for using Shiki with `rehype`.  It handles the transformation of code blocks.
*   `theme: 'github-dark'`: Specifies the Shiki theme you want to use. You can find a list of available themes in the Shiki documentation.  Popular choices include `'github-light'`, `'dracula'`, and `'monokai'`.
*   `onVisitLine`, `onVisitHighlightedLine`, `onVisitHighlightedWord`: These are optional functions that allow you to customize the appearance of the code blocks further.  In this example, `onVisitLine` adds a space to empty lines, `onVisitHighlightedLine` adds a class for highlighting specific lines, and `onVisitHighlightedWord` adds a class for highlighting specific words.  You'll need to implement your own styling in your CSS.

**3. Add Styling:**

Add CSS to your project to style the highlighted code. Create a `global.css` or a similar CSS file if you don't already have one.

```css
/* global.css or similar */
.rehype-pretty-code-fragment {
  position: relative;
}

.rehype-pretty-code-title {
  font-size: 1em;
  padding: 0.5em;
  margin-bottom: -1px; /* prevent the title from adding extra padding */
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  border-radius: 0.5em 0.5em 0 0;
}

.rehype-pretty-code-pre {
    background-color: #0d1117 !important;
    border-radius: 0.5em;
    overflow-x: auto;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    font-family: "Fira Code", monospace !important;
    font-style: normal;
}

.line--highlighted {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  margin-right: -1em;
  margin-left: -1em;
  padding-right: 1em;
  padding-left: 1em;
  border-left: 0.25em solid rgb(173, 219, 103);
}

.word {
  color: #c9d1d9;
  padding: 0.25em;
  border-radius: 0.25em;
  font-style: italic;
}

/* Fira Code font */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Fira Code';
  src: url('/fonts/FiraCode-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('/fonts/FiraCode-Regular.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
    font-family: "Fira Code";
    src: url("/fonts/FiraCode-Bold.woff2") format("woff2");
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: normal;
    font-display: swap;
}

/* Add more styles as needed to match your blog's design */
```

**Important Considerations for Shiki:**

*   **Fonts:**  The CSS above uses the "Fira Code" font, a popular monospace font designed for code.  Make sure you download this font and place it in your `public/fonts` directory (or adjust the path in the CSS).  You can download Fira Code from [https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Without a suitable monospace font, your code will not render correctly.
*   **Themes:**  Explore different Shiki themes to find one that matches your blog's aesthetics.  Update the `theme` option in `contentlayer.config.ts` accordingly.
*   **Customization:**  The `onVisitLine`, `onVisitHighlightedLine`, and `onVisitHighlightedWord` functions are powerful tools for customizing the appearance of your code blocks. Use them to add line numbers, highlight specific lines, or customize the styling of individual words.
*   **Server-Side Rendering:** Shiki is designed for server-side rendering. Contentlayer will handle this automatically.

**4. Use in your MDX file**

You can now include code blocks in your MDX files using standard markdown syntax:

```mdx
## Example Code Snippet

Here's a basic JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

This code demonstrates a simple greeting function.
```

Contentlayer will now process this MDX file, and Shiki will highlight the code snippet according to the specified theme and styling.

## Option 2: Implementing Syntax Highlighting with Prism.js in Contentlayer

**1. Install Prism.js:**

```bash
npm install prismjs
```

**2. Configure your layout component or _app.js:**

You'll need to import Prism.js and its associated CSS in your layout component or `_app.js`. This ensures that Prism.js is loaded on every page.  Since we want to avoid client-side rendering as much as possible, we'll try to load the prism css server-side within next.js.

```javascript
// _app.js or layout.js
import '../styles/global.css';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Prism from 'prismjs';
import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css'; // Choose your Prism.js theme

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    Prism.highlightAll();
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

**Explanation:**

*   `import Prism from 'prismjs';`: Imports the Prism.js library.
*   `import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css';`: Imports a Prism.js theme. You can find a variety of themes on the Prism.js website. Common choices include `prism.css`, `prism-tomorrow.css`, and `prism-okaidia.css`.
*   `useEffect(() => { Prism.highlightAll(); }, []);`:  This `useEffect` hook runs after the component mounts.  `Prism.highlightAll()` applies syntax highlighting to all code blocks on the page. The empty dependency array `[]` ensures that this effect runs only once after the initial render.

**3. Choose Your Languages and Plugins:**

Prism.js is modular.  You need to explicitly include the languages you want to support and any plugins you want to use.  To do this, you'll import them after importing the main Prism.js library.

For example, to support JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and to add the "line numbers" plugin:

```javascript
// _app.js or layout.js
import '../styles/global.css';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Prism from 'prismjs';
import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css'; // Choose your Prism.js theme
import 'prismjs/components/prism-javascript';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-css';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-markup'; // HTML, XML
import 'prismjs/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.css';
import 'prismjs/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    Prism.highlightAll();
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

**Important:**  Make sure you install the CSS for any plugins you use (e.g., `prism-line-numbers.css`).

**4. Use in your MDX file:**

Same as Shiki, include code blocks in your MDX files using standard markdown syntax:

```mdx
## Example Code Snippet

Here's a basic JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

This code demonstrates a simple greeting function.
```

Prism.js will automatically highlight the code snippet.  Make sure the code block is correctly identified with the correct language (e.g., `javascript`, `css`, `html`).

**Important Considerations for Prism.js:**

*   **Language Support:**  Carefully select the languages you need to support.  Adding unnecessary languages will increase your bundle size.
*   **Plugins:**  Explore the available Prism.js plugins.  Plugins like "line numbers" and "copy to clipboard" can greatly enhance the user experience.
*   **Themes:**  Choose a Prism.js theme that matches your blog's style.
*   **Client-Side vs. Server-Side:** While Prism.js is primarily client-side, Next.js and Contentlayer work best with solutions that can be pre-rendered. In the example provided, `Prism.highlightAll()` runs in a `useEffect` hook. The browser will run Prism and highlight the code after the page has loaded.

## Conclusion

Adding syntax highlighting is crucial for improving the readability and user experience of your technical blog posts. Whether you choose Shiki for its accuracy and server-side rendering capabilities or Prism.js for its lightweight nature and ease of use, implementing syntax highlighting will elevate your Contentlayer blog and make your code snippets more accessible and engaging for your audience.  Remember to consider your specific needs and priorities when choosing the right solution for your project. Happy coding!
