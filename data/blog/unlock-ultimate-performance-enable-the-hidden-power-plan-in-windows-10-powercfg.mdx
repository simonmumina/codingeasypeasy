# Unlock Ultimate Performance: Enable the Hidden Power Plan in Windows 10 (powercfg)

Windows 10 offers several power plans designed to balance performance and energy consumption.  While the standard options like "Balanced" and "High Performance" are readily available, a hidden power plan called "Ultimate Performance" exists and is specifically designed for workstations and demanding applications where maximizing performance is paramount.  This guide will walk you through the simple steps to unlock and enable this hidden power plan using the command line (`powercfg`).

## What is the "Ultimate Performance" Power Plan?

The "Ultimate Performance" power plan is engineered to provide the absolute best possible performance in Windows 10.  It goes beyond the "High Performance" plan by aggressively optimizing power settings to favor speed and responsiveness.  This means faster CPU speeds, quicker storage access, and optimized graphics performance.

**Who is this for?**

*   **Gamers:**  Experience smoother frame rates and reduced input lag.
*   **Content Creators:**  Enjoy faster rendering times for video editing, 3D modeling, and other resource-intensive tasks.
*   **Professionals:** Benefit from quicker application load times and improved responsiveness in demanding software.

**Important Note:**  This power plan prioritizes performance over energy conservation. Expect increased power consumption and potentially higher temperatures, especially on laptops.  Consider using it only when you need maximum performance and switch back to a more balanced plan for everyday tasks.

## Enabling the "Ultimate Performance" Power Plan

Enabling the "Ultimate Performance" power plan involves using the command line (CMD) with administrative privileges. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Open Command Prompt as Administrator**

1.  Click the Windows Start button.
2.  Type "cmd" in the search bar.
3.  Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator".

**Step 2: Execute the `powercfg` Command**

In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:

```
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61
```

This command uses the `powercfg` utility to duplicate a pre-defined power scheme with the GUID `e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61`, which is the GUID for the "Ultimate Performance" power plan.

**Code Explanation:**

*   `powercfg`:  The command-line utility for managing power settings in Windows.
*   `-duplicatescheme`:  The switch that tells `powercfg` to create a copy of an existing power scheme.
*   `e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61`: The GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) that uniquely identifies the "Ultimate Performance" power plan.

**Step 3: Verify and Activate the Power Plan**

After running the command, you should see a GUID returned in the command prompt window.  This GUID is unique to *your* newly created "Ultimate Performance" power plan.

1.  **Open the Power Options:**  Right-click on the battery icon in your system tray (lower right corner of your screen) and select "Power Options".  Alternatively, you can search for "Power Options" in the Windows search bar and open it from there.

2.  **Locate the "Ultimate Performance" Plan:**  In the Power Options window, you should now see the "Ultimate Performance" power plan listed under "Choose or customize a power plan".  It may be under the "Show additional plans" dropdown.

3.  **Select the "Ultimate Performance" Plan:**  Click on the radio button next to "Ultimate Performance" to activate it.

**Step 4 (Optional): Customize the Power Plan Settings**

While the "Ultimate Performance" plan is pre-configured, you can further customize it to fine-tune its behavior to your specific needs.

1.  **Click "Change plan settings"** next to the "Ultimate Performance" plan.

2.  **Modify advanced power settings:** Click on "Change advanced power settings".  A new window will open with a list of customizable settings.

    **Here are some settings you might want to adjust:**

    *   **Hard disk > Turn off hard disk after:**  Set this to "Never" to ensure your hard drives are always powered on for maximum speed.  (Laptop users should consider the impact on battery life).
    *   **Wireless Adapter Settings > Power Saving Mode:**  Set this to "Maximum Performance" to prevent the wireless adapter from throttling its performance.
    *   **Sleep > Sleep after/Hibernate after:**  Consider setting these to "Never" if you want your computer to stay fully active.  (Again, laptop users should be mindful of battery drain).
    *   **USB settings > USB selective suspend setting:** Disable this to ensure USB devices are always powered.
    *   **Processor power management > Minimum processor state:**  Set this to 100% to ensure the processor is always running at its maximum frequency. (Increase power consumption considerably)
    *   **Processor power management > Maximum processor state:**  Set this to 100% to ensure the processor is always running at its maximum frequency.

3.  **Click "Apply" and "OK"** to save your changes.

**Example of adjusting Processor Power Management:**

1.  Expand "Processor power management".
2.  Expand "Minimum processor state".
3.  Change "On battery" and "Plugged in" to `100%`.
4.  Expand "Maximum processor state".
5.  Change "On battery" and "Plugged in" to `100%`.
6.  Click "Apply" and "OK".

## Reverting to a Different Power Plan

If you find that the "Ultimate Performance" power plan is consuming too much power or causing overheating, you can easily switch back to a different power plan:

1.  Open Power Options (as described in Step 3 above).
2.  Select a different power plan, such as "Balanced" or "High Performance".

## Deleting the "Ultimate Performance" Power Plan (Optional)

If you no longer need the "Ultimate Performance" power plan, you can delete it using the `powercfg` command.  First, you need to find the GUID of your "Ultimate Performance" power plan:

1.  Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2.  Type `powercfg /list` and press Enter.
3.  Locate the "Ultimate Performance" power plan in the list.  It will be labeled something like "Ultimate Performance (GUID: [your GUID])".  **Copy the GUID**.

Now, use the following command to delete the power plan, replacing `[your GUID]` with the actual GUID you copied:

```
powercfg /delete [your GUID]
```

For example:

```
powercfg /delete 8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Laptop Battery Life:**  The "Ultimate Performance" power plan will significantly reduce battery life on laptops. Use it sparingly when plugged in.
*   **Heat:**  Increased performance can lead to higher temperatures. Ensure your computer has adequate cooling.
*   **Compatibility:**  While generally safe, some older hardware or drivers may not be fully compatible with the "Ultimate Performance" power plan. If you experience instability, revert to a different power plan.
*   **SSD Lifespan:** Some aggressive optimization settings *could* theoretically reduce the lifespan of an SSD by increasing write cycles. However, modern SSDs are designed to handle a high volume of writes, so this is unlikely to be a significant concern for most users.  Adjust individual settings with care if concerned.
*   **Monitor Performance:** After enabling the power plan, monitor your system's performance using tools like Task Manager or dedicated benchmarking software to ensure it's delivering the expected benefits.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Ultimate Performance" not appearing after running the command:**  Double-check that you ran Command Prompt as administrator. If it still doesn't appear, restart your computer and try again.
*   **System instability:** Revert to a different power plan or try updating your drivers (especially graphics and chipset drivers).

## Conclusion

The "Ultimate Performance" power plan in Windows 10 can provide a noticeable boost in performance for demanding tasks and games. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily unlock and enable this hidden power plan and experience the full potential of your hardware. Remember to monitor your system's power consumption and temperature, especially on laptops, and adjust the power plan settings to suit your individual needs.  Enjoy the performance boost!
