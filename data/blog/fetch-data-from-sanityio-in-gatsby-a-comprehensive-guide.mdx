# Fetch Data from Sanity.io in Gatsby: A Comprehensive Guide

Gatsby.js is a popular static site generator known for its speed and performance. Sanity.io is a flexible and powerful headless CMS that provides structured content. Combining the two allows you to create blazing-fast websites with easily manageable content. This guide will walk you through the process of fetching data from Sanity.io into your Gatsby site, covering everything from initial setup to advanced querying.

## Why Gatsby and Sanity.io?

- **Performance:** Gatsby generates static HTML files during build time, resulting in incredibly fast load times.
- **Scalability:** Serving static files is highly scalable.
- **Content Management:** Sanity.io provides a real-time collaborative content editing experience with a structured data approach.
- **Developer Experience:** Gatsby offers a great developer experience with features like hot reloading and a rich plugin ecosystem. Sanity also provides a powerful GraphQL API.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:** Gatsby requires Node.js to run.
- **A Sanity.io account and project:** If you don't have one, create a free account at [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/).
- **A Gatsby project:** You can create a new Gatsby project using the Gatsby CLI: `gatsby new my-sanity-gatsby-site`.

## Step 1: Install the `gatsby-source-sanity` Plugin

The `gatsby-source-sanity` plugin is the official way to fetch data from Sanity.io into Gatsby. Install it using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install gatsby-source-sanity
# or
yarn add gatsby-source-sanity
```

## Step 2: Configure `gatsby-config.js`

Next, you need to configure the plugin in your `gatsby-config.js` file. This involves providing your Sanity project ID, dataset name, and API version.

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-sanity`,
      options: {
        projectId: process.env.SANITY_PROJECT_ID, // Replace with your project ID
        dataset: process.env.SANITY_DATASET || 'production', // Replace with your dataset name
        token: process.env.SANITY_TOKEN, // Only if you want to write data (optional)
        apiVersion: '2023-03-01', // Use a recent API version
        useCdn: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // Enable CDN in production
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **`projectId`:** Find your project ID in your Sanity project settings (API tab).
- **`dataset`:** Your dataset name (usually 'production' or 'development').
- **`token` (Optional):** Only required if you plan to use mutations to write data back to Sanity from your Gatsby site (e.g., for comments). For read-only access, you don't need a token. If you need a token, generate one in your Sanity project settings (API tab). Make sure to grant it the appropriate permissions.
- **`apiVersion`:** Specify a recent API version. This ensures compatibility and access to the latest features. The date provided should be the date on which your schema was first created or the most recent update. It's best practice to keep this value current with the API version date.
- **`useCdn`:** Set to `true` in production to leverage Sanity's Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster data delivery.

**Environment Variables:**

It's a good practice to store sensitive information like your project ID and token in environment variables. This keeps your credentials secure and separate from your code.

1.  Create a `.env.development` file (for local development) and a `.env.production` file (for production). Make sure to add `.env.development` and `.env.production` to your `.gitignore` file.

2.  In your `.env.development` (and `.env.production`) file, add the following:

    ```
    SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    SANITY_DATASET=production
    SANITY_TOKEN=your_sanity_token
    ```

3.  Install `dotenv` package to load environment variables in your local environment.

    ```plaintext
    npm install dotenv
    ```

4.  At the beginning of the `gatsby-config.js` add the following line:
    ```plaintext
    require('dotenv').config({
      path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`,
    })
    ```

## Step 3: Querying Data with GraphQL

Gatsby uses GraphQL to fetch data from the data layer created by plugins like `gatsby-source-sanity`. After configuring the plugin and starting the Gatsby development server (`gatsby develop`), you can use Gatsby's built-in GraphQL explorer at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` to explore your Sanity data and construct your queries.

**Example: Querying All Blog Posts**

Let's say you have a "post" schema in Sanity with fields like `title`, `slug`, `body`, and `publishedAt`. Here's a GraphQL query to fetch all blog posts:

```plaintext
query {
  allSanityPost {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        slug {
          current
        }
        bodyRaw
        publishedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **`allSanityPost`:** This is the query to retrieve all documents of type "post" in your Sanity dataset. The `Sanity` prefix is added automatically by the plugin.
- **`edges`:** This is a standard GraphQL pattern for paginated data.
- **`node`:** Represents a single "post" document.
- **`id`:** The unique ID of the document.
- **`title`:** The title of the blog post.
- **`slug.current`:** The URL-friendly identifier for the post, used for creating unique routes. Note the nested `slug.current` â€“ Sanity's slug field is an object with a `current` property.
- **`bodyRaw`:** The content of the blog post. The "Raw" suffix indicates that the field returns the data in its raw, structured form (Portable Text) for maximum flexibility.
- **`publishedAt`:** The date and time the post was published.

## Step 4: Displaying Data in Your Gatsby Components

Now that you have your GraphQL query, you can use it within your Gatsby components using the `useStaticQuery` or `graphql` hook.

**Example: Displaying a List of Blog Posts on the Homepage (`src/pages/index.js`)**

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql, Link, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'

const IndexPage = () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      allSanityPost(sort: { publishedAt: DESC }) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            slug {
              current
            }
            publishedAt(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  const posts = data.allSanityPost.edges

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Latest Blog Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(({ node }) => (
          <li key={node.id}>
            <Link to={`/blog/${node.slug.current}`}>
              <h2>{node.title}</h2>
            </Link>
            <p>Published: {node.publishedAt}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
```

**Explanation:**

- **`useStaticQuery`:** A hook for running GraphQL queries in functional components. It's best for queries that don't depend on component props (like fetching all blog posts).
- **`graphql`:** A template literal used to define your GraphQL query.
- **`data.allSanityPost.edges`:** Accesses the data returned by the query.
- **`posts.map`:** Iterates over the array of blog posts.
- **`Link`:** Gatsby's component for creating internal links. We create a link to each blog post based on its slug.
- **`node.publishedAt(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")`:** Formats the `publishedAt` date using the `formatString` argument. This is a feature provided by the `gatsby-transformer-sharp` which formats dates retrieved from Sanity. Since `gatsby-source-sanity` does not provide `formatString`, you will need to install and configure `gatsby-transformer-sharp` as well if you want to leverage `formatString`. More typically, the dates come through as ISO date strings which you can then transform as necessary.

## Step 5: Creating Dynamic Pages for Blog Posts

You'll need to create dynamic pages for each blog post. Gatsby provides a powerful `gatsby-node.js` file for this purpose. This file lets you define custom page creation logic during the build process.

**Create `gatsby-node.js`**

If you don't already have a `gatsby-node.js` file in your project root, create one.

**Implement the `createPages` API**

Add the following code to your `gatsby-node.js` file:

```plaintext
// gatsby-node.js
const path = require(`path`)

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions

  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve(`src/templates/blog-post.js`)

  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allSanityPost {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            slug {
              current
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  if (result.errors) {
    throw result.errors
  }

  const posts = result.data.allSanityPost.edges

  posts.forEach((edge) => {
    createPage({
      path: `/blog/${edge.node.slug.current}`,
      component: blogPostTemplate,
      context: {
        id: edge.node.id,
      },
    })
  })
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`createPages`:** A Gatsby API that runs during the build process.
- **`graphql`:** Used to fetch data from your Sanity dataset.
- **`createPage`:** A function provided by Gatsby for creating new pages.
- **`blogPostTemplate`:** The path to the React component that will be used to render each blog post.
- **`path`:** The URL path for the new page (e.g., `/blog/my-first-post`).
- **`context`:** An object that will be available as props to the `blogPostTemplate` component. We pass the `id` of the blog post, which we'll use to fetch the full post data within the template.

**Create a Blog Post Template (`src/templates/blog-post.js`)**

Now, create a React component that will be used to render each blog post. This component will receive the `id` from the `context` we defined in `gatsby-node.js` and use it to fetch the full post data.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { PortableText } from '@portabletext/react'

export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: String!) {
    sanityPost(id: { eq: $id }) {
      title
      bodyRaw
      publishedAt(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
    }
  }
`

const BlogPost = ({ data }) => {
  const { title, bodyRaw, publishedAt } = data.sanityPost

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>Published: {publishedAt}</p>
      <PortableText value={bodyRaw} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default BlogPost
```

**Explanation:**

- **`graphql`:** Used to define a GraphQL query that fetches the blog post based on its `id`. The `$id` is a GraphQL variable that's passed from the `context` in `gatsby-node.js`.
- **`data.sanityPost`:** Accesses the data returned by the query.
- **`PortableText`:** A component from `@portabletext/react` to render Portable Text from Sanity. This is the recommended way to handle rich text content from Sanity. **Important**: you will need to install this package with `npm install @portabletext/react`.

## Step 6: Handling Images (Optional)

Sanity.io provides a powerful image API. The `gatsby-source-sanity` plugin exposes image URLs that you can use directly, but for optimal performance and responsive images, you should use Gatsby's image processing capabilities along with the `gatsby-plugin-image` and `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugins.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Plugins:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install gatsby-plugin-image gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-transformer-sharp
    ```

2.  **Configure Plugins:** Add these plugins to your `gatsby-config.js`:

    ```plaintext
    // gatsby-config.js
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-plugin-image`,
        `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
        `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
          options: {
            name: `images`,
            path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
          },
        },
        // Other plugins...
      ],
    }
    ```

3.  **Update Sanity Schema:** In your Sanity schema, add an `image` field to your document type (e.g., "post").

4.  **Query the Image:** Update your GraphQL query to fetch the image data. Assuming you have an image field named `mainImage` in your Sanity schema:

    ```plaintext
    query {
      allSanityPost {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            title
            mainImage {
              asset {
                gatsbyImageData(width: 800, placeholder: BLURRED) # Customize width and placeholder as needed
              }
            }
            slug {
              current
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Use `GatsbyImage` Component:** In your React component, use the `GatsbyImage` component to display the image:

    ```plaintext
    import React from 'react'
    import { GatsbyImage, getImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image'

    const BlogPost = ({ data }) => {
      const { title, mainImage } = data.sanityPost

      const image = getImage(mainImage.asset)

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{title}</h1>
          {image && <GatsbyImage image={image} alt={title} />}
          {/* ... rest of your component */}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

## Step 7: Deploying Your Gatsby Site

Once you're happy with your Gatsby site, you can deploy it to various platforms, such as:

- **Netlify:** A popular platform for deploying static sites with continuous deployment features.
- **Vercel:** Another excellent platform with similar features to Netlify.
- **AWS S3 and CloudFront:** A more manual approach but provides greater control over your infrastructure.
- **GitHub Pages:** A free option for simple static sites.

## Best Practices and Optimization

- **Optimize Images:** Use `gatsby-plugin-image` and `gatsby-transformer-sharp` for responsive images.
- **Cache Queries:** Gatsby automatically caches GraphQL queries, but you can further optimize by using techniques like deferred static generation (DSG) or incremental static regeneration (ISR) if your content updates frequently (available with Gatsby Cloud).
- **Use CDN:** Enable the CDN in your `gatsby-source-sanity` configuration (`useCdn: true` in production).
- **Monitor Performance:** Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
- **Structured Data:** Add structured data (JSON-LD) to your pages to improve SEO. You can use the `gatsby-plugin-schema-snapshot` to generate a schema snapshot for your site.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle potential issues with data fetching or rendering.
- **Content Modeling:** Carefully design your Sanity schema to ensure a good content editing experience and efficient data fetching.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Cannot query field 'allSanity...' on type 'RootQueryType'":** This usually means there's an issue with your `gatsby-source-sanity` configuration. Double-check your `projectId`, `dataset`, and `apiVersion`. Make sure your Sanity project has a schema defined.
- **"Variable '$id' of required type 'String!' was not provided.":** This indicates that the `$id` variable is not being passed correctly in your GraphQL query. Check your `gatsby-node.js` file and ensure that the `context` object is being passed to the `createPage` function.
- **Images not loading:** Verify that you have correctly configured `gatsby-plugin-image`, `gatsby-plugin-sharp`, and `gatsby-transformer-sharp`. Also, double-check your GraphQL query to ensure that you're fetching the image data correctly.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive guide has provided you with the knowledge and steps necessary to fetch data from Sanity.io in your Gatsby projects. By combining the strengths of these two technologies, you can create fast, scalable, and easily maintainable websites. Remember to leverage the GraphQL explorer to understand your data, optimize your images, and carefully design your content models. Happy coding!
