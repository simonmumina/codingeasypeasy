# Mastering Environment Variables in Svelte: Secure, Flexible, and Production-Ready

Managing environment variables is crucial for any modern web application, especially when building with frameworks like Svelte and SvelteKit. Properly handling these variables allows you to:

- **Secure sensitive information:** Avoid committing API keys, database credentials, and other secrets directly to your codebase.
- **Configure for different environments:** Easily switch between development, staging, and production environments without modifying your code.
- **Improve code maintainability:** Centralize configuration settings, making them easier to manage and update.
- **Simplify deployment:** Deploy your application to different environments (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS) without recompiling the code.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the best practices for setting up and using environment variables in your Svelte and SvelteKit projects.

## Why Environment Variables Matter

Imagine you're building a Svelte application that connects to a backend API. The API URL is likely to be different depending on whether you're working locally (development), testing on a staging server, or running in production. Hardcoding these URLs directly into your components is a recipe for disaster. Every time you deploy, you'd need to manually change the code.

Environment variables provide a solution. They allow you to define configuration values outside your codebase and inject them into your application at runtime. This keeps sensitive data safe and enables easy switching between environments.

## Setting Up Environment Variables in SvelteKit

SvelteKit leverages Vite as its build tool, making environment variable handling relatively straightforward. Here's how you can get started:

### 1. Creating `.env` Files

The most common way to define environment variables is using `.env` files. Create a `.env` file in the root of your SvelteKit project. For development purposes, create a `.env.development` file as well. This allows environment-specific variables.

**Example `.env` (root):**

```
PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
```

**Example `.env.development` (root):**

```
PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Never commit your `.env` file to your Git repository!** Add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.
- **Use descriptive names for your variables.** This makes your code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Don't store secrets directly in your public environment variables.** Use the `PUBLIC_` prefix carefully.

### 2. Configuring Vite to Load Environment Variables

SvelteKit uses Vite to handle the build process, so you need to configure Vite to load your `.env` files. Modify your `svelte.config.js` or `vite.config.js` (depending on your SvelteKit version) file. If you only have `svelte.config.js`, it imports your `vite.config.js`, so that's where you will configure. Here's a typical setup:

```plaintext
// vite.config.js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'
import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), '')
  return {
    plugins: [sveltekit()],
    define: {
      __APP_VERSION__: JSON.stringify(process.env.npm_package_version),
      'process.env': env, // This will make *all* env vars available in the browser.  NOT RECOMMENDED for production.
    },
    server: {
      port: 3000,
    },
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), '')`:** This function reads environment variables from `.env` files based on the `mode` (e.g., `development`, `production`). The third argument specifies a prefix for variables that should be exposed to the browser. An empty string exposes _all_ variables to the browser. **This is not recommended for production environments for security reasons.** We'll refine this shortly.
- **`define`:** This allows you to inject global constants into your application during build time. We're defining `__APP_VERSION__` (a common practice) and also attempting to make all env variables available using `process.env`.

**Important Security Note:** The `process.env: env` makes _all_ environment variables available in the browser. This is highly undesirable because it exposes sensitive information to the client-side code. You should be selective about which environment variables are exposed to the browser.

### 3. Exposing Environment Variables to the Browser (Safely!)

SvelteKit provides a safer and more controlled way to expose environment variables to the browser using the `PUBLIC_` prefix. Any environment variable that starts with `PUBLIC_` will automatically be available in your Svelte components.

**Example `.env`:**

```
PRIVATE_API_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY  # Never expose this!
PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com # Safe to expose this
```

With this setup, you **don't** need the `process.env: env` in your `vite.config.js`. SvelteKit automatically handles making variables with `PUBLIC_` available.

### 4. Accessing Environment Variables in Svelte Components

Now that you've configured your environment variables, you can access them in your Svelte components:

```svelte
<script>
  const apiUrl = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL;

  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/data`);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  }

  fetchData();
</script>

<h1>API URL: {apiUrl}</h1>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import.meta.env`:** This object provides access to environment variables that are available to the browser.
- **`PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`:** You can access the value of the `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` variable using its name.

### 5. Environment Variables in Server-Side Code (`+server.js` or `+page.server.js`)

In SvelteKit, you can run code on the server using `+server.js` endpoints or `+page.server.js` for server-side data fetching in your pages. In these files, you can access environment variables directly from `process.env`:

```plaintext
// src/routes/+page.server.js
import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export async function load() {
  const apiKey = process.env.PRIVATE_API_KEY // Available on the server

  // Important: Never send the private key to the client!
  return {
    props: {
      someData: 'Example data',
    },
  }
}

export const GET = async () => {
  const privateApiKey = process.env.PRIVATE_API_KEY

  if (!privateApiKey) {
    console.error('PRIVATE_API_KEY is not defined.')
    return new Response('Internal Server Error', { status: 500 })
  }

  // Use the API key securely here.
  // ...

  return json({ message: 'API call successful' })
}
```

**Important:**

- **`process.env` is only available on the server.** Do not attempt to use it in your client-side Svelte components.
- **Never expose sensitive information from your server-side code to the client.** Only pass necessary data to the client.

### 6. Setting Environment Variables in Production

When deploying your SvelteKit application to a production environment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS), you'll need to set the environment variables in your hosting platform's settings.

**Common Deployment Platforms:**

- **Netlify:** Go to your site settings, then "Build & deploy" -> "Environment".
- **Vercel:** Go to your project settings, then "Environment Variables".
- **AWS (e.g., Lambda):** Configure environment variables within your Lambda function's settings.

**Best Practices for Production Environment Variables:**

- **Use the platform's built-in environment variable management features.** This is the most secure and reliable way to manage production variables.
- **Avoid hardcoding environment variables in your deployment scripts.** This is less secure and makes it harder to update variables.
- **Use different environment variables for each environment (development, staging, production).** This ensures that your application is configured correctly in each environment.

## Example: Using an API Key

Let's illustrate how to use an API key safely in your SvelteKit application.

**1. `.env`:**

```
PRIVATE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
PUBLIC_APP_NAME=My Awesome App
```

**2. `vite.config.js`:** (No changes needed, SvelteKit handles `PUBLIC_` automatically)

**3. `src/routes/+page.server.js`:**

```plaintext
// src/routes/+page.server.js
import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export async function load() {
  const appName = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_APP_NAME // available via load also.

  return {
    props: {
      appName,
    },
  }
}

export const GET = async () => {
  const privateApiKey = process.env.PRIVATE_API_KEY

  if (!privateApiKey) {
    console.error('PRIVATE_API_KEY is not defined.')
    return new Response('Internal Server Error', { status: 500 })
  }

  // Simulate an API call (replace with your actual API call)
  const data = {
    message: 'API call successful',
    apiKeyStatus: 'Key is defined!', // For demonstration
  }

  return json(data)
}
```

**4. `src/routes/+page.svelte`:**

```svelte
<script>
  export let data;
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';

	let apiData;

	onMount(async () => {
		const response = await fetch('/?__data=routes'); // Fetch from our endpoint
		apiData = await response.json();
	});

</script>

<h1>App Name: {data.appName}</h1>

{#if apiData}
	<p>{apiData.message}</p>
	<p>{apiData.apiKeyStatus}</p>
{:else}
	<p>Loading API Data...</p>
{/if}
```

In this example:

- `PRIVATE_API_KEY` is only accessed on the server in `+server.js`. It's used to make the API call.
- `PUBLIC_APP_NAME` is exposed to the browser and used in the Svelte component.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Using the `dotenv` Package Directly

While Vite's built-in environment variable handling is sufficient for most cases, you can also use the `dotenv` package directly for more control. This is especially useful if you need to load environment variables outside of the Vite build process.

```plaintext
npm install dotenv
```

Then, in your server-side code (e.g., `+server.js`):

```plaintext
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config() // Load environment variables from .env

export const GET = async () => {
  const privateApiKey = process.env.PRIVATE_API_KEY
  // ... rest of your code
}
```

**Note:** When using `dotenv` directly, you still need to configure Vite to expose environment variables to the browser using the `PUBLIC_` prefix.

### 2. Validating Environment Variables

It's good practice to validate that required environment variables are set before your application starts. You can do this in your `svelte.config.js` or in a separate initialization script.

```plaintext
// Example validation function
function validateEnv() {
  if (!process.env.PRIVATE_API_KEY) {
    throw new Error('PRIVATE_API_KEY is not defined in the environment.')
  }
  // Add more validations as needed
}

// Call validation during build
validateEnv()

// in vite.config.js (within defineConfig)
export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  validateEnv() // Can also validate inside defineConfig
  // ... rest of config
})
```

This will throw an error during build time or server startup if any required environment variables are missing.

### 3. Using `cross-env` for Cross-Platform Compatibility

If you're working on a cross-platform project (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), you might encounter issues with setting environment variables in your development environment. The `cross-env` package provides a consistent way to set environment variables across different platforms.

```plaintext
npm install cross-env --save-dev
```

Then, you can update your `package.json` scripts to use `cross-env`:

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development vite dev",
    "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
