# Interactive Rebase in Git: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Git interactive rebase is a powerful tool that allows you to rewrite your commit history. It's particularly useful for cleaning up messy commit histories, combining related commits, or fixing mistakes you've made along the way. While it sounds intimidating, understanding the basics of interactive rebase can greatly improve your workflow and the clarity of your projects.

This guide will walk you through the process of performing an interactive rebase, covering the key commands and use cases with clear examples. We'll focus on common scenarios like squashing commits, rewording commit messages, editing commit content, and dropping unwanted commits.

## What is Interactive Rebase?

In essence, interactive rebase allows you to choose which commits you want to keep, modify, or remove when moving commits to a new base. This "base" is usually another branch or a specific commit. The "interactive" part comes from the fact that Git presents you with a list of commits and lets you decide what to do with each one. This is in contrast to a standard rebase, which automatically reapplies all commits.

**Important Note: Rebase is a history-rewriting operation. While incredibly useful, it's crucial to understand its implications, especially when working collaboratively. Avoid rebasing commits that have already been pushed to a shared remote branch, as this can cause significant issues for your collaborators. Only rebase commits that are local to your feature branch.**

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have the following:

- **Git installed:** If you don't have Git installed, download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- **A Git repository:** You should have a Git repository with some commits that you want to rebase. If you don't, create one and add a few commits.

## Basic Usage: Initiating an Interactive Rebase

The command to start an interactive rebase is:

```plaintext
git rebase -i <base>
```

Where `<base>` specifies the commit to which you want to rebase your commits. This can be a branch name, a commit hash, or even a relative reference like `HEAD~3` (meaning the third commit before the current HEAD).

**Example:**

Let's say you're working on a feature branch called `my-feature-branch` and want to rebase it onto the `main` branch. You would run:

```plaintext
git rebase -i main
```

This tells Git to rebase all the commits on `my-feature-branch` (that aren't already on `main`) onto the tip of `main`, and to do so interactively.

## The Interactive Rebase Editor

After running the `git rebase -i` command, Git will open your configured text editor (usually Vim or Nano) with a list of commits. This list looks something like this:

```
pick e7b92a1 Add feature X
pick 8f2c5d4 Fix bug in feature X
pick 3a1e7f6 Implement feature Y
pick c5d84b2 Update documentation

# Rebase a1b2c3d..c5d84b2 onto a1b2c3d (4 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with --continue)
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> = run merge/cherry-pick using specified commit(s)
# .
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
#       However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
```

**Understanding the Editor**

- **Commit List:** The lines starting with `pick` represent the commits that will be rebased. The commits are listed in the order they will be applied.
- **Commands:** The lines below the commit list explain the available commands that you can use to manipulate each commit.
- **Comments:** Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored by Git. They provide useful instructions.

## Core Interactive Rebase Commands

Here's a breakdown of the most commonly used interactive rebase commands:

- **`pick` (or `p`):** Use the commit as is. This is the default action.

  ```
  pick e7b92a1 Add feature X
  ```

- **`reword` (or `r`):** Use the commit, but allow you to edit the commit message.

  ```
  reword 8f2c5d4 Fix bug in feature X
  ```

- **`edit` (or `e`):** Use the commit, but stop the rebase process and allow you to amend the commit (e.g., add or remove files, modify code). After amending, you'll need to run `git rebase --continue`.

  ```
  edit 3a1e7f6 Implement feature Y
  ```

- **`squash` (or `s`):** Use the commit, but merge its changes into the _previous_ commit. You'll be prompted to edit the commit message of the resulting squashed commit.

  ```
  squash c5d84b2 Update documentation
  ```

- **`fixup` (or `f`):** Like `squash`, but discards the commit message of the commit being squashed. The changes are merged into the previous commit with the previous commit's message. Useful for small, inconsequential fixes.

  ```
  fixup 8f2c5d4 Fix bug in feature X
  ```

- **`drop` (or `d`):** Remove the commit from the rebase. Effectively, this deletes the commit from your history.

  ```
  drop e7b92a1 Add feature X
  ```

## Practical Examples

Let's walk through some common interactive rebase scenarios.

**1. Squashing Commits**

Imagine you have the following commit history:

```
feat: Implement initial feature
fix:  typo in feature
docs: updated documentation for the feature
```

You might want to squash these commits into a single, clean commit representing the entire feature. To do this, run `git rebase -i HEAD~3`. Your editor will open with something like:

```
pick a1b2c3d feat: Implement initial feature
pick b2c3d4e fix:  typo in feature
pick c3d4e5f docs: updated documentation for the feature
```

Change the file to:

```
pick a1b2c3d feat: Implement initial feature
squash b2c3d4e fix:  typo in feature
squash c3d4e5f docs: updated documentation for the feature
```

Save and close the editor. Git will now combine the last two commits into the first. It will then open another editor window where you can edit the commit message for the combined commit. You might change it to something like:

```
feat: Implement initial feature and documentation
```

Save and close the editor. Your history now looks like:

```
feat: Implement initial feature and documentation
```

**2. Rewording Commit Messages**

Sometimes, you might realize a commit message isn't as clear as it could be. Use `reword` to change it. For example:

```
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

Editor:

```
pick d4e5f6g Added some stuff
pick e5f6g7h Fixed things
```

Change to:

```
reword d4e5f6g Added some stuff
pick e5f6g7h Fixed things
```

Save and close. Git will now open an editor allowing you to change the commit message for `d4e5f6g`. After you save the new message, the rebase will continue.

**3. Editing Commit Content**

Let's say you committed a file to the wrong place or made a mistake in a previous commit. Use `edit` to amend the commit.

```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

Editor:

```
pick f6g7h8i Initial commit
pick g7h8i9j Added a file
pick h8i9j0k More changes
```

Change to:

```
pick f6g7h8i Initial commit
edit g7h8i9j Added a file
pick h8i9j0k More changes
```

Save and close. Git will stop at commit `g7h8i9j`. Now, you can use standard Git commands to amend the commit:

```plaintext
# Make your changes (e.g., move the file to the correct location)
git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit # Keep the original commit message
git rebase --continue
```

**4. Dropping Unwanted Commits**

Sometimes you might have commits that you simply don't want in your history anymore (e.g., debugging commits, accidental commits). Use `drop` to remove them.

```
git rebase -i HEAD~4
```

Editor:

```
pick i9j0k1l Initial commit
pick j0k1l2m Added a feature
pick k1l2m3n Debug commit (remove me!)
pick l2m3n4o More features
```

Change to:

```
pick i9j0k1l Initial commit
pick j0k1l2m Added a feature
drop k1l2m3n Debug commit (remove me!)
pick l2m3n4o More features
```

Save and close. The `Debug commit` will be completely removed from your history.

## Resolving Conflicts

Interactive rebase can sometimes lead to conflicts, especially if you're rebasing onto a branch with significant changes. If a conflict occurs, Git will pause the rebase and display a message indicating which files have conflicts.

To resolve conflicts:

1.  **Identify the conflicting files:** Git will mark conflicting sections in the affected files with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers.
2.  **Edit the conflicting files:** Manually resolve the conflicts by choosing which changes to keep and removing the conflict markers.
3.  **Stage the resolved files:** `git add <resolved_file>`
4.  **Continue the rebase:** `git rebase --continue`

## Aborting the Rebase

If you encounter problems during the rebase that you can't resolve, or if you simply want to cancel the rebase, you can abort it with:

```plaintext
git rebase --abort
```

This will return your branch to its state before you started the rebase.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Don't rebase public history:** As mentioned earlier, avoid rebasing commits that have already been pushed to a shared remote branch. This can create significant issues for your collaborators.
- **Keep commits small and focused:** Smaller, well-defined commits make rebasing easier and less prone to conflicts.
- **Test your changes:** After rebasing, thoroughly test your changes to ensure everything is working as expected.
- **Backup your branch:** Before performing a potentially destructive operation like interactive rebase, consider creating a backup branch: `git checkout -b backup-branch`
- **Be mindful of commit order:** The order of commits in the rebase editor matters. Commits are applied from top to bottom. Changing the order can have unexpected consequences.
- **Read the editor instructions:** The comments in the rebase editor contain valuable information and instructions.

## Conclusion

Git interactive rebase is a powerful tool for managing and cleaning up your commit history. By mastering the commands and understanding the potential pitfalls, you can significantly improve your workflow and the clarity of your projects. Remember to practice on a test branch before using it on important work, and always be mindful of the impact of rewriting history, especially in collaborative environments.
