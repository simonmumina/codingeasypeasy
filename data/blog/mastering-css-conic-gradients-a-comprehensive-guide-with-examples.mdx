# Mastering CSS Conic Gradients: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

CSS gradients are powerful tools for adding visual flair and depth to your web designs. While linear and radial gradients are well-established, conic gradients offer a unique way to create stunning effects like pie charts, color wheels, and intricate patterns. This comprehensive guide dives deep into the world of `conic-gradient()`, equipping you with the knowledge and practical examples to master this versatile CSS function.

## What is a CSS Conic Gradient?

Unlike linear gradients that transition colors along a line or radial gradients that emanate from a center point, a conic gradient transitions colors around a center point, resembling a cone or a slice of pie. This distinctive characteristic opens up a world of creative possibilities for web developers.

## Basic Syntax of `conic-gradient()`

The basic syntax of the `conic-gradient()` function is as follows:

```plaintext
background: conic-gradient([from <angle>]? [at <position>]?, <color-stop-list>);
```

Let's break down each component:

- **`background: conic-gradient()`**: This declares a `background` property with the value of the `conic-gradient()` function.
- **`[from <angle>]?`**: This is an optional parameter that specifies the starting angle of the gradient in degrees, turns, or radians. The default value is `0deg`, which starts the gradient at the top (12 o'clock position).
- **`[at <position>]?`**: This optional parameter defines the center position of the gradient. It accepts keywords like `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `center`, or percentage values. The default value is `center center`.
- **`<color-stop-list>`**: This is a comma-separated list of color stops. Each color stop consists of a color value and an optional position (percentage or length) indicating where that color should begin.

## Simple Conic Gradient Examples

Let's start with a few basic examples to illustrate the fundamental principles of `conic-gradient()`.

**Example 1: A Basic Two-Color Conic Gradient**

```plaintext
.conic-gradient-1 {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: conic-gradient(red, blue);
}
```

This code creates a square element with a conic gradient that transitions smoothly from red to blue. The gradient starts at 0 degrees (top) and rotates clockwise.

**Example 2: Specifying Color Stop Positions**

```plaintext
.conic-gradient-2 {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: conic-gradient(red 25%, blue 75%, green 100%);
}
```

In this example, we explicitly define the positions of each color stop. The gradient is red from 0% to 25%, blue from 25% to 75%, and green from 75% to 100%. This allows for more precise control over the color distribution.

**Example 3: Changing the Starting Angle**

```plaintext
.conic-gradient-3 {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: conic-gradient(from 45deg, red, blue);
}
```

This example starts the gradient at a 45-degree angle, effectively rotating the entire gradient clockwise by 45 degrees.

**Example 4: Adjusting the Center Position**

```plaintext
.conic-gradient-4 {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: conic-gradient(at top left, red, blue);
}
```

Here, we position the center of the gradient at the top-left corner of the element.

## Advanced Conic Gradient Techniques

Now that we've covered the basics, let's explore some more advanced techniques to create compelling visual effects with `conic-gradient()`.

**1. Creating a Pie Chart**

Conic gradients are perfect for creating pie charts without relying on JavaScript libraries or complex SVG implementations.

```plaintext
.pie-chart {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 50%; /* Make it circular */
  background: conic-gradient(
    red 40%,
    green 30%,
    blue 30%
  );
}
```

This code generates a pie chart with three segments: red (40%), green (30%), and blue (30%). Note the use of `border-radius: 50%;` to create a circular shape.

**2. Creating a Color Wheel**

A color wheel can be easily constructed using `conic-gradient()` and a range of vibrant colors.

```plaintext
.color-wheel {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: conic-gradient(
    hsl(0, 100%, 50%),    /* Red */
    hsl(60, 100%, 50%),   /* Yellow */
    hsl(120, 100%, 50%),  /* Green */
    hsl(180, 100%, 50%),  /* Cyan */
    hsl(240, 100%, 50%),  /* Blue */
    hsl(300, 100%, 50%),  /* Magenta */
    hsl(360, 100%, 50%)   /* Red (close the loop) */
  );
}
```

This example uses HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values to create a smooth transition through the color spectrum. The hue value is incremented by 60 degrees for each color, resulting in a complete color wheel.

**3. Creating Striped or Patterned Gradients**

By using the same color for consecutive color stops, you can create sharp transitions and generate striped or patterned effects.

```plaintext
.striped-gradient {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: conic-gradient(
    #ccc 0%,
    #ccc 25%,
    #fff 25%,
    #fff 50%,
    #ccc 50%,
    #ccc 75%,
    #fff 75%,
    #fff 100%
  );
}
```

This creates a simple checkered pattern. You can adjust the colors and percentages to customize the pattern to your liking.

**4. Creating Donut Charts**

Donut charts are a variation of pie charts with a hole in the center. You can achieve this by layering a smaller element on top of the conic gradient with a background color that matches the surrounding area.

```plaintext
<div class="donut-chart-container">
  <div class="donut-chart"></div>
  <div class="donut-hole"></div>
</div>
```

```plaintext
.donut-chart-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}

.donut-chart {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: conic-gradient(
    red 60%,
    green 40%
  );
}

.donut-hole {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 50%; /* Adjust the hole size here */
  height: 50%; /* Adjust the hole size here */
  background-color: white; /* Match your background color */
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

This example uses absolute positioning and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%);` to perfectly center the donut hole. Adjust the `width` and `height` of `.donut-hole` to control the size of the central hole. Ensure `background-color` of `.donut-hole` matches the background color of the page or the parent element.

**5. Animating Conic Gradients**

You can animate the `from` angle property to create mesmerizing spinning or rotating effects.

```plaintext
.animated-gradient {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: conic-gradient(red, blue, green);
  animation: rotate 5s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes rotate {
  from {
    background-position: 0;
    background-size: 200% 200%;
    background-image: conic-gradient(from 0deg, red, blue, green);
  }
  to {
    background-position: 100%;
    background-size: 200% 200%;
    background-image: conic-gradient(from 360deg, red, blue, green);
  }
}
```

This code animates the `from` angle from 0 degrees to 360 degrees, creating a continuous spinning effect.

## Browser Compatibility

While `conic-gradient()` is widely supported in modern browsers, it's essential to check compatibility before using it in production environments. Refer to [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/?search=conic-gradient) for the latest browser support information. You may need to use vendor prefixes for older browsers. However, this is becoming increasingly rare.

## Accessibility Considerations

When using conic gradients, consider the following accessibility guidelines:

- **Ensure sufficient contrast:** Make sure that the colors used in the gradient provide sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments. Use contrast checking tools to verify compliance.
- **Provide alternative text:** If the gradient conveys important information, provide alternative text (e.g., using the `alt` attribute for images or ARIA attributes for other elements) to ensure that screen reader users can access the information.
- **Avoid relying solely on color:** Do not rely solely on color to convey meaning. Use additional visual cues, such as labels or icons, to ensure that the information is accessible to users who are colorblind.
