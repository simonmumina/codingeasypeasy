# How to Run Python in WSL: A Comprehensive Guide for Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) provides a powerful and convenient way to run Linux distributions directly on your Windows machine. This allows developers to leverage the strengths of both operating systems, using Windows for their desktop environment and Linux for development workflows that often benefit from a Linux-based system. Python development is a prime example of this synergy. This guide will walk you through setting up WSL and installing Python, ensuring you have a robust and efficient development environment.

## What is Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)?

WSL enables you to run a Linux environment—including command-line tools, utilities, and applications—directly on Windows, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup. There are two main versions:

- **WSL 1:** Translates Linux system calls to Windows system calls. Faster initial boot-up but can be slower on file system operations.
- **WSL 2:** Runs a full Linux kernel in a lightweight virtual machine. Offers significant performance improvements, especially for file I/O, making it ideal for development tasks like Python.

This guide focuses on **WSL 2** due to its superior performance.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Windows 10 version 1903 or higher** (Build 18362 or later) or **Windows 11**.
- A basic understanding of command-line interfaces (CLI).

## Step 1: Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux

First, we need to enable WSL on your Windows machine.

1.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator:** Search for "PowerShell" in the Start Menu, right-click, and select "Run as administrator."

2.  **Enable WSL Feature:** Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    ```

3.  **Enable Virtual Machine Platform Feature:** Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    ```

4.  **Restart your computer.**

## Step 2: Download and Install a Linux Distribution

Now, we need to install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. Popular choices include:

- **Ubuntu:** Widely used and well-supported. A great choice for beginners.
- **Debian:** Stable and reliable, often preferred by experienced users.
- **Kali Linux:** For penetration testing and security audits (if that's your field).
- **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server:** A robust server distribution.

For this guide, we will use **Ubuntu**.

1.  **Open the Microsoft Store:** Search for "Microsoft Store" in the Start Menu and open it.

2.  **Search for Ubuntu:** Type "Ubuntu" in the search bar and select the latest LTS version (e.g., "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS").

3.  **Install Ubuntu:** Click the "Get" button to download and install Ubuntu.

## Step 3: Set up your Linux Distribution

After the installation is complete, launch the Ubuntu application from the Start Menu. The first time you run it, it will take a few minutes to initialize the environment. You will then be prompted to create a username and password for your Linux user.

1.  **Launch Ubuntu:** Find "Ubuntu" in your Start Menu and click to launch it.

2.  **Create a user:** Follow the prompts to create a username and password. Remember these credentials – they will be your Linux user credentials within WSL.

## Step 4: Update and Upgrade Packages

Once you have your user set up, it's a good practice to update and upgrade the existing packages.

1.  **Open the Ubuntu terminal:** Launch Ubuntu again if it's not already running.

2.  **Update the package list:** Run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    ```

3.  **Upgrade the installed packages:** Run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

    You might be prompted to confirm the upgrade by typing `y` and pressing Enter.

## Step 5: Install Python

Now for the main event: installing Python! Ubuntu often comes with Python pre-installed, but it's usually an older version. We'll install the latest stable version using `apt`.

1.  **Check for existing Python versions:** You can check if Python is already installed by running:

    ```plaintext
    python3 --version
    ```

    If you see a version number, Python is installed. If not, or if you want a specific version, proceed to the next step.

2.  **Install Python 3:** Run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install python3
    ```

3.  **Install `pip` (Python Package Installer):** `pip` is essential for installing and managing Python packages.

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```

4.  **Verify the installation:** Check the Python and `pip` versions:

    ```plaintext
    python3 --version
    pip3 --version
    ```

    You should see the installed versions printed to the terminal.

## Step 6: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Using virtual environments is a best practice for Python development. They allow you to isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects.

1.  **Install `venv`:** `venv` is the standard library module for creating virtual environments.

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:** Navigate to your project directory (or create one) and run the following command to create a virtual environment named `.venv`:

    ```plaintext
    mkdir myproject
    cd myproject
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    ```plaintext
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(.venv)`, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

4.  **Install packages within the virtual environment:** Use `pip` to install the packages you need for your project. For example, to install the `requests` library:

    ```plaintext
    pip install requests
    ```

5.  **Deactivate the virtual environment:** When you're finished working on the project, deactivate the environment:

    ```plaintext
    deactivate
    ```

    The `(.venv)` prefix will disappear from your terminal prompt.

## Example: Running a Simple Python Script

Let's create a simple Python script to test our setup.

1.  **Create a file named `hello.py`:** You can use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` from the command line, or your favorite code editor if you have it set up to access WSL files (see below).

    ```plaintext
    nano hello.py
    ```

2.  **Add the following code to `hello.py`:**

    ```plaintext
    import requests

    def get_ip_address():
        try:
            response = requests.get("https://api.ipify.org?format=json")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            data = response.json()
            return data['ip']
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error fetching IP address: {e}")
            return None

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        ip_address = get_ip_address()
        if ip_address:
            print(f"Your public IP address is: {ip_address}")
        else:
            print("Could not retrieve IP address.")
    ```

3.  **Save the file:** In `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4.  **Run the script:**

    ```plaintext
    python3 hello.py
    ```

    If you have an active internet connection, the script will print your public IP address. This confirms that Python is installed correctly and can access external resources. If you get an error saying the `requests` module is not found, make sure you have activated your virtual environment (if you created one) and installed the `requests` package using `pip install requests`.

## Accessing WSL Files from Windows

You can access your WSL files directly from Windows Explorer. In Windows Explorer, type `\\wsl$` in the address bar and press Enter. You will see a list of your installed distributions. Click on the distribution you want to access (e.g., Ubuntu) to browse its file system. This is very useful for editing files with Windows-based code editors.

## Integrating with Windows-based Code Editors (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) offers excellent integration with WSL, allowing you to develop directly within the Linux environment while leveraging VS Code's powerful features.

1.  **Install the "Remote - WSL" extension:** Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for "Remote - WSL", and install the extension.

2.  **Open your project in WSL:** From within your WSL terminal, navigate to your project directory (e.g., `~/myproject`) and run:

    ```plaintext
    code .
    ```

    This will open VS Code in a "Remote - WSL" window, connected to your Linux environment.

VS Code will automatically install necessary components within WSL the first time you connect. This setup allows VS Code to run extensions and perform tasks directly within the Linux environment, providing a seamless development experience. You can now edit, debug, and run your Python code using VS Code within WSL.

## Managing Python Versions with `pyenv` (Optional)

If you need to work with multiple Python versions, `pyenv` is a powerful tool for managing them.

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl git
    ```

2.  **Install `pyenv`:**

    ```plaintext
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```

    This will download and run the `pyenv` installer. Follow the on-screen instructions, which will typically involve adding `pyenv` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

    - **Bash (`.bashrc`):** Add the following lines to `~/.bashrc`:

      ```plaintext
      export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
      command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
      eval "$(pyenv init -)"
      eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
      ```

    - **Zsh (`.zshrc`):** Add the following lines to `~/.zshrc`:

      ```plaintext
      export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
      command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
      eval "$(pyenv init -)"
      eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
      ```

3.  **Reload your shell:**

    ```plaintext
    source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
    ```

4.  **Install a Python version:**

    ```plaintext
    pyenv install 3.9.18  # Replace with your desired version
    ```

5.  **Set the global Python version:**

    ```plaintext
    pyenv global 3.9.18  # Replace with your desired version
    ```

6.  **Create a virtual environment (using pyenv's virtualenv plugin):**

    ```plaintext
    pyenv virtualenv 3.9.18 myproject-env
    pyenv activate myproject-env
    ```

`pyenv` gives you fine-grained control over your Python installations and virtual environments, especially if you're juggling multiple projects with different Python version requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Command not found" errors:** Ensure that the necessary packages (like `python3-pip`) are installed. Also, double-check that your virtual environment is activated if you are working within one. If you have installed `pyenv`, make sure it's properly configured in your shell configuration file.

- **Permission issues:** Use `sudo` when installing packages or performing operations that require elevated privileges.

- **Slow performance:** WSL 2 offers significantly better performance than WSL 1. Make sure you are using WSL 2. You can check the version of your distribution with `wsl -l -v` and convert it to WSL 2 using `wsl --set-version <DistributionName> 2`.

## Conclusion

Running Python in WSL provides a powerful and flexible development environment, combining the familiarity of Windows with the robust tools and utilities of Linux. By following this guide, you should now have a fully functional Python environment set up in WSL, ready for your next project. Remember to utilize virtual environments for dependency management and consider using VS Code for a seamless development experience. Happy coding!
