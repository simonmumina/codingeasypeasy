# @container CSS: Mastering Responsive Design with Container Queries

Responsive design is a cornerstone of modern web development. Traditionally, we've relied heavily on media queries, which target the viewport size to adjust styles. However, media queries can fall short when we need components to adapt based on the size of their _containing element_, rather than the overall screen size. Enter **container queries**, powered by the `@container` CSS at-rule!

This blog post will guide you through the world of container queries, showing you how to leverage them to create truly flexible and reusable components. We'll explore the syntax, dive into practical examples, and discuss best practices for incorporating container queries into your projects.

## The Problem with Media Queries: Viewport vs. Container

Media queries are fantastic for adapting your layout across different devices and screen sizes. But consider this scenario: you have a card component that needs to behave differently depending on where it's placed within your layout.

- **Scenario 1:** The card is placed in a narrow sidebar.
- **Scenario 2:** The card is placed in a wide main content area.

Using media queries alone, you'd struggle to make the card automatically adapt to the available space in _each_ of these contexts. Media queries only know about the viewport width (or height). They don't inherently know about the size of the card's parent container.

## Container Queries to the Rescue

Container queries solve this problem beautifully. They allow you to apply styles based on the _size or style_ of a specific ancestor element (the "container"). This means your components become truly context-aware.

## Defining a Container

Before you can use `@container`, you need to designate a containing element using the `container-type` and `container-name` properties.

- **`container-type`**: Specifies the type of containment context to establish. There are three main options:
  - `size`: Creates a containment context based on the width and height of the container.
  - `inline-size`: Creates a containment context based only on the inline size (usually the width) of the container. This is generally the most commonly used value.
  - `normal`: Doesn't create a containment context, meaning the element is not a container. This is the default value.
- **`container-name`**: (Optional) Assigns a name to the container. This allows you to target specific containers if you have multiple containers in your hierarchy.

Let's look at an example:

```plaintext
/* Designates the element with the class 'card-container' as a size container */
.card-container {
  container-type: size;
}

/* Designates the element with the ID 'main-content' as an inline-size container and names it 'main' */
#main-content {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: main;
}
```

**Shorthand Property: `container`**

You can combine `container-type` and `container-name` into a single shorthand property: `container`.

```plaintext
/* Equivalent to container-type: size; */
.card-container {
  container: size;
}

/* Equivalent to container-type: inline-size; container-name: main; */
#main-content {
  container: main / inline-size; /* order matters: name / type */
}
```

## Using the `@container` At-Rule

Now that you have a container defined, you can use the `@container` at-rule to apply styles based on its size. The syntax is similar to media queries:

```plaintext
@container <container-name> ( <condition> ) {
  /* Styles to apply when the condition is met */
}
```

- `<container-name>`: (Optional) The name of the container. If omitted, the styles apply based on the nearest ancestor container.
- `<condition>`: A condition based on the container's size. This can include:
  - `min-width`: Minimum width of the container.
  - `max-width`: Maximum width of the container.
  - `min-height`: Minimum height of the container.
  - `max-height`: Maximum height of the container.
  - `width > <value>` , `width < <value>` , etc. More flexible comparisons.

Here's an example demonstrating how to adjust the layout of our card component based on the container's width:

```plaintext
.card-container {
  container: card-area / inline-size; /* Define the container */
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 16px;
}

.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
}

.card img {
  max-width: 100%;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card h2 {
  font-size: 1.2em;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

/* Container query:  When the container 'card-area' is at least 300px wide... */
@container card-area (min-width: 300px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: row; /* Change to row layout */
    align-items: flex-start;
    text-align: left;
  }

  .card img {
    max-width: 150px;
    margin-right: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 0;
  }

  .card h2 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
}
```

In this example, the card will initially be displayed as a column with centered content. However, when the `.card-container` (named `card-area`) reaches a width of 300px or more, the layout changes to a row, aligning the image and text side-by-side.

## Practical Examples and Use Cases

Container queries unlock a wide range of possibilities for creating adaptable components. Here are a few practical examples:

- **Navigation Menus:** Change the navigation menu from a full-width layout to a compact dropdown when placed in a narrower container.
- **Data Tables:** Adjust column visibility and layout within a table based on the available space.
- **Product Listings:** Modify the arrangement of product images and details based on the grid size.
- **Article Summaries:** Alter the length of article summaries to fit within different content areas.

## Advanced Techniques

### Using Multiple Conditions

You can combine multiple conditions within the `@container` at-rule using logical operators like `and` and `or`:

```plaintext
@container (min-width: 300px) and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Styles apply when the container is between 300px and 600px wide */
}

@container (min-width: 400px) or (min-height: 300px) {
  /* Styles apply when the container is at least 400px wide OR at least 300px tall */
}
```

### Styling Based on Container Styles (Experimental)

While not yet widely supported, the CSS Containment Module Level 3 specification introduces the ability to style elements based on the _styles_ applied to their container. This opens up even more advanced possibilities for adaptive design. However, support is still limited, so use with caution.

### Nested Containers

Container queries can be nested, allowing for complex and granular control over component styling. Just remember that each nested container must be explicitly defined with `container-type`.

## Best Practices

- **Choose the Right `container-type`:** Use `inline-size` for most width-based adaptations. `size` is necessary if you need to adapt based on both width _and_ height. `normal` is the default and effectively disables containment for that element.
- **Use `container-name` for Clarity:** When you have multiple potential containers, assigning names makes your code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Start Small:** Begin by applying container queries to individual components and gradually expand their usage.
- **Consider Performance:** While generally performant, excessive use of complex container queries can potentially impact rendering speed. Test and optimize as needed.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that your responsive designs remain accessible to all users, regardless of container size.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Use container queries as a progressive enhancement. Ensure your website is functional and usable even if container queries are not supported by the browser. This could involve using default styles or media query fallbacks.

## Browser Support

Browser support for container queries is excellent in modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. You can check the latest compatibility information on websites like [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/).

## Conclusion

Container queries represent a significant advancement in responsive design, enabling you to create truly flexible and adaptable web components. By mastering the `@container` at-rule and understanding its capabilities, you can build more robust and maintainable websites that provide an optimal user experience across various contexts.
