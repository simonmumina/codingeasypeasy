# Detecting Route Changes in Svelte: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Svelte and its more robust cousin, SvelteKit, provide powerful mechanisms for building dynamic and interactive web applications.  One common requirement in web development is the ability to detect when the user navigates to a different route within your application. Knowing when a route change occurs allows you to perform actions such as:

*   Updating the UI based on the new route.
*   Fetching data relevant to the new page.
*   Logging analytics events.
*   Showing loading indicators.
*   Cancelling in-flight API requests from the previous page.

This blog post will explore several methods for detecting route changes in Svelte and SvelteKit, complete with detailed explanations and practical code examples.

## Understanding SvelteKit's Routing

Before diving into the detection techniques, it's crucial to understand how SvelteKit handles routing. SvelteKit uses a file-based routing system. Each directory in your `src/routes` folder represents a route segment. For example, a file named `src/routes/about/+page.svelte` creates a route accessible at `/about`.

SvelteKit also provides powerful hooks and APIs for intercepting and modifying the navigation process.  We'll leverage these features to detect route changes effectively.

## Method 1: Using the `beforeNavigate` Hook in SvelteKit

The most common and recommended approach for detecting route changes in SvelteKit is to use the `beforeNavigate` hook. This hook executes **before** a navigation event starts, giving you the opportunity to:

*   Prevent the navigation.
*   Access information about the navigation target.
*   Perform asynchronous operations before the navigation completes.

To use `beforeNavigate`, you need to create a `+layout.svelte` or `+layout.js(+ts)` file in the directory where you want to observe route changes.  This ensures the hook is active for the entire route subtree.

Here's an example:

**src/routes/+layout.svelte:**

```svelte
<script>
  import { beforeNavigate } from '$app/navigation';
  import { page } from '$app/stores';
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  let currentRoute = '';

  beforeNavigate((navigation) => {
    console.log('Navigating from:', $page.url.pathname, 'to:', navigation.to?.pathname);
    currentRoute = navigation.to?.pathname || ''; // Store the new route
    // Example: Save previous route
    // localStorage.setItem('previousRoute', $page.url.pathname);

    // Example: Perform an action before navigating to a specific route
    if (navigation.to?.pathname === '/profile') {
      console.log("About to navigate to the profile page!");
    }
  });

  onMount(() => {
    currentRoute = $page.url.pathname;
  });

  // After the page mounts, set the current route to the initial route
</script>

<div>
  <slot />
</div>

<p>Current Route: {currentRoute}</p>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `beforeNavigate`:**  We import the `beforeNavigate` hook from `$app/navigation`.
2.  **Import `page` store:** We import the `page` store from `$app/stores` to access information about the current route.
3.  **Define a variable `currentRoute`:**  This variable will store the current route. We will use this to show that route changes occur.
4.  **`beforeNavigate` Function:** The `beforeNavigate` function receives a `navigation` object.
    *   `navigation.to`:  Contains information about the target route (if navigating to another page within the app).  It will be `null` for external links or hard refreshes.  The `navigation.to?.pathname` gives the target URL's pathname.
    *   `navigation.from`: (Deprecated, use `$page.url` instead)  Contains information about the route *before* navigation.
    *   `navigation.type`:  Indicates the type of navigation (e.g., `"link"`, `"popstate"`, `"goto"`).
    *   `navigation.willRedirect`:  Indicates whether the navigation will result in a server-side redirect.
5.  **Accessing the Current Route:** We use the `page` store to access the current URL using `$page.url.pathname`.
6.  **Example actions:** The code provides example of actions that you can take such as saving a previous route, or performing actions before navigating to a page.
7. **`onMount` Function:** The `onMount` function is called when the component is first rendered on the client side.  This is necessary to initialize the `currentRoute` variable to the initial route, since `beforeNavigate` is not called on the initial page load.
8. **Display Current Route:** We display the value of `currentRoute` which changes upon navigation.
9.  **`<slot />`:**  The `<slot />` element renders the content of the specific route being visited.

**Key Benefits of `beforeNavigate`:**

*   **Comprehensive Information:**  Provides detailed information about the navigation event.
*   **Control over Navigation:** Allows you to prevent or modify navigation.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Supports performing asynchronous tasks before navigation completes.

## Method 2: Using the `afterNavigate` Hook in SvelteKit

Similar to `beforeNavigate`, the `afterNavigate` hook allows you to perform actions *after* a navigation event has completed.  This is useful for tasks that don't need to block the navigation process, such as logging analytics or updating UI elements based on the new route.

**src/routes/+layout.svelte:**

```svelte
<script>
  import { afterNavigate } from '$app/navigation';
  import { page } from '$app/stores';

  let currentRoute = '';

  afterNavigate(() => {
    console.log('Navigated to:', $page.url.pathname);
    currentRoute = $page.url.pathname;
    // Example: Log an analytics event
    // trackPageView($page.url.pathname);
  });

  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  onMount(() => {
    currentRoute = $page.url.pathname;
  });

</script>

<div>
  <slot />
</div>

<p>Current Route: {currentRoute}</p>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `afterNavigate`:**  We import the `afterNavigate` hook from `$app/navigation`.
2.  **Import `page` store:** We import the `page` store from `$app/stores` to access information about the current route.
3.  **`afterNavigate` Function:** The `afterNavigate` function is called *after* the navigation is complete.  It doesn't receive a `navigation` object, but you can access the current route through the `page` store.
4.  **Accessing the Current Route:**  We access the new URL through the `$page` store.
5.  **Example action:** The code provides an example of an action that you can take such as logging an analytics event.
6. **`onMount` Function:** Same as before, to set the initial route.

**When to use `afterNavigate`:**

*   For tasks that don't need to block navigation.
*   For updating UI elements after the new page has rendered.
*   For logging analytics or other non-critical operations.

## Method 3: Subscribing to the `page` Store

The `$app/stores` module provides the `page` store, which is a Svelte readable store that holds information about the current page, including the URL, parameters, and data. You can subscribe to this store to react to changes in the route.  This approach works in both Svelte and SvelteKit.

**Example:**

```svelte
<script>
  import { page } from '$app/stores';
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  let currentRoute = '';

  $: {
    currentRoute = $page.url.pathname;
    console.log('Page store updated. Current route:', currentRoute);

    // Example: Fetch data based on the route
    // if (currentRoute === '/blog') {
    //   fetchBlogPosts();
    // }
  }
  
  onMount(() => {
    currentRoute = $page.url.pathname;
  });

</script>

<div>
  <slot />
</div>

<p>Current Route: {currentRoute}</p>

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `page` store:**  We import the `page` store from `$app/stores`.
2.  **Reactive Statement `$: { ... }`:**  The `$: { ... }` syntax creates a reactive statement in Svelte. This block of code will execute whenever any of the variables it depends on change. In this case, it depends on the `$page` store, so it will execute whenever the `page` store updates (i.e., on a route change).
3.  **Accessing the Current Route:**  We access the new URL through the `$page` store.
4.  **Example action:** The code provides an example of an action that you can take such as fetching data based on the route.
5. **`onMount` Function:**  Again, to set the initial route.

**When to use the `page` store:**

*   When you need to react to route changes within a specific component.
*   When you need access to the page's parameters or data.
*   In both Svelte and SvelteKit projects.

## Method 4: Creating a Custom Router (Less Common, More Control)

For highly specific scenarios or when you need complete control over routing, you can create a custom router.  This involves using the `history` API and managing the route state manually.  This is generally not recommended unless you have a very compelling reason to bypass SvelteKit's built-in routing.

**Example (Simplified):**

```svelte
<script>
  import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  const currentRoute = writable(window.location.pathname);

  function handleRouteChange() {
    currentRoute.set(window.location.pathname);
  }

  onMount(() => {
    window.addEventListener('popstate', handleRouteChange);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('popstate', handleRouteChange);
    };
  });

  $: console.log('Custom router: Route changed to', $currentRoute);
</script>

<p>Custom Router Current Route: {$currentRoute}</p>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Create a Writable Store:** We create a Svelte writable store (`currentRoute`) to hold the current route.
2.  **`handleRouteChange` Function:** This function updates the `currentRoute` store with the current path from `window.location.pathname`.
3.  **`popstate` Event Listener:**  We attach an event listener to the `popstate` event. This event is fired when the user navigates through the browser's history (e.g., using the back or forward buttons).
4.  **Update the Store:**  The `handleRouteChange` function updates the `currentRoute` store when the `popstate` event is triggered.
5.  **Cleanup:** We return a cleanup function from `onMount` to remove the event listener when the component is unmounted.
6.  **Display the Route:** We display the current route from the `$currentRoute` store.

**Why this method is less common:**

*   **Complexity:**  It's more complex to implement and maintain than using SvelteKit's built-in routing.
*   **Duplication of Functionality:**  You'll need to reimplement features that SvelteKit provides out-of-the-box (e.g., route parameters, layouts, error handling).
*   **Potential for Errors:**  It's easier to introduce bugs and inconsistencies when managing routing manually.

**Use Cases:**

*   Highly customized routing requirements that cannot be met by SvelteKit.
*   Integration with legacy systems that use a different routing mechanism.

## Choosing the Right Method

Here's a summary to help you choose the best approach for detecting route changes in your Svelte and SvelteKit applications:

*   **`beforeNavigate` (SvelteKit):**  Recommended for most scenarios where you need to perform actions *before* navigation, potentially blocking or modifying the navigation.
*   **`afterNavigate` (SvelteKit):**  Ideal for tasks that don't need to block navigation, such as logging analytics or updating UI elements after the new page has rendered.
*   **Subscribing to the `page` store:**  Useful for reacting to route changes within a specific component, and in both Svelte and SvelteKit projects.
*   **Custom Router:**  Only consider this option if you have very specific routing requirements that cannot be met by SvelteKit's built-in routing.

## Conclusion

Detecting route changes is a fundamental task in web development. Svelte and SvelteKit provide several powerful mechanisms to achieve this, offering flexibility and control over the navigation process. By understanding the different methods and their use cases, you can effectively react to route changes in your applications and create a more dynamic and interactive user experience. Remember to choose the approach that best suits your specific needs and project requirements.  Happy coding!
