# Nuxt 2 vs Nuxt 3: Key Differences, Migration Guide, and Performance Comparison

Nuxt.js, a powerful Vue.js framework, simplifies the creation of server-rendered Vue.js applications, static site generation (SSG), and single-page applications (SPAs). For years, Nuxt 2 was the go-to choice. However, Nuxt 3, built on Vue 3, offers significant improvements and a modern approach to web development. This comprehensive guide explores the key differences between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3, providing insights into their features, benefits, and how to migrate your existing Nuxt 2 applications.

## Why Upgrade to Nuxt 3?

Before diving into the specifics, let's address the fundamental question: why consider upgrading to Nuxt 3?

- **Vue 3 Compatibility:** Nuxt 3 leverages the power of Vue 3, which introduces substantial performance enhancements, a smaller bundle size, and the Composition API.

- **Improved Performance:** Thanks to Vue 3 and Vite, Nuxt 3 boasts significant performance improvements, resulting in faster build times, smaller bundle sizes, and a more responsive user experience.

- **Modern Development Experience:** Nuxt 3 offers a more streamlined and modern development experience with features like TypeScript support, native ES Modules, and improved error handling.

- **Future-Proofing Your Application:** Nuxt 2 is nearing its end of life, with ongoing maintenance but less focus on new feature development. Upgrading to Nuxt 3 ensures your application remains up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.

## Key Differences Between Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3

Let's break down the key differences in detail:

### 1. Vue Version

This is the most fundamental difference.

- **Nuxt 2:** Built on Vue 2. Relies on the Options API for component definition.
- **Nuxt 3:** Built on Vue 3. Leverages the Composition API for a more flexible and organized component structure.

**Code Example (Options API - Nuxt 2):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    <button @click="updateMessage">Update Message</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello from Nuxt 2!',
    };
  },
  methods: {
    updateMessage() {
      this.message = 'Message updated!';
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

**Code Example (Composition API - Nuxt 3):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    <button @click="updateMessage">Update Message</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const message = ref('Hello from Nuxt 3!');

const updateMessage = () => {
  message.value = 'Message updated!';
};
</script>
```

The Composition API offers several advantages:

- **Organization:** Logically group related code, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Reusability:** Easily extract and reuse logic across components using composables.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Enhanced TypeScript support for better type safety.

### 2. Build Tool

- **Nuxt 2:** Uses Webpack.
- **Nuxt 3:** Uses Vite, a next-generation build tool that leverages native ES Modules for significantly faster development builds and hot module replacement (HMR).

Vite's speed improvements are noticeable, especially in larger projects. It leverages native ES modules, allowing the browser to handle module resolution during development, resulting in near-instant updates.

### 3. Core Architecture

- **Nuxt 2:** Uses a custom server engine.
- **Nuxt 3:** Uses Nitro, a new server engine designed for universal JavaScript. Nitro simplifies deployment and supports multiple platforms, including serverless environments.

Nitro offers:

- **Serverless Compatibility:** Easily deploy your Nuxt application to serverless platforms like Netlify Functions or Vercel.
- **API Routes:** Create API endpoints directly within your Nuxt application.
- **Middleware:** Implement server-side logic to handle requests and responses.

### 4. TypeScript Support

- **Nuxt 2:** Requires `@nuxt/typescript-build` module for TypeScript support, which adds extra configuration.
- **Nuxt 3:** Has native TypeScript support, making it easier to integrate TypeScript into your project.

Nuxt 3's native TypeScript support simplifies the development process and reduces the need for complex configurations. You can directly use `.ts` files and leverage TypeScript's features without additional setup.

### 5. Composables

- **Nuxt 2:** Didn't have a first-class composables system.
- **Nuxt 3:** Introduces a powerful composables system for sharing and reusing logic across components.

Composables are functions that encapsulate reusable logic, allowing you to keep your components clean and organized. They are typically placed in the `composables` directory.

**Code Example (Composable in Nuxt 3):**

```javascript
// composables/useCounter.js
import { ref } from 'vue'

export const useCounter = () => {
  const count = ref(0)

  const increment = () => {
    count.value++
  }

  const decrement = () => {
    count.value--
  }

  return {
    count,
    increment,
    decrement,
  }
}
```

```plaintext
// components/MyComponent.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
    <button @click="decrement">Decrement</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useCounter } from '@/composables/useCounter';

const { count, increment, decrement } = useCounter();
</script>
```

### 6. Module System

- **Nuxt 2:** Uses a traditional module system requiring specific module configurations.
- **Nuxt 3:** Simplified module system with improved composability and flexibility. Many modules have been rewritten or replaced for better performance and Vue 3 compatibility.

Nuxt 3 introduces new modules that are designed with Vue 3 and Nitro in mind, offering better performance and a more consistent development experience.

### 7. Plugin System

- **Nuxt 2:** Plugins were registered globally.
- **Nuxt 3:** Plugins can be injected directly into the `nuxtApp` instance, offering more control and flexibility.

This change in the plugin system allows for more fine-grained control over plugin initialization and usage.

### 8. Error Handling

- **Nuxt 2:** Used a global error handler.
- **Nuxt 3:** Provides a more robust and flexible error handling mechanism with clear error messages and debugging tools.

Nuxt 3's improved error handling makes it easier to identify and fix issues in your application.

### 9. Telemetry

- **Nuxt 2:** Telemetry was optional but not as transparent.
- **Nuxt 3:** More transparent about telemetry collection (optional) and provides clear information about what data is being collected.

## Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3 Migration Guide

Migrating from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3 requires careful planning and execution. Here's a general guide to help you through the process:

1.  **Assessment:** Evaluate your existing Nuxt 2 application. Identify dependencies, custom modules, and any specific features that need special attention during the migration.

2.  **Update Dependencies:** Update all dependencies to their latest versions in your Nuxt 2 project. This ensures compatibility and reduces potential conflicts during the migration.

3.  **Install Nuxt Bridge:** Install the `@nuxt/bridge` module. This module provides compatibility layers that allow you to gradually migrate your codebase to Nuxt 3 syntax and features.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev @nuxt/bridge
    # or
    yarn add --dev @nuxt/bridge
    ```

4.  **Configure `nuxt.config.js`:** Update your `nuxt.config.js` file to include the `@nuxt/bridge` module and configure it appropriately.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      buildModules: ['@nuxt/bridge'],
      // ... other configurations
    }
    ```

5.  **Migrate to Composition API:** Start migrating your components to the Composition API. This is a gradual process. You can use the Options API and Composition API side-by-side during the migration.

6.  **Update Modules:** Check compatibility of your existing modules. Some modules may need to be updated or replaced with Nuxt 3 compatible alternatives.

7.  **Refactor Plugins:** Update your plugins to use the new plugin system in Nuxt 3.

8.  **Test Thoroughly:** After each migration step, thoroughly test your application to ensure that everything is working as expected.

9.  **Remove `@nuxt/bridge`:** Once you've migrated all components and modules, you can remove the `@nuxt/bridge` module and fully transition to Nuxt 3.

10. **Update to Nuxt 3 syntax:** Now it's time to update your code to the Nuxt 3 syntax. Remove `.sync` modifiers, update the imports (e.g. `Vue.use` to `createApp().use`), and update the usage of directives (e.g. `v-model`).

**Example: Migrating a Simple Component**

**Nuxt 2 Component:**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
