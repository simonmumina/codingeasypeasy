# Streamline Mobile App Internal Distribution: EAS Build for Effortless Testing & Feedback

Developing a mobile app is only half the battle.  Getting it into the hands of your internal team for testing and feedback is crucial for a polished and successful launch.  Fortunately, [Expo Application Services (EAS) Build](https://expo.dev/eas) simplifies this process immensely, providing a powerful and efficient way to distribute your iOS and Android apps internally. This post will guide you through using EAS Build for internal distribution, covering everything from configuration to deployment, and ensuring a smooth testing experience.

## Why Internal Distribution with EAS Build?

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand the advantages of using EAS Build for internal distribution:

*   **Simplified Workflow:** EAS Build abstracts away much of the complexity of building and distributing mobile apps, particularly for React Native projects using Expo.
*   **Centralized Management:** Manage your builds, submissions, and users from a single dashboard.
*   **Faster Iteration Cycles:**  Quickly generate and distribute builds, allowing for rapid iteration based on internal feedback.
*   **Integration with Testing Platforms:** Seamlessly deploy to TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Internal Testing (Android).
*   **Version Control Integration:** EAS Build integrates directly with your Git repository, ensuring a consistent and reliable build process.
*   **OTA Updates (for Expo projects):**  Leverage Over-The-Air (OTA) updates to push code changes to your internal testers without requiring a full app rebuild and redistribution (if using managed workflow).
*   **No Manual Signing (with EAS Credentials Service):**  Let EAS handle the tedious task of code signing, freeing you up to focus on development.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **An Expo or React Native Project:**  This guide assumes you have a pre-existing mobile app project.
*   **Expo CLI Installed:** `npm install -g expo-cli`
*   **EAS CLI Installed:** `npm install -g eas-cli`
*   **Expo Account:**  Sign up for a free Expo account at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).
*   **EAS Project Initialized:**  Run `eas init` in your project directory.
*   **Configured Credentials (Optional, but Recommended):**  While you can manually manage certificates and provisioning profiles, using EAS Credentials Service is highly recommended. Follow the Expo documentation to configure this: [https://docs.expo.dev/build/credentials/](https://docs.expo.dev/build/credentials/)
*   **App Store Connect Account (for iOS):**  Needed for TestFlight distribution.
*   **Google Play Console Account (for Android):**  Needed for Google Play Internal Testing.

## Configuring Your `eas.json`

The `eas.json` file is the heart of your EAS Build configuration.  It defines different build profiles tailored to specific environments, such as development, staging, and production.  For internal distribution, you'll typically create dedicated profiles for iOS and Android.

Here's an example of an `eas.json` configuration for internal distribution:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleDebug"
      },
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Debug"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      },
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    },
    "internal_ios": {
      "extends": "production",
      "ios": {
        "distribution": "internal",
        "buildConfiguration": "Release",
        "appName": "My App (Internal iOS)"
      }
    },
    "internal_android": {
      "extends": "production",
      "android": {
        "distribution": "internal",
        "appName": "My App (Internal Android)",
        "buildType": "apk" // or "app-bundle" for Google Play
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`distribution: "internal"`:** This key instructs EAS Build to prepare the app for internal distribution, creating necessary artifacts for TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Internal Testing (Android).
*   **`extends: "production"`:**  The `internal_ios` and `internal_android` profiles extend the `production` profile, inheriting its default settings and allowing you to override specific configurations for internal distribution.
*   **`appName`:**  You can change the app name to differentiate the internal build from the production build.  This is particularly helpful for distinguishing versions on your testers' devices.
*   **`gradleCommand` (Android - Development):** This specifies the gradle command to build the debug version of your Android app, useful for development builds.
*   **`buildType` (Android - Internal):**  Specifies whether to build an APK or an App Bundle.  For initial internal testing, APK is usually sufficient.  For a more realistic test experience, especially when using advanced Play Store features, consider using App Bundle (`app-bundle`).
*   **`buildConfiguration` (iOS):** Specifies whether to build the Release or Debug version of your iOS app. Use "Release" for internal builds that mimic production.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Android Build Types:**  You can choose between `.apk` and `.aab` (Android App Bundle) for Android builds. `.aab` is recommended for publishing to the Google Play Store as it allows for smaller download sizes and dynamic feature delivery. For internal testing, `.apk` is often sufficient, especially if you're not leveraging advanced features of App Bundles. If you plan to eventually deploy to the Play Store, testing with `.aab` is beneficial.
*   **iOS Build Configurations:**  "Debug" and "Release" are common configurations for iOS builds. "Debug" is typically used during development and includes debugging symbols. "Release" is optimized for performance and is the standard configuration for distribution.

## Building Your App for Internal Distribution

With your `eas.json` configured, you can now build your app for internal distribution using the following commands:

**iOS:**

```bash
eas build -p ios --profile internal_ios
```

**Android:**

```bash
eas build -p android --profile internal_android
```

Replace `internal_ios` and `internal_android` with the names of your internal distribution profiles if you've used different names.

EAS Build will then:

1.  **Queue the Build:** Your build will be added to the EAS Build queue.
2.  **Build the App:**  The app will be built on EAS Build's infrastructure.
3.  **Sign the App:**  The app will be signed using your configured credentials (either automatically with EAS Credentials Service or manually if you've opted for that method).
4.  **Prepare for Distribution:** EAS Build will prepare the necessary artifacts for internal distribution, including the `.ipa` file for iOS and the `.apk` or `.aab` file for Android.

You can monitor the progress of your build on the EAS Build dashboard on [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).

## Distributing Your App

After a successful build, you'll need to distribute your app to your internal testers. EAS Build simplifies this process by integrating with TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Internal Testing (Android).

### iOS Distribution with TestFlight

1.  **Upload to App Store Connect:** If you haven't already, create your app record in App Store Connect ([appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)).
2.  **Create Internal Testers:** In App Store Connect, create internal testers by adding their Apple IDs to the "Users and Access" section. Ensure these users have the "App Manager," "Developer," or "Admin" role.
3.  **Submit to TestFlight:**  You can submit your build to TestFlight directly from the EAS Build dashboard:

    *   Go to the completed build on [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).
    *   Click on "Submit to App Store."
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions to upload your `.ipa` file to App Store Connect and distribute it to your internal testers via TestFlight.

    Alternatively, you can use Transporter (available in the Mac App Store) to upload the .ipa file.

4.  **Testers Install via TestFlight:** Your internal testers will receive an email invitation to install TestFlight.  They can then download and install the app through the TestFlight app on their iOS devices.

### Android Distribution with Google Play Internal Testing

1.  **Create a Google Play Developer Account:** If you haven't already, create a Google Play Developer account at [play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console).
2.  **Create an App:**  Create a new app record in the Google Play Console.
3.  **Set Up Internal Testing:**  In the Google Play Console, navigate to "Testing" -> "Internal Testing."
4.  **Create an Email List:**  Create an email list containing the Google Accounts of your internal testers.
5.  **Add Testers to the List:**  Add the email list to your internal testing track.
6.  **Upload to Google Play:**  You can upload your build to Google Play directly from the EAS Build dashboard (similar to TestFlight) or manually upload the `.apk` or `.aab` file through the Google Play Console.
7.  **Testers Opt-In:**  Your internal testers will receive an email invitation to opt into the internal testing program. They need to click the opt-in link in the email.
8.  **Download from Google Play:** After opting in, your testers can download the app from the Google Play Store. It may take a few hours for the app to become available.  Note that testers must have the Google Play Store app installed on their devices.

## Utilizing OTA Updates for Faster Iteration (Expo Managed Workflow Only)

If you're using the Expo managed workflow, you can leverage Over-The-Air (OTA) updates to push code changes to your internal testers without requiring a full app rebuild and redistribution through TestFlight or Google Play.  This significantly speeds up the iteration process.

1.  **Publish a New Update:** Use the `eas update` command to publish a new OTA update.  This will bundle your JavaScript code and assets and upload them to Expo's servers.

    ```bash
    eas update
    ```

2.  **Specify Target Channel (Optional):**  You can specify a target channel for your update.  This allows you to control which testers receive which updates.  For example, you could have a "stable" channel for general internal testing and a "beta" channel for testing new features.

    ```bash
    eas update --channel beta
    ```

3.  **Testers Receive Updates:**  When your testers launch the app, it will automatically check for and download any available OTA updates.

**Important Considerations for OTA Updates:**

*   **Native Code Changes:** OTA updates only apply to JavaScript code and assets.  If you make changes to native code (e.g., in `android/` or `ios/`), you'll need to rebuild and redistribute the app through TestFlight or Google Play.
*   **Binary Compatibility:**  Ensure that your OTA updates are compatible with the underlying native code. Major changes to native APIs may require a full app rebuild.
*   **Versioning:**  Carefully manage your app versions and OTA updates to ensure that testers are running the correct versions of your code.

## Best Practices for Internal Distribution

*   **Clear Communication:**  Communicate clearly with your internal testers about the purpose of the testing, the features being tested, and how to provide feedback.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:**  Provide easy-to-use feedback mechanisms, such as in-app feedback forms or dedicated communication channels.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Release updates frequently to address bugs and incorporate feedback.
*   **Versioning:**  Use a consistent versioning scheme to track different builds.
*   **Logging:** Implement robust logging to help diagnose issues reported by testers.  Consider using a logging library like `sentry-expo`.
*   **Crash Reporting:**  Integrate crash reporting tools like Sentry or Bugsnag to automatically capture and analyze crashes.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Build Errors:**  Carefully review the EAS Build logs for any error messages. Common issues include incorrect configuration in `app.json` or `eas.json`, missing dependencies, or code signing problems.
*   **TestFlight Issues:**  Ensure that your testers have accepted the TestFlight invitation and have the TestFlight app installed. Verify that the build is processed and available in TestFlight.
*   **Google Play Issues:**  Ensure that your testers have opted into the internal testing program and that the app is available in the Google Play Store for them.  Check for any warnings or errors in the Google Play Console.
*   **OTA Update Issues:**  Verify that you have published the update to the correct channel and that the app is configured to check for updates on that channel.  Check the console logs for any errors related to OTA updates.
