# Mastering JavaScript RegExp Groups: Capture, Name, and Reference Patterns

Regular expressions (RegExp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching in JavaScript. They allow you to search, extract, and manipulate text based on specific rules. While basic regular expressions can handle simple pattern matching, **RegExp groups** take your capabilities to the next level. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of RegExp groups in JavaScript, covering capture groups, named groups, and backreferences, complete with practical examples.

## What are RegExp Groups?

RegExp groups allow you to treat portions of a regular expression pattern as a single unit. This is primarily achieved through parentheses `()`. Parentheses serve two primary purposes:

1.  **Capture Groups:** Capture the matched substring for later use. These captured substrings can be accessed via indexing or through the `exec()` method's return value.

2.  **Grouping for Application of Quantifiers:** Allows you to apply quantifiers like `*`, `+`, `?`, and `{n,m}` to a group of characters instead of just a single character.

Let's illustrate this with a simple example:

```plaintext
const text = "Hello World, Hello Universe";
const regex = /(Hello) (World|Universe)/; // Capture "Hello" and either "World" or "Universe"
const match = regex.exec(text);

console.log(match);
// Output:
// [
//   'Hello World',
//   'Hello',
//   'World',
//   index: 0,
//   input: 'Hello World, Hello Universe',
//   groups: undefined
// ]

console.log(match[0]); // The entire match: "Hello World"
console.log(match[1]); // The first captured group: "Hello"
console.log(match[2]); // The second captured group: "World"
```

In this example, `(Hello)` and `(World|Universe)` are capture groups. The `exec()` method returns an array where:

- `match[0]` contains the entire matched string.
- `match[1]` contains the first captured group (the substring matched by the first set of parentheses).
- `match[2]` contains the second captured group (the substring matched by the second set of parentheses).

## Capture Groups: Extracting Matched Substrings

Capture groups are the foundation of RegExp groups. They allow you to extract specific parts of a matched string. The order of capture groups is determined by the order of the opening parentheses from left to right.

**Example: Extracting Date Components**

Let's say you want to extract the day, month, and year from a date string formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

```plaintext
const dateString = "2024-02-29";
const dateRegex = /(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/; // Capture year, month, and day
const dateMatch = dateRegex.exec(dateString);

if (dateMatch) {
  const year = dateMatch[1];
  const month = dateMatch[2];
  const day = dateMatch[3];

  console.log(`Year: ${year}, Month: ${month}, Day: ${day}`);
  // Output: Year: 2024, Month: 02, Day: 29
}
```

Here, `(\d{4})`, `(\d{2})`, and `(\d{2})` are capture groups that capture the year, month, and day respectively. We then access these captured groups using `dateMatch[1]`, `dateMatch[2]`, and `dateMatch[3]`.

**Using `String.prototype.match()` with Capture Groups**

When using `String.prototype.match()` with a regex _without_ the global flag (`g`), it returns the same kind of array as `RegExp.prototype.exec()`, containing the full match and the captured groups. However, if the global flag is present, it only returns an array of the full matches, without the captured groups.

```plaintext
const text = "apple banana apple cherry";
const regex = /(apple)/;
const regexGlobal = /(apple)/g;

const match = text.match(regex);
const matchGlobal = text.match(regexGlobal);

console.log(match);
// Output:
// [
//   'apple',
//   'apple',
//   index: 0,
//   input: 'apple banana apple cherry',
//   groups: undefined
// ]

console.log(matchGlobal);
// Output: [ 'apple', 'apple' ]
```

## Named Groups: Referencing Groups by Name

While indexing works, it can become cumbersome to remember the index of each captured group, especially in complex regular expressions. **Named groups**, introduced in ECMAScript 2018, provide a much more readable and maintainable way to access captured groups.

To create a named group, use the syntax `(?<name>...)`, where `name` is the name you want to assign to the group.

**Example: Extracting Person Details with Named Groups**

```plaintext
const personString = "Name: John Doe, Age: 30, City: New York";
const personRegex = /Name: (?<name>[^,]+), Age: (?<age>\d+), City: (?<city>[^,]+)/;
const personMatch = personRegex.exec(personString);

if (personMatch) {
  const name = personMatch.groups.name;
  const age = personMatch.groups.age;
  const city = personMatch.groups.city;

  console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}, City: ${city}`);
  // Output: Name: John Doe, Age: 30, City: New York
}
```

In this example, `(?<name>[^,]+)`, `(?<age>\d+)`, and `(?<city>[^,]+)` are named groups with the names `name`, `age`, and `city`, respectively. We access these groups through the `groups` property of the `match` object: `personMatch.groups.name`, `personMatch.groups.age`, and `personMatch.groups.city`. This is far more descriptive and easier to understand than relying on index numbers.

## Backreferences: Matching Previously Captured Text

**Backreferences** allow you to match the same text that was previously captured by a group within the same regular expression. They are specified using `\n`, where `n` is the index of the capture group (starting from 1).

**Example: Finding Duplicate Words**

```plaintext
const textWithDuplicates = "This is a test test string.";
const duplicateRegex = /(\w+)\s+\1/; // Capture a word and then match the same word again
const duplicateMatch = duplicateRegex.exec(textWithDuplicates);

if (duplicateMatch) {
  console.log(`Duplicate word found: ${duplicateMatch[1]}`);
  // Output: Duplicate word found: test
}
```

In this example, `(\w+)` captures a word. `\1` is a backreference that refers to the text captured by the first group (`(\w+)`). The regex `(\w+)\s+\1` matches a word followed by one or more spaces, followed by the same word again.

**Named Backreferences:**

With named groups, you can use named backreferences using `\k<name>`.

```plaintext
const textWithDuplicates = "This is a test test string.";
const duplicateRegex = /(?<word>\w+)\s+\k<word>/; // Capture a word and then match the same word again
const duplicateMatch = duplicateRegex.exec(textWithDuplicates);

if (duplicateMatch) {
  console.log(`Duplicate word found: ${duplicateMatch.groups.word}`);
  // Output: Duplicate word found: test
}
```

This achieves the same result as the previous example but uses the named group `word` for clarity.

## Non-Capturing Groups: Grouping without Capturing

Sometimes, you might want to use parentheses for grouping but don't need to capture the matched text. In these cases, you can use **non-capturing groups** using the syntax `(?:...)`.

**Example: Matching Different Phone Number Formats**

```plaintext
const phoneNumber1 = "123-456-7890";
const phoneNumber2 = "(123) 456-7890";
const phoneNumberRegex = /^(?:\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})[- ]?\d{3}[- ]?\d{4}$/;

console.log(phoneNumberRegex.test(phoneNumber1)); // true
console.log(phoneNumberRegex.test(phoneNumber2)); // true
```

Here, `(?:\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})` matches either a three-digit area code in parentheses or a three-digit area code without parentheses. The `(?:...)` ensures that this group is not captured. We are only interested in validating the format, not extracting the area code.

## Combining RegExp Groups for Advanced Pattern Matching

You can combine capture groups, named groups, backreferences, and non-capturing groups to create sophisticated regular expressions.

**Example: Validating HTML Tags with Named Groups and Backreferences**

```plaintext
const htmlString = "<p>This is a paragraph.</p>";
const htmlRegex = /<(?<tag>\w+)>.*<\/\k<tag>>/;
const htmlMatch = htmlRegex.exec(htmlString);

if (htmlMatch) {
  console.log(`Valid HTML tag: ${htmlMatch.groups.tag}`);
  // Output: Valid HTML tag: p
}
```

This regex checks if an HTML tag has a matching closing tag.

- `(?<tag>\w+)` captures the tag name (e.g., "p", "div").
- `.*` matches any characters between the opening and closing tags.
- `<\/\k<tag>>` matches the closing tag, using a named backreference `\k<tag>` to ensure that the closing tag matches the opening tag.

## Conclusion

RegExp groups are an essential tool for anyone working with regular expressions in JavaScript. Understanding how to use capture groups, named groups, backreferences, and non-capturing groups will significantly enhance your ability to perform complex pattern matching, data extraction, and string manipulation. By leveraging these features, you can write more readable, maintainable, and powerful regular expressions to solve a wide range of problems. Remember to test your regular expressions thoroughly with different inputs to ensure they behave as expected. Happy coding!
