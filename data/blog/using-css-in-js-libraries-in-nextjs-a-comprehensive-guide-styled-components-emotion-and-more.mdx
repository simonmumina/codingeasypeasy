# Using CSS-in-JS Libraries in Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide

Next.js offers a powerful and flexible framework for building performant React applications. While traditional CSS stylesheets and CSS Modules can be used for styling, CSS-in-JS libraries provide a compelling alternative, offering component-level styling, dynamic theming, and improved maintainability. This guide will walk you through integrating popular CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components and Emotion into your Next.js projects. We'll cover installation, usage, server-side rendering considerations, and performance tips.

## What is CSS-in-JS?

CSS-in-JS is a technique that allows you to write CSS styles directly within your JavaScript (or TypeScript) code. Instead of relying on separate CSS files, you define styles as JavaScript objects or template literals, which are then dynamically injected into the DOM. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Component-Level Styling:** Styles are tightly coupled to the component they style, making it easier to reason about and maintain your code. No more accidental style bleed-through from global stylesheets.
- **Dynamic Theming:** Easily switch between different themes by modifying JavaScript variables that control the styling.
- **Scoped Styles:** Styles are automatically scoped to the component, preventing naming collisions and ensuring that styles only affect the intended elements.
- **Dead Code Elimination:** CSS-in-JS libraries can often eliminate unused CSS styles at build time, reducing the size of your CSS bundle.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** CSS-in-JS libraries often provide powerful features like auto-prefixing, linting, and CSS preprocessor support (like SCSS or LESS) directly within your JavaScript environment.

## Popular CSS-in-JS Libraries for Next.js

Several excellent CSS-in-JS libraries can be used with Next.js. Here are a few of the most popular choices:

- **Styled Components:** One of the most widely used CSS-in-JS libraries, known for its intuitive API and powerful features.
- **Emotion:** Another popular option, known for its excellent performance and flexible styling options. It supports both object styles and tagged template literals.
- **Material UI (MUI) and other component libraries:** Many component libraries utilize CSS-in-JS internally, providing a consistent and themeable styling solution. While not strictly a standalone CSS-in-JS library, you'll often interact with their styling APIs.

This guide will primarily focus on **Styled Components** and **Emotion**, as they are commonly used and illustrate the core concepts well.

## Setting up Styled Components in Next.js

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install styled-components
    # or
    yarn add styled-components
    ```

2.  **Configure `babel-plugin-styled-components` (Important for SSR):**

    Styled Components requires a Babel plugin to correctly handle server-side rendering (SSR) and ensure styles are injected into the HTML during the initial page load.

    First, install the plugin:

    ```plaintext
    npm install babel-plugin-styled-components
    # or
    yarn add babel-plugin-styled-components
    ```

    Then, update your `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` file to include the plugin. Create one if it doesn't exist.

    **Example `.babelrc`:**

    ```plaintext
    {
      "presets": ["next/babel"],
      "plugins": [["styled-components", { "ssr": true }]]
    }
    ```

    **Example `babel.config.js`:**

    ```plaintext
    module.exports = {
      presets: ['next/babel'],
      plugins: [
        [
          'babel-plugin-styled-components',
          {
            ssr: true,
            displayName: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production', // Optional: Improve debugging experience
            pure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // Optional: Optimize for production builds
          },
        ],
      ],
    }
    ```

    - `ssr: true`: Enables server-side rendering support.
    - `displayName`: Adds class names that are easier to read in the browser's developer tools. Useful during development.
    - `pure`: Optimizes for production by removing unnecessary style injections.

3.  **Create a `_document.js` file (or modify if it already exists):**

    Next.js uses the `_document.js` file to customize the `<html>` and `<body>` tags of your application. We need to use it to collect the Styled Components styles during server-side rendering and inject them into the `<head>` of the document. Create a file named `pages/_document.js` (or `pages/_document.tsx` for TypeScript) with the following content:

    ```plaintext
    import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
    import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components'

    export default class MyDocument extends Document {
      static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
        const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet()
        const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage

        try {
          ctx.renderPage = () =>
            originalRenderPage({
              enhanceApp: (App) => (props) => sheet.collectStyles(<App {...props} />),
            })

          const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)
          return {
            ...initialProps,
            styles: (
              <>
                {initialProps.styles}
                {sheet.getStyleElement()}
              </>
            ),
          }
        } finally {
          sheet.seal()
        }
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <Html>
            <Head />
            <body>
              <Main />
              <NextScript />
            </body>
          </Html>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

    This code:

    - Creates a `ServerStyleSheet` instance.
    - Wraps the `App` component with `sheet.collectStyles` to gather the styles during rendering.
    - Extracts the styles using `sheet.getStyleElement()` and injects them into the `<head>`.
    - Calls `sheet.seal()` to prevent further modifications to the stylesheet.

## Using Styled Components

Now that you've set up Styled Components, you can start using it to style your components.

**Example:**

```jsx
// components/MyComponent.js
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: #4caf50; /* Green */
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #3e8e41;
  }
`

function MyComponent() {
  return <StyledButton>Click Me!</StyledButton>
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example:

- We import the `styled` function from `styled-components`.
- We use `styled.button` to create a styled `button` component. You can use `styled.div`, `styled.span`, `styled.a`, etc., for other HTML elements.
- We define the CSS styles using a tagged template literal.
- We use the `&:hover` selector to define styles that apply when the button is hovered over.

## Setting up Emotion in Next.js

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```plaintext
   npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled
   # or
   yarn add @emotion/react @emotion/styled
   ```

2. **Configure `babel-plugin-emotion` (Important for SSR):**

   Emotion also requires a Babel plugin for server-side rendering.

   First, install the plugin:

   ```plaintext
   npm install @emotion/babel-plugin
   # or
   yarn add @emotion/babel-plugin
   ```

   Then, update your `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` file to include the plugin. Create one if it doesn't exist.

   **Example `.babelrc`:**

   ```plaintext
   {
     "presets": ["next/babel"],
     "plugins": ["@emotion/babel-plugin"]
   }
   ```

   **Example `babel.config.js`:**

   ```plaintext
   module.exports = {
     presets: ['next/babel'],
     plugins: ['@emotion/babel-plugin'],
   }
   ```

3. **Configure `_document.js` (for Emotion v11+):**
   Emotion v11 and later versions have a streamlined SSR approach. You no longer generally need a custom `_document.js`. The Babel plugin handles much of the server-side extraction. However, if you are running into issues, or using an older version, the below is for reference:

   ```plaintext
   import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
   import createEmotionServer from '@emotion/server/create-instance'
   import { CacheProvider } from '@emotion/react'
   import { createEmotionCache } from '../utils/create-emotion-cache' // Create this file (see below)

   function createEmotionCache() {
     return createCache({ key: 'css', prepend: true })
   }
   // Export it at the top.

   export default class MyDocument extends Document {
     static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
       const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage
       const cache = createEmotionCache()
       const { extractCriticalToChunks } = createEmotionServer(cache)

       ctx.renderPage = () =>
         originalRenderPage({
           enhanceApp: (App) => (props) => (
             <CacheProvider value={cache}>
               <App {...props} />
             </CacheProvider>
           ),
         })

       const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)
       const emotionStyles = extractCriticalToChunks(initialProps.html)
       const emotionStyleTags = emotionStyles.styles.map((style) => (
         <style
           data-emotion={`${style.key} ${style.ids.join(' ')}`}
           key={style.key}
           dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: style.css }}
         />
       ))

       return {
         ...initialProps,
         styles: [...React.Children.toArray(initialProps.styles), ...emotionStyleTags],
       }
     }

     render() {
       return (
         <Html>
           <Head></Head>
           <body>
             <Main />
             <NextScript />
           </body>
         </Html>
       )
     }
   }
   ```

   **utils/create-emotion-cache.js:**

   ```plaintext
   import createCache from '@emotion/cache'

   function createEmotionCache() {
     return createCache({ key: 'css', prepend: true })
   }

   export default createEmotionCache
   ```

   **Explanation of `_document.js` for Emotion:**

   - We create an Emotion cache. The `key: 'css'` is the crucial part for Emotion's SSR to work correctly. The `prepend: true` option ensures that Emotion's styles are injected _before_ any other styles, which is essential to override styles correctly.
   - We wrap the `App` component with the `CacheProvider`.
   - We extract Emotion styles from the rendered HTML.
   - We inject the Emotion styles into the `<head>` of the document.

## Using Emotion

Emotion provides several ways to style components:

**Styled Components-like Syntax (using `styled`):**

```jsx
// components/MyComponent.js
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: #4caf50; /* Green */
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #3e8e41;
  }
`

function MyComponent() {
  return <StyledButton>Click Me!</StyledButton>
}

export default MyComponent
```

This syntax is very similar to Styled Components, making it easy to switch between the two libraries.

**Object Styles (using `css`):**

```jsx
// components/MyComponent.js
import { css } from '@emotion/react'

const buttonStyle = css`
  background-color: #4caf50; /* Green */
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #3e8e41;
  }
`

function MyComponent() {
  return <button css={buttonStyle}>Click Me!</button>
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example, we define the styles as a CSS string using the `css` tagged template literal. We then apply the styles to the `<button>` element using the `css` prop. This provides more flexibility and allows you to reuse styles across multiple components.

**Using Themes with Emotion:**

Emotion has excellent theming support. You can define a theme object and access it within your styles using the `theme` prop.

1.  **Create a Theme:**

    ```plaintext
    // theme.js
    const theme = {
      colors: {
        primary: '#4CAF50',
        secondary: '#3e8e41',
      },
      spacing: {
        small: '8px',
        medium: '16px',
      },
    }

    export default theme
    ```

2.  **Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider`:**

    ```jsx
    // _app.js
    import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react'
    import theme from '../theme'

    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
      return (
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ThemeProvider>
      )
    }

    export default MyApp
    ```

3.  **Access the theme within your styles:**

    ```jsx
    // components/MyComponent.js
    import styled from '@emotion/styled'

    const StyledButton = styled.button`
      background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.primary};
      border: none;
      color: white;
      padding: ${(props) => props.theme.spacing.medium};
      text-align: center;
      text-decoration: none;
      display: inline-block;
      font-size: 16px;
      cursor: pointer;

      &:hover {
        background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.secondary};
      }
    `

    function MyComponent() {
      return <StyledButton>Click Me!</StyledButton>
    }

    export default MyComponent
    ```

## Performance Considerations

While CSS-in-JS libraries offer many benefits, it's important to be aware of potential performance implications:

- **Runtime Overhead:** CSS-in-JS libraries add some runtime overhead because styles are generated and injected dynamically. This overhead is generally small, but it can become noticeable in large, complex applications.
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Correctly configuring SSR is crucial for performance and SEO. Incorrect setup can lead to "flash of unstyled content" (FOUC) or poor initial page load times. The Babel plugin is key here.

**Tips for Optimizing Performance:**

- **Use Production Builds:** Ensure you are using production builds (e.g., `next build && next start`) to take advantage of optimizations like CSS minification and dead code elimination.
- **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically code-splits your application into smaller chunks, which can improve initial load times.
- **Caching:** Leverage browser caching and server-side caching to reduce the amount of work required to render pages.
- **Profile Your Application:** Use browser developer tools to profile your application and identify any performance bottlenecks related to CSS-in-JS.
- **Consider Alternatives for Static Styling:** If you have components that don't require dynamic styling or theming, consider using traditional CSS or CSS Modules for those components to reduce runtime overhead. Tools like Tailwind CSS are great when you want utilities as well.
- **Use CSS Preprocessors (Sass, Less):** Both Styled Components and Emotion support using CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less, which can make your CSS code more organized and maintainable without sacrificing the benefits of CSS-in-JS. Refer to their individual documentation.

## Choosing the Right Library

The best CSS-in-JS library for your Next.js project depends on your specific needs and preferences.

- **Styled Components:** A good choice if you prefer a straightforward and widely adopted library with a clear and intuitive API. It shines when component definitions align strongly with their styles.
- **Emotion:** A strong contender if you value performance and flexibility. Its object styles and theme support offer a lot of control over your styling.

## Conclusion

CSS-in-JS libraries provide a powerful and convenient way to style your Next.js applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly integrate Styled Components or Emotion into your projects, improve component maintainability, and build visually appealing and performant user interfaces. Remember to pay attention to server-side rendering and performance considerations to ensure a smooth user experience. Experiment with both libraries to determine which best fits your development style and project requirements. Happy styling!
