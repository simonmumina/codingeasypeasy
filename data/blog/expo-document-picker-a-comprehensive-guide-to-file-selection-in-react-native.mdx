# Expo Document Picker: A Comprehensive Guide to File Selection in React Native

The Expo Document Picker is a powerful and convenient library that allows your React Native applications to access files from various sources on the user's device. Whether you need to upload documents, images, videos, or any other type of file, the `expo-document-picker` library provides a straightforward and cross-platform solution. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Expo Document Picker into your React Native project, covering everything from installation to advanced customization.

## What is Expo Document Picker?

The `expo-document-picker` library is an Expo SDK module that enables users to select files from their device's storage or connected cloud services (like iCloud, Google Drive, etc.). It abstracts away the complexities of platform-specific file picker APIs, providing a consistent interface for both iOS and Android. This makes it incredibly easy to implement file selection functionality in your React Native apps without having to write separate code for each platform.

## Why Use Expo Document Picker?

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple API and straightforward setup with Expo.
- **Wide File Support:** Supports a wide range of file types.
- **Cloud Service Integration:** Allows users to select files from cloud storage providers.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Integrates smoothly with existing React Native projects.
- **Simplified Development:** Reduces the complexity of handling platform-specific file selection APIs.
- **Better User Experience:** Provides a familiar and intuitive file selection experience for users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Make sure you have Node.js installed along with either npm or yarn as your package manager.
- **Expo CLI:** Install the Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
- **Expo Project:** You'll need an existing Expo project or create a new one using `expo init`.
- **Expo Go app or a simulator/emulator:** To test your application, you'll need the Expo Go app on your mobile device, or an iOS simulator/Android emulator configured with Expo.

## Installation

To install the `expo-document-picker` library, run the following command in your project's root directory:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-document-picker
```

This command automatically installs the necessary native dependencies and links them to your project (if needed). If you are not using Expo Go and instead using a standalone app you will need to rebuild your native project after running the above command.

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `expo-document-picker` to pick a document:

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { Button, Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker'

export default function App() {
  const [document, setDocument] = useState(null)

  const pickDocument = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
        type: '*/*', // Allow all file types
        multiple: false, // Only allow single file selection
      })

      if (result.type === 'success') {
        setDocument(result)
      } else {
        console.log('Document picking cancelled')
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('Error picking document:', err)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Pick a Document" onPress={pickDocument} />
      {document && (
        <View style={styles.documentInfo}>
          <Text>Name: {document.name}</Text>
          <Text>Type: {document.mimeType}</Text>
          <Text>Size: {document.size} bytes</Text>
          <Text>URI: {document.uri}</Text>
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  documentInfo: {
    marginTop: 20,
    padding: 10,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** We import `React`, `useState`, `Button`, `Text`, `View`, `StyleSheet` from `react-native` and `DocumentPicker` from `expo-document-picker`.
2.  **Create a state variable:** `document` will hold the information about the selected document.
3.  **`pickDocument` function:**
    - Calls `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` with options for `type` and `multiple`.
    - `type: '*/*'` allows the selection of any file type. You can specify specific MIME types here if needed. For example, `type: 'image/*'` will allow the selection of only image files. `type: 'application/pdf'` will only allow the selection of PDF documents.
    - `multiple: false` restricts the user to selecting only one file at a time. Setting it to `true` enables multi-file selection, and the `result` will be an array of files.
    - If the result `type` is `success`, we update the `document` state with the returned information.
    - If the user cancels the selection, a message is logged.
    - Error handling is included in the `catch` block.
4.  **Rendering the UI:** A button triggers the `pickDocument` function when pressed. If a document has been selected (i.e., `document` is not null), information about the document (name, type, size, and URI) is displayed.

## Handling Multiple Files

To allow users to select multiple files, set the `multiple` option to `true` in `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()`:

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { Button, Text, View, StyleSheet, ScrollView } from 'react-native'
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker'

export default function App() {
  const [documents, setDocuments] = useState([])

  const pickDocuments = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
        type: '*/*',
        multiple: true, // Allow multiple file selection
      })

      if (result.type === 'success') {
        setDocuments(result.output) // result.output is an array of documents.  result.assets will be an empty array.
      } else {
        console.log('Document picking cancelled')
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('Error picking documents:', err)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Pick Documents" onPress={pickDocuments} />
      <ScrollView style={styles.documentList}>
        {documents.map((doc, index) => (
          <View key={index} style={styles.documentInfo}>
            <Text>Name: {doc.name}</Text>
            <Text>Type: {doc.mimeType}</Text>
            <Text>Size: {doc.size} bytes</Text>
            <Text>URI: {doc.uri}</Text>
          </View>
        ))}
      </ScrollView>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  documentList: {
    marginTop: 20,
    width: '100%',
  },
  documentInfo: {
    padding: 10,
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: '#ccc',
    borderRadius: 5,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
})
```

**Key Changes:**

- The `multiple: true` option is set in `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()`.
- The `documents` state variable is now an array.
- The `setDocuments` state is updated with `result.output`, which is an array of selected documents.
- We use `ScrollView` and `map` to display information for each selected document.

## Specifying File Types

You can restrict the types of files that the user can select by using the `type` option. Here are a few examples:

- **Images Only:**

  ```plaintext
  const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
    type: 'image/*',
    multiple: false,
  })
  ```

- **PDFs Only:**

  ```plaintext
  const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
    type: 'application/pdf',
    multiple: false,
  })
  ```

- **Multiple Specific Types (Android only):**

  On Android, you can specify an array of MIME types:

  ```plaintext
  const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
    type: ['application/pdf', 'image/*'], // Allow PDFs and images
    multiple: false,
  })
  ```

  **Important Note:** On iOS, the `type` option only supports a single MIME type string or `'*/*'`. If you need to restrict to multiple types on iOS, you'll need to implement custom filtering after the user selects the file (e.g., check the `mimeType` property of the selected file).

## File URI Considerations

The `uri` property of the returned document object is a local URI that points to the selected file. However, it's important to note that this URI might be temporary, especially on Android. Therefore:

- **Don't store the URI persistently:** The URI might become invalid if the app is restarted or the file is moved.
- **Copy the file if needed:** If you need to access the file later, consider copying it to your app's local storage. The `expo-file-system` library can be useful for this.
- **Use the URI immediately:** Process the file as soon as it's selected.

## Advanced Usage and Customization

### Copying the file to your application's directory

For better control and persistence of the selected files, you can copy them to your application's directory using `expo-file-system`.

```plaintext
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker'
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'

const copyDocumentToAppDir = async (document) => {
  try {
    const appDirectory = FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'my_documents/'
    await FileSystem.makeDirectoryAsync(appDirectory, { intermediates: true })

    const newUri = appDirectory + document.name
    await FileSystem.copyAsync({
      from: document.uri,
      to: newUri,
    })

    return newUri // Return the new, persistent URI
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error copying document:', error)
    return null
  }
}

const pickAndCopyDocument = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
      type: '*/*',
      multiple: false,
    })

    if (result.type === 'success') {
      const newUri = await copyDocumentToAppDir(result)
      if (newUri) {
        console.log('Document copied to:', newUri)
        // Use the newUri for persistent access to the file.
      } else {
        console.log('Failed to copy document.')
      }
    } else {
      console.log('Document picking cancelled')
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('Error picking document:', err)
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `expo-file-system`:** We import the `FileSystem` module from `expo-file-system`.
2.  **`copyDocumentToAppDir` function:**
    - Creates a directory within the app's document directory to store the copied files.
    - Copies the selected file from its original URI to the new directory.
    - Returns the new URI of the copied file.
3.  **`pickAndCopyDocument` function:**
    - Calls `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` to pick the document.
    - Calls `copyDocumentToAppDir()` to copy the selected document to the app's directory.
    - Logs the new URI or an error message.

**Important Considerations when copying files:**

- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary file system permissions configured for your Expo project in the `app.json` or `app.config.js` file. Consult the `expo-file-system` documentation for specific permission requirements.
- **Storage Space:** Be mindful of the amount of storage space your app is using, especially when copying large files. Implement mechanisms to manage and delete files when they are no longer needed.

### Handling File Uploads

After a user selects a file, you will likely want to upload it to a server. Here's a basic example using `fetch`:

```plaintext
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker'
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'

const uploadDocument = async (document) => {
  try {
    const formData = new FormData()
    formData.append('file', {
      uri: document.uri,
      type: document.mimeType,
      name: document.name,
    })

    const response = await fetch('YOUR_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
      },
    })

    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json()
      console.log('Upload successful:', data)
    } else {
      console.error('Upload failed:', response.status)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error uploading document:', error)
  }
}

const pickAndUploadDocument = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({
      type: '*/*',
      multiple: false,
    })

    if (result.type === 'success') {
      await uploadDocument(result)
    } else {
      console.log('Document picking cancelled')
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('Error picking document:', err)
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Create a `FormData` object:** We create a `FormData` object to encapsulate the file data for uploading.
2.  **Append the file to `FormData`:** We append the file to the `FormData` object, including the `uri`, `type` (MIME type), and `name` properties. These properties are crucial for the server to correctly process the uploaded file. The `uri` points to the file, `type` informs the server about the content type, and `name` provides the original filename.
3.  **Make a `fetch` request:** We make a `fetch` request to your upload endpoint, setting the `method` to `POST` and the `body` to the `FormData` object. We also set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`, which is essential for sending file data.
4.  **Handle the response:** We handle the response from the server, checking for errors and logging the result.

**Important Considerations for File Uploads:**

- **Server-Side Implementation:** You'll need to implement a server-side endpoint to handle the file upload. The implementation details will depend on your chosen server-side technology (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP).
- **File Size Limits:** Be aware of file size limits on both the client and server sides. You might need to implement mechanisms to handle large files, such as chunked uploads.
- **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect your upload endpoint from unauthorized access and malicious uploads. This may include authentication, authorization, and file validation.
- **Progress Tracking:** For large files, consider implementing progress tracking to provide feedback to the user during the upload process. Some libraries, like `axios`, provide built-in support for upload progress events.

## Error Handling

It's essential to handle potential errors that might occur during the document picking process. Common errors include:

- **Permissions Denied:** The user might not grant your app the necessary permissions to access files.
- **File Not Found:** The file might not exist at the specified URI.
- **Network Errors:** Network errors might occur if the file is located on a remote server.
- **Cancellation:** The user might cancel the document picking process.

The examples above include basic error handling with `try...catch` blocks. You can provide more user-friendly error messages and implement retry mechanisms as needed.

## Platform-Specific Considerations

While the `expo-document-picker` library aims to provide a cross-platform abstraction, there are a few platform-specific considerations to keep in mind:

- **iOS:** On iOS, the user interface for the document picker is provided by the system. You have limited control over its appearance.
- **Android:** On Android, the behavior of the document picker can vary depending on the device and the installed file manager apps.

## Alternatives to Expo Document Picker

While `expo-document-picker` is a great choice for Expo-based React Native projects, here are a few alternative libraries for file picking:

- **`react-native-document-picker`**: A community-maintained alternative with a similar API. It supports picking files on both iOS and Android. It doesn't require the Expo SDK.

Choose the library that best suits your project's requirements and dependencies.

## Conclusion

The Expo Document Picker provides a convenient and cross-platform way to enable file selection in your React Native applications. By following this guide, you can seamlessly integrate the library into your project, handle different file types, and upload files to your server. Remember to handle errors gracefully and consider platform-specific considerations for a smooth user experience. Happy coding!
