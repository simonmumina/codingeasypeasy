# Hoist Non-React Statics: Preserve Component Properties When Using HOCs

Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are a powerful pattern in React for code reuse and component composition. However, they can sometimes lead to the loss of static methods and properties defined on the wrapped component. This is where `hoist-non-react-statics` comes in handy. In this article, we'll explore why preserving static properties is important, how `hoist-non-react-statics` works, and how to use it effectively with practical code examples.

## What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?

Before diving into `hoist-non-react-statics`, let's briefly recap what Higher-Order Components are. A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new, enhanced component. HOCs are typically used to:

- Share common logic between components.
- Add or modify props.
- Wrap components with styling or layout.
- Provide context.

Here's a simple example of an HOC that adds logging functionality:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'

const withLogging = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} mounted`)
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />
    }
  }
}

export default withLogging
```

## The Problem: Loss of Static Properties

The problem arises because the HOC returns a _new_ component. This new component doesn't automatically inherit the static properties (methods and properties defined directly on the component class, not on its prototype or instances) of the original component. These static properties can be essential for various reasons:

- **Data fetching:** Static methods might be used to fetch data required to render the component (e.g., `getStaticProps` in Next.js).
- **Configuration:** Static properties could define default configurations or settings.
- **Testing:** Static properties might be used by testing frameworks for component identification or mocking.
- **Third-party libraries:** Some libraries rely on specific static properties being present on React components.

Consider this example:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>My Component</div>
  }
}

MyComponent.staticMethod = () => {
  console.log('Static method called')
}

// Using the withLogging HOC from before
const EnhancedComponent = withLogging(MyComponent)

// Calling the static method on the enhanced component
// EnhancedComponent.staticMethod(); // This will throw an error if not hoisted!
```

If we try to call `EnhancedComponent.staticMethod()`, we'll get an error because the `withLogging` HOC created a new component that doesn't have the `staticMethod` property.

## The Solution: `hoist-non-react-statics`

`hoist-non-react-statics` is a small utility package that solves this problem by copying all non-React static properties from the wrapped component to the enhanced component. It intelligently filters out React-specific static properties that are already managed by React itself (like `propTypes`, `contextTypes`, and `defaultProps`).

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install hoist-non-react-statics
# or
yarn add hoist-non-react-statics
```

**Usage:**

Let's modify our `withLogging` HOC to use `hoist-non-react-statics`:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import hoistNonReactStatics from 'hoist-non-react-statics'

const withLogging = (WrappedComponent) => {
  class EnhancedComponent extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} mounted`)
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />
    }
  }

  hoistNonReactStatics(EnhancedComponent, WrappedComponent)

  return EnhancedComponent
}

export default withLogging
```

Now, when we use `withLogging`, the `staticMethod` will be available on the enhanced component:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import withLogging from './withLogging' // Assuming withLogging is in a separate file

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>My Component</div>
  }
}

MyComponent.staticMethod = () => {
  console.log('Static method called')
}

const EnhancedComponent = withLogging(MyComponent)

EnhancedComponent.staticMethod() // This will now work correctly!
```

## Why `hoist-non-react-statics` is Important

- **Prevents Unexpected Errors:** Failing to preserve static properties can lead to runtime errors when code relies on those properties being present.
- **Maintains Component Integrity:** Ensures that the enhanced component behaves as expected, maintaining the original component's functionality and API.
- **Improves Code Maintainability:** Makes HOCs more robust and predictable, reducing the risk of introducing bugs when refactoring or extending components.
- **Compatibility with Libraries and Frameworks:** Ensures compatibility with libraries and frameworks that rely on static properties for component configuration or metadata.

## Common Use Cases

- **Data Fetching with Next.js:** When using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` in Next.js, preserving these static methods is crucial for data fetching.
- **Styled Components:** When using `styled-components` with the `.attrs` API, you often define static properties. `hoist-non-react-statics` ensures these are preserved.
- **Form Libraries:** Some form libraries might expect specific static properties on form components.

## Example: Preserving `getStaticProps` in Next.js

```plaintext
// pages/my-page.js
import React from 'react'
import hoistNonReactStatics from 'hoist-non-react-statics'

function MyPage(props) {
  return <div>My Page: {props.data}</div>
}

MyPage.getStaticProps = async () => {
  const data = await fetchData() // Replace with your data fetching logic
  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  }
}

// Example HOC (simplified)
const withAuthentication = (WrappedComponent) => {
  class AuthenticatedComponent extends React.Component {
    // Authentication logic here
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />
    }
  }

  hoistNonReactStatics(AuthenticatedComponent, WrappedComponent)
  return AuthenticatedComponent
}

export default withAuthentication(MyPage)

async function fetchData() {
  // Simulate fetching data from an API
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100))
  return 'Fetched data'
}
```

In this example, `hoistNonReactStatics` ensures that `MyPage.getStaticProps` is still accessible after being wrapped by the `withAuthentication` HOC, allowing Next.js to properly fetch the data for the page.

## Alternatives

While `hoist-non-react-statics` is a widely used and reliable solution, alternative approaches exist:

- **React.forwardRef:** If you're primarily concerned with passing refs through your HOC, `React.forwardRef` can be a simpler solution. However, it doesn't handle other static properties.
- **Explicitly Copying Properties:** You can manually copy the static properties from the wrapped component to the enhanced component. However, this is more verbose and error-prone.

## Conclusion

`hoist-non-react-statics` is an essential tool for working with Higher-Order Components in React. It ensures that static methods and properties are preserved, preventing unexpected errors and maintaining component integrity. By using `hoist-non-react-statics`, you can write more robust, maintainable, and predictable HOCs, making your React codebase cleaner and more efficient. Remember to always consider the potential for losing static properties when using HOCs and use `hoist-non-react-statics` to avoid common pitfalls.
