# How to Install Gatsby and Create a New Project: A Step-by-Step Guide

Gatsby is a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing-fast websites and apps. It's a powerful static site generator (SSG) that combines the best parts of React, GraphQL, and modern web development techniques to deliver an exceptional developer experience and optimal website performance.

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Gatsby and setting up a new project from scratch. Whether you're new to Gatsby or looking to refresh your knowledge, this comprehensive tutorial will provide you with the necessary steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** Gatsby requires Node.js to run. It is recommended to use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

- **npm or Yarn:** Node Package Manager (npm) comes bundled with Node.js. Alternatively, you can use Yarn, another popular package manager. This guide will primarily use npm, but the commands are similar for Yarn. You can install Yarn from [https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you prefer.

- **Code Editor:** A code editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom is essential for writing and editing code.

## Step 1: Installing the Gatsby CLI

The Gatsby Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that allows you to create, develop, and deploy Gatsby sites. To install the Gatsby CLI globally, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```plaintext
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

This command installs the `gatsby-cli` package globally, making the `gatsby` command available from any directory on your system.

**Explanation:**

- `npm install`: This is the npm command used to install packages.
- `-g`: This flag tells npm to install the package globally. This means it's available to all projects on your system, not just within a specific project directory.
- `gatsby-cli`: This is the name of the Gatsby CLI package.

After the installation is complete, you can verify that the Gatsby CLI is installed correctly by running:

```plaintext
gatsby --version
```

This command will display the installed version of the Gatsby CLI.

## Step 2: Creating a New Gatsby Project

Now that you have the Gatsby CLI installed, you can create a new Gatsby project. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project using the `cd` command in your terminal.

```plaintext
cd path/to/your/projects/directory
```

Once you're in the desired directory, use the `gatsby new` command to create a new Gatsby project. This command takes the name of the project as an argument. You can also optionally specify a starter template.

```plaintext
gatsby new my-gatsby-site
```

This command will create a new directory named `my-gatsby-site` with a basic Gatsby site. It uses the default Gatsby starter, which includes a minimal set of files and configurations.

**Using a Starter Template**

Gatsby starters are pre-configured Gatsby projects that provide a good starting point for various types of websites. You can find a wide range of Gatsby starters on the [Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/).

To use a starter template, specify the URL of the Git repository of the starter as the second argument to the `gatsby new` command. For example, to create a new Gatsby project using the `gatsby-starter-blog` starter, you would run:

```plaintext
gatsby new my-blog-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

This command will clone the `gatsby-starter-blog` repository and create a new Gatsby project named `my-blog-site` based on that starter.

**Custom Starter Options:**

Some starters may require additional configuration options. Refer to the starter's documentation for any specific instructions.

## Step 3: Running the Development Server

After the project is created, navigate into the project directory:

```plaintext
cd my-gatsby-site
```

Now, start the Gatsby development server by running the following command:

```plaintext
gatsby develop
```

This command will start a local development server on port 8000 (by default). You can access your Gatsby site by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000`.

**Explanation:**

- `gatsby develop`: This command starts the Gatsby development server, which automatically rebuilds your site whenever you make changes to the code. This allows you to preview your changes in real-time.

The development server provides hot reloading and other helpful features for development. You should see a message in your terminal indicating that the server has started successfully.

## Step 4: Exploring the Project Structure

Now that your Gatsby site is running, let's take a look at the project structure:

```
my-gatsby-site/
├── .cache/           # Gatsby's cache directory (auto-generated)
├── .gitignore        # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
├── gatsby-config.js  # Gatsby configuration file
├── gatsby-node.js    # Gatsby Node API configuration file
├── gatsby-ssr.js     # Gatsby Server-Side Rendering API configuration file
├── gatsby-browser.js # Gatsby Browser API configuration file
├── package-lock.json  # Records the exact versions of dependencies
├── package.json       # Contains project metadata and dependencies
├── src/              # Source code directory
│   ├── components/     # React components
│   ├── pages/          # Pages for your site
│   └── images/         # Images for your site
└── static/         # Static assets like favicons and robots.txt
```

**Key Files and Directories:**

- **`gatsby-config.js`:** This is the main configuration file for your Gatsby site. It's used to configure plugins, set site metadata, and define other global settings.

  ```plaintext
  module.exports = {
    siteMetadata: {
      title: `My Gatsby Site`,
      description: `A simple Gatsby site.`,
      author: `@gatsbyjs`,
    },
    plugins: [
      `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`,
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
        options: {
          name: `images`,
          path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
        },
      },
      `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
      `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-plugin-manifest`,
        options: {
          name: `gatsby-starter-default`,
          short_name: `starter`,
          start_url: `/`,
          background_color: `#663399`,
          theme_color: `#663399`,
          display: `minimal-ui`,
          icon: `src/images/gatsby-icon.png`, // This path is relative to the root of the site.
        },
      },
      // this (optional) plugin enables Progressive Web App + Offline functionality
      // To learn more, visit: https://gatsby.dev/offline
      // `gatsby-plugin-offline`,
    ],
  }
  ```

- **`src/pages/`:** This directory contains the pages for your site. Each `.js` file in this directory automatically becomes a page. For example, `src/pages/index.js` becomes the homepage of your site.

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react'
  import { Link } from 'gatsby'

  import Layout from '../components/layout'
  import Image from '../components/image'
  import SEO from '../components/seo'

  const IndexPage = () => (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title="Home" />
      <h1>Hi people</h1>
      <p>Welcome to your new Gatsby site.</p>
      <p>Now go build something great.</p>
      <div style={{ maxWidth: `300px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}>
        <Image />
      </div>
      <Link to="/page-2/">Go to page 2</Link>
    </Layout>
  )

  export default IndexPage
  ```

- **`src/components/`:** This directory contains reusable React components that you can use throughout your site.

## Step 5: Modifying the Site

Now that you have a basic Gatsby site running, you can start modifying it to your liking. Open the `src/pages/index.js` file and change the text to something else. Save the file, and you should see the changes reflected in your browser almost instantly thanks to hot reloading.

**Adding a New Page:**

To add a new page to your site, simply create a new `.js` file in the `src/pages/` directory. For example, to create a page at `/about`, create a file named `src/pages/about.js` with the following content:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import Layout from '../components/layout'
import SEO from '../components/seo'

const AboutPage = () => (
  <Layout>
    <SEO title="About" />
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>This is the about page.</p>
    <Link to="/">Go back to the homepage</Link>
  </Layout>
)

export default AboutPage
```

Now, you can access the about page by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/about`.

## Step 6: Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your Gatsby site, you need to build it for production. Run the following command:

```plaintext
gatsby build
```

This command will create a `public` directory containing all the static files needed to deploy your site.

**Explanation:**

- `gatsby build`: This command builds your Gatsby site for production. It optimizes the site for performance and creates static files that can be deployed to a web server.

The `public` directory can then be deployed to a web hosting provider such as Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3.
