# Node.js HTTP Status Codes: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

HTTP status codes are an essential part of web development. They are three-digit codes that a server sends back to the client to indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. Understanding and using them correctly in your Node.js applications, especially when building REST APIs, is crucial for creating robust, reliable, and user-friendly experiences. This comprehensive guide dives deep into HTTP status codes in Node.js, providing detailed explanations, practical examples using Express.js, and best practices for implementation.

## What are HTTP Status Codes?

HTTP status codes are categorized into five classes, denoted by their first digit:

- **1xx (Informational):** Indicates that the request was received and understood. These are rarely used directly in application code but are handled by the server.
- **2xx (Success):** Indicates that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- **3xx (Redirection):** Indicates that further action needs to be taken by the client in order to fulfill the request.
- **4xx (Client Error):** Indicates that the client seems to have erred. This could be due to malformed syntax, unauthorized access, or other client-side issues.
- **5xx (Server Error):** Indicates that the server failed to fulfill a request that was apparently valid.

Let's explore some of the most commonly used HTTP status codes in each category and how to implement them in your Node.js applications.

## 2xx Success Status Codes

These status codes indicate that the client's request was successful.

- **200 OK:** The standard response for successful HTTP requests. It signifies that the request was successful and the response contains the requested data.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;
    // Simulate fetching user data from a database
    const user = { id: userId, name: 'John Doe' };

    if (user) {
      res.status(200).json(user); // Returns the user data with a 200 OK status
    } else {
      res.status(404).json({ message: 'User not found' }); // Returns a 404 Not Found if the user is not found
    }
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
  });
  ```

- **201 Created:** Indicates that the request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created. This is commonly used after a successful `POST` request to create a new entity. The `Location` header in the response should contain the URL of the newly created resource.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js
  app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
    const newUser = {
      id: Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15), // Generate a random ID
      name: req.body.name,
      email: req.body.email
    };

    // Simulate saving the user to a database
    // ...save newUser to database...

    res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created successfully', user: newUser });
    // Ideally, you would also set the Location header:
    // res.location(`/users/${newUser.id}`);
  });
  ```

- **204 No Content:** Indicates that the server has successfully fulfilled the request but there is no content to send in the response body. This is often used for `DELETE` requests when the resource is successfully deleted but there is no need to return any further data.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js
  app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;
    // Simulate deleting the user from the database
    // ...delete user from database...

    res.status(204).end(); // Returns a 204 No Content status. `end()` sends the response without a body.
  });
  ```

## 3xx Redirection Status Codes

These status codes indicate that the client needs to take further action to complete the request, typically by redirecting to a different URL.

- **301 Moved Permanently:** Indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. Clients should update their bookmarks and links to the new URL. The `Location` header in the response specifies the new URL.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js
  app.get('/old-resource', (req, res) => {
    res.redirect(301, '/new-resource'); // Redirects to /new-resource with a 301 status
  });
  ```

- **302 Found (Moved Temporarily):** Indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL. Clients should use the new URL for this specific request but continue to use the original URL for future requests. The `Location` header in the response specifies the temporary URL. While historically used for temporary redirects, 307 or 303 are now often preferred depending on the original request method.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js (though 303 or 307 are generally preferred now)
  app.get('/temp-resource', (req, res) => {
    res.redirect(302, '/temporary-location');
  });
  ```

- **304 Not Modified:** Tells the client that the requested resource has not been modified since the last time it was requested. The client can then use the cached version of the resource. This status code is often used with caching mechanisms and `ETag` or `Last-Modified` headers. The server does not send the content of the resource in the response body.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js (simplified)
  app.get('/cached-resource', (req, res) => {
    const etag = 'unique-resource-version'; // Replace with a real ETag
    if (req.headers['if-none-match'] === etag) {
      res.status(304).end(); // Client's cached version is up-to-date
    } else {
      // Serve the resource and include the ETag header
      res.setHeader('ETag', etag);
      res.status(200).send('Resource content');
    }
  });
  ```

## 4xx Client Error Status Codes

These status codes indicate that the client has made an error in the request.

- **400 Bad Request:** Indicates that the server cannot understand the request due to invalid syntax, invalid parameters, or other client-side errors.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js
  app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    if (!req.body.name || !req.body.email) {
      res.status(400).json({ message: 'Name and email are required' });
      return;
    }
    // ... process the data ...
  });
  ```

- **401 Unauthorized:** Indicates that the client is not authorized to access the resource. This status code is usually returned when the client has not provided the necessary authentication credentials. The `WWW-Authenticate` header should be included in the response to specify the authentication scheme.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js (simplified authentication)
  function authenticate(req, res, next) {
    const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key']; // Assuming API key authentication
    if (apiKey === 'valid-api-key') {
      next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    } else {
      res.status(401).set('WWW-Authenticate', 'APIKey').json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
    }
  }

  app.get('/protected-resource', authenticate, (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Access granted' });
  });
  ```

- **403 Forbidden:** Indicates that the client is not allowed to access the resource, even if they are authenticated. This could be due to insufficient permissions or other restrictions.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js (simplified authorization)
  function authorize(req, res, next) {
    // Assume user has a 'role' property
    if (req.user && req.user.role === 'admin') {
      next(); // Admin user can access the resource
    } else {
      res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
    }
  }

  app.get('/admin-resource', authenticate, authorize, (req, res) => { // Requires authentication AND authorization
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Admin resource' });
  });
  ```

- **404 Not Found:** Indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. This is a common error that occurs when the client tries to access a non-existent URL.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js (already shown in 200 OK example)
  app.get('/non-existent-resource', (req, res) => {
      res.status(404).json({ message: 'Resource not found' });
  });
  ```

- **405 Method Not Allowed:** Indicates that the method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource identified by the URL. For example, trying to `POST` to a resource that only allows `GET` requests.

  ```plaintext
  app.post('/readonly-resource', (req, res) => {
    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method Not Allowed' });
  });

  app.get('/readonly-resource', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send('This resource is read-only and only allows GET requests.');
  });
  ```

- **409 Conflict:** Indicates that the request could not be completed due to a conflict in the current state of the resource. This often occurs when attempting to create a resource with the same unique identifier as an existing resource.

  ```plaintext
  app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
    // Simulate checking if a user with the same email already exists
    const emailExists = true; // Replace with actual database check

    if (emailExists) {
      res.status(409).json({ message: 'Email already exists' });
    } else {
      // ... create the user ...
      res.status(201).json({ message: 'User created successfully' });
    }
  });
  ```

## 5xx Server Error Status Codes

These status codes indicate that the server encountered an error while trying to fulfill the request.

- **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message that indicates that something went wrong on the server side. This is often a result of unhandled exceptions or other unexpected errors. It's crucial to log these errors on the server for debugging purposes.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js
  app.get('/error-route', (req, res) => {
    try {
      // Simulate an error
      throw new Error('Something went wrong');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error); // Log the error on the server
      res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
    }
  });

  // Global error handler in Express.js
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
  });
  ```

- **502 Bad Gateway:** Indicates that the server, acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from another server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request. This often happens when one server is temporarily unavailable or returning errors.

  ```plaintext
  //  Not directly implementable without involving another service/server to simulate a bad response
  //  This code snippet shows how you might handle this if you're making requests to an external service
  const axios = require('axios');

  app.get('/proxy-request', async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api');
      res.status(200).json(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      // Check if the error is due to a bad gateway
      if (error.response && error.response.status === 502) {
        res.status(502).json({ message: 'Bad Gateway: Error from upstream server' });
      } else {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
      }
    }
  });
  ```

- **503 Service Unavailable:** Indicates that the server is temporarily unable to handle the request. This could be due to maintenance, overload, or other temporary issues. The `Retry-After` header can be included in the response to indicate how long the client should wait before retrying the request.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Express.js
  app.get('/unavailable', (req, res) => {
    res.status(503).set('Retry-After', '300').json({ message: 'Service Unavailable - Try again in 5 minutes' });
  });
  ```

- **504 Gateway Timeout:** Indicates that the server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from another server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request. This often happens when a downstream server is slow or unavailable.

  ```plaintext
  // Similar to 502, requires interacting with another service to trigger
  // This example shows how to handle it if an upstream request times out
  const axios = require('axios');

  app.get('/proxy-request-timeout', async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('https://slow-service.com/api', { timeout: 2000 }); // Set a timeout
      res.status(200).json(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      if (error.code === 'ECONNABORTED') { //  `ECONNABORTED`  indicates a request timeout
        res.status(504).json({ message: 'Gateway Timeout: Upstream server took too long to respond' });
      } else {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
      }
    }
  });
  ```

## Best Practices for Using HTTP Status Codes in Node.js

- **Use meaningful status codes:** Choose the most appropriate status code to accurately reflect the outcome of the request. Avoid using generic status codes like 200 OK for all responses.
- **Provide informative error messages:** Include helpful error messages in the response body to provide more context to the client about why the request failed.
- **Handle errors gracefully:** Implement proper error handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions on the server side. Log errors for debugging purposes and return appropriate error status codes to the client.
- **Use a consistent API design:** Maintain a consistent API design across your application, using standard HTTP status codes and response formats.
- **Document your API:** Clearly document the HTTP status codes that your API uses for each endpoint.
- **Consider using middleware for error handling:** Express.js middleware can be used to centralize error handling logic and ensure consistency across your application.

## Conclusion

Understanding and using HTTP status codes correctly is essential for building robust and reliable Node.js applications, especially when creating REST APIs. By using the appropriate status codes, providing informative error messages, and implementing proper error handling, you can create a better experience for your users and make your applications easier to debug and maintain. This guide provides a solid foundation for effectively using HTTP status codes in your Node.js projects. Remember to consult the official HTTP specifications for a complete list of status codes and their meanings.
