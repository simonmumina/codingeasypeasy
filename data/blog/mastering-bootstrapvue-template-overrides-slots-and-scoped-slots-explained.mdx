# Mastering BootstrapVue Template Overrides: Slots and Scoped Slots Explained

BootstrapVue provides a robust set of pre-built Vue.js components based on the popular Bootstrap framework.  While these components offer a great starting point, sometimes you need to customize their appearance or functionality to better fit your application's needs.  One of the most powerful ways to achieve this is by using **slots** and **scoped slots**. This blog post will dive deep into how to override BootstrapVue component templates with slots and scoped slots, giving you the flexibility to create truly unique and tailored user interfaces.

## What are Slots in Vue.js and BootstrapVue?

Slots are a Vue.js feature that allows you to inject custom content into a component's template. Think of them as placeholders where you can insert your own HTML, Vue components, or even dynamic content. BootstrapVue heavily utilizes slots in its components, providing ample opportunities for customization.

There are three main types of slots:

*   **Default Slot:**  The default slot is the unnamed slot.  Any content you pass inside the component tags without specifying a slot name will be rendered within the default slot.

*   **Named Slots:**  Named slots allow you to target specific areas within a component's template. Each named slot has a unique name, and you use the `v-slot` directive (or the shorthand `#`) to inject content into that specific slot.

*   **Scoped Slots:**  Scoped slots are named slots that provide data to the slot content. This data is passed as props to the slot, allowing you to create dynamic and context-aware templates.

## Why Override BootstrapVue Templates?

Overriding BootstrapVue templates through slots and scoped slots offers several advantages:

*   **Customization:**  Tailor the look and feel of BootstrapVue components to match your design system.
*   **Flexibility:**  Add or remove elements, change styling, or inject custom functionality without modifying the BootstrapVue library itself.
*   **Reusability:**  Create reusable overrides for different parts of your application.
*   **Maintainability:** Avoid "ejecting" or forking the component to make changes which makes it easier to upgrade versions of the framework without conflicts.

## Using Default Slots

Let's start with the simplest case: the default slot.  Consider a `BButton` component:

```vue
<template>
  <b-button variant="primary">
    Click Me!
  </b-button>
</template>
```

In this example, "Click Me!" is passed into the default slot of the `BButton` component.  The `BButton` component defines a region where this text will be rendered (usually inside the button).

Now, let's override this.  Suppose you want to add an icon before the text:

```vue
<template>
  <b-button variant="primary">
    <font-awesome-icon icon="fa-solid fa-thumbs-up" class="mr-2"/>
    Click Me!
  </b-button>
</template>

<script>
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome'
import { faThumbsUp } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

export default {
  components: {
    FontAwesomeIcon
  },
  mounted() {
    // Import fontawesome icons
    import("@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core/styles.css");
  },
  setup() {
    return {
      faThumbsUp
    };
  }
}
</script>

<style scoped>
/* scoped styling example */
.mr-2 {
  margin-right: 0.5rem;
}
</style>
```

In this case, the `<font-awesome-icon>` element is also passed into the default slot. BootstrapVue's `BButton` component is designed to render everything inside the default slot, so your icon will appear alongside the text.

## Leveraging Named Slots

Named slots provide more precise control over where your content is injected. Let's consider a hypothetical `CustomTable` component (this is *not* a direct BootstrapVue component, but illustrates the concept well.  BootstrapVue's `BTable` component provides similar slot functionality).

```vue
<!-- CustomTable.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="table-container">
    <div class="table-header">
      <slot name="header"></slot>
    </div>
    <div class="table-body">
      <slot></slot> <!-- Default slot for rows -->
    </div>
    <div class="table-footer">
      <slot name="footer"></slot>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

This `CustomTable` component has three slots: `header`, the default slot (for table rows), and `footer`.  To use these slots, you use the `v-slot` directive (or the shorthand `#`):

```vue
<template>
  <custom-table>
    <template v-slot:header>
      <h1>My Custom Table</h1>
    </template>

    <tr>
      <td>Data 1</td>
      <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data 3</td>
      <td>Data 4</td>
    </tr>

    <template #footer>
      <p>Copyright 2024</p>
    </template>
  </custom-table>
</template>

<script>
import CustomTable from './CustomTable.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    CustomTable
  }
}
</script>
```

*   `v-slot:header` injects the `<h1>` tag into the `header` slot of `CustomTable`.
*   The `<tr>` elements are injected into the default slot, which represents the table body.
*   `#footer` (shorthand for `v-slot:footer`) injects the `<p>` tag into the `footer` slot.

Using named slots provides much cleaner template code and allows you to target specific areas within the component.

## Unleashing the Power of Scoped Slots

Scoped slots are the most powerful type of slot because they allow the component to pass data to the slot content. This enables you to create dynamic and context-aware templates.  Let's revisit the `BTable` component from BootstrapVue and consider its `head()` scoped slot (it also provides other slots).

The `BTable` component doesn't directly provide a `head()` slot, but imagine you *extended* it to do so for more flexibility in the header. This allows a custom header, especially when used alongside items array as data source. This shows an example of how you can even *add* to the customization using a new slot in a wrapper component!

```vue
// CustomTableWrapper.vue
<template>
  <b-table :items="items" :fields="fields">
    <template #head="data">
      <tr>
        <th v-for="field in data.fields" :key="field.key">
          <slot name="headCell" :field="field">{{ field.label }}</slot>
        </th>
      </tr>
    </template>

    <template #cell(name)="data">
      {{ data.value.toUpperCase() }}
    </template>
  </b-table>
</template>

<script>
import { BTable } from 'bootstrap-vue';

export default {
  components: {
    BTable
  },
  data() {
    return {
      fields: [
        { key: 'id', label: 'ID' },
        { key: 'name', label: 'Name' },
        { key: 'age', label: 'Age' }
      ],
      items: [
        { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 30 },
        { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', age: 25 },
        { id: 3, name: 'Peter Jones', age: 40 }
      ]
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **`#head="data"`:** This defines a scoped slot named `head`.  The `data` object is passed as a prop to the slot. This data object will contain all data related to the headers. We'll assume `fields` is available in this slot, for our example.
2.  **`data.fields`:** Inside the slot, we can access the `fields` array passed by the `CustomTableWrapper` component. This array contains information about each column, such as its key and label.
3.  **`field.label`:** We use `field.label` to display the column header label.

Now, let's use the `head` slot to customize the header:

```vue
<template>
  <custom-table-wrapper>
    <template #headCell="{ field }">
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">{{ field.label }}</span>
    </template>
  </custom-table-wrapper>
</template>

<script>
import CustomTableWrapper from './CustomTableWrapper.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    CustomTableWrapper
  }
}
</script>
```

In this example:

*   We are using `#headCell="{ field }"`. Notice that destructuring `{ field }` will assign just the field.
*   We are wrapping each `field.label` with a `<span>` tag with inline styling to make it bold and blue.

This demonstrates how scoped slots allow you to access data from the component and use it to dynamically render the slot content.

## Real-World Examples with BootstrapVue Components

Let's look at some practical examples using actual BootstrapVue components.

### Customizing `BModal`

The `BModal` component offers several slots, including:

*   `modal-header`
*   `modal-title`
*   `modal-body`
*   `modal-footer`

You can use these slots to completely customize the appearance and behavior of the modal. For instance:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button @click="showModal">Show Modal</b-button>
    <b-modal id="my-modal" ref="myModal" title="My Custom Modal" @hidden="resetModal">
        <template #modal-header="{ close }">
          <h5 class="modal-title">Custom Header</h5>
          <b-button variant="outline-secondary" size="sm" @click="close()">
            Close
          </b-button>
        </template>

      <p class="my-4">Hello from my custom modal!</p>
      <template #modal-footer="{ ok, cancel, close }">
        <b-button variant="primary" @click="ok()">OK</b-button>
        <b-button variant="secondary" @click="cancel()">Cancel</b-button>
      </template>
    </b-modal>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { BButton, BModal } from 'bootstrap-vue';

export default {
  components: {
    BButton,
    BModal
  },
  methods: {
    showModal() {
      this.$refs.myModal.show()
    },
    resetModal() {
      // Handle actions after modal close, such as cleaning form data
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

This code overrides the `modal-header` and `modal-footer` slots to use custom buttons and heading.  Note the `close`, `ok`, and `cancel` functions that are passed via the slot's scope!

### Customizing `BTable`

As shown earlier, the `BTable` component provides many slots (primarily through events and data manipulation, although you could *extend* it as in the earlier example) that allow you to customize how data is displayed.

```vue
<template>
  <b-table :items="items" :fields="fields">
    <template #cell(age)="data">
      {{ data.value }} years old
    </template>
  </b-table>
</template>

<script>
import { BTable } from 'bootstrap-vue';

export default {
  components: {
    BTable
  },
  data() {
    return {
      fields: [
        { key: 'name', label: 'Name' },
        { key: 'age', label: 'Age' }
      ],
      items: [
        { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 },
        { name: 'Jane Smith', age: 25 }
      ]
    };
  }
}
</script>
```

Here, the `#cell(age)="data"` slot overrides the cell content for the `age` column.  The `data` object contains the value of the cell (`data.value`) and other useful information.

## Best Practices for Template Overrides

*   **Understand the Component Structure:** Before overriding a template, thoroughly understand the component's structure and the available slots. Consult the BootstrapVue documentation for details.
*   **Use Specific Slot Names:** Always use named slots when available for better clarity and maintainability.
*   **Avoid Overly Complex Logic in Slots:** Keep the logic inside slots simple and focused on presentation. For more complex logic, consider creating separate Vue components and injecting them into the slots.
*   **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure that your template overrides align with your application's overall design and style guidelines.
*   **Document Your Overrides:** Clearly document any template overrides to make it easier for other developers (and your future self) to understand and maintain the code.
*   **Be Mindful of Updates:** Check your overrides after BootstrapVue updates to ensure they still work correctly. The component's internal structure may have changed.
*   **CSS Scoping:** Use scoped CSS within the components that override slots. This will ensure that your styles do not accidentally affect other parts of your application.

## Conclusion

Overriding BootstrapVue component templates with slots and scoped slots is a powerful technique for customizing the look and feel of your application. By understanding the different types of slots and how to use them effectively, you can create truly unique and tailored user interfaces while still leveraging the power and convenience of the BootstrapVue library.  Experiment with these techniques and unlock the full potential of BootstrapVue in your Vue.js projects! Remember to consult the official BootstrapVue documentation for detailed information on each component and its available slots.
