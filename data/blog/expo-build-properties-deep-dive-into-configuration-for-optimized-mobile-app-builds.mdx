# Expo Build Properties: Deep Dive into Configuration for Optimized Mobile App Builds

Building robust and efficient mobile applications with Expo involves more than just writing great React Native code. Optimizing your build process for different environments, platforms (Android and iOS), and build targets is crucial for delivering a seamless user experience, enhancing security, and streamlining deployment. Enter `expo-build-properties`, a powerful tool that empowers you to fine-tune your app's build configurations directly within your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

This comprehensive guide will delve deep into the capabilities of `expo-build-properties`, covering everything from basic setup to advanced configuration techniques. We'll explore how to use build properties to:

- Customize your app's behavior based on environment (development, staging, production).
- Optimize your app for specific Android and iOS devices.
- Manage security-sensitive data during the build process.
- Improve build performance.
- Tailor your app for different release channels.

Let's get started!

## What are Expo Build Properties?

`expo-build-properties` is an Expo plugin that allows you to inject platform-specific configuration settings directly into your Android and iOS builds. These settings, defined in your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file, are translated into native build configurations, giving you granular control over various aspects of your application. This means you can modify things like:

- **Android:** `AndroidManifest.xml` attributes, `build.gradle` dependencies, permissions, and more.
- **iOS:** `Info.plist` entries, build settings, entitlements, and more.

The primary benefit of using `expo-build-properties` is that it allows you to manage your build configurations declaratively within your JavaScript codebase, making them easier to understand, maintain, and version control. It eliminates the need for manual modifications to native build files, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Install the package:**

    ```plaintext
    npx expo install expo-build-properties
    ```

2.  **Configure the plugin in your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:**

    Add the `expo-build-properties` plugin to the `plugins` array in your Expo configuration file. For example:

    ```javascript
    // app.config.js or app.json
    export default {
      expo: {
        name: 'MyApp',
        slug: 'myapp',
        version: '1.0.0',
        plugins: [
          [
            'expo-build-properties',
            {
              android: {
                compileSdkVersion: 33,
                targetSdkVersion: 33,
                buildToolsVersion: '33.0.0',
                kotlinVersion: '1.8.0', // Minimum Kotlin version
                minSdkVersion: 24,
                packagingOptions: {
                  exclude: ['/lib/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so'], // example exclusion
                },
                // Customize AndroidManifest.xml
                manifest: {
                  application: {
                    usesCleartextTraffic: false, // Example setting
                  },
                  usesPermissions: [
                    'android.permission.CAMERA',
                    'android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION',
                  ],
                },
                // Custom Gradle Properties
                gradleProperties: {
                  'android.useAndroidX': 'true',
                  'android.enableJetifier': 'true',
                },
              },
              ios: {
                deploymentTarget: '13.0',
                flipper: false, // Disable Flipper for release builds
                infoPlist: {
                  // Customize Info.plist
                  UIBackgroundModes: ['location', 'fetch'], // Example background modes
                  NSCameraUsageDescription: 'This app needs access to your camera to take photos.',
                  NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription:
                    'We use your location to provide better services.',
                },
                //Customize entitlements file
                entitlements: {
                  'com.apple.developer.applesignin': ['Default'],
                },
              },
            },
          ],
        ],
      },
    }
    ```

    **Important:** The plugin configuration should be structured under the `plugins` array within the `expo` object.

3.  **Rebuild your app with EAS Build:**

    After configuring the plugin, you need to rebuild your app using EAS Build for the changes to take effect.

    ```plaintext
    eas build -p android --profile development  # Build for Android development
    eas build -p ios --profile development      # Build for iOS development
    ```

    Replace `development` with your desired build profile (e.g., `production`, `staging`).

## Core Configuration Options

Let's break down the core configuration options available within `expo-build-properties`:

### Android Configuration (`android` object)

The `android` object allows you to configure various aspects of your Android build. Here are some common options:

- **`compileSdkVersion`**: The Android API level to compile against. This should typically be the latest stable API level.
- **`targetSdkVersion`**: The Android API level that your app is designed to run on. It's recommended to target a recent API level to ensure compatibility with newer Android features and security updates.
- **`buildToolsVersion`**: The version of the Android build tools to use.
- **`minSdkVersion`**: The minimum Android API level supported by your app. Setting this too low can lead to compatibility issues with modern devices and features.
- **`kotlinVersion`**: (Recommended to add) Specify the Kotlin version for your project.
- **`packagingOptions`**: Allows you to customize how resources and libraries are packaged within your APK. This is useful for excluding specific files or libraries that might cause conflicts or increase the APK size unnecessarily.

  ```javascript
  packagingOptions: {
    exclude: ['/lib/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so'],
    pickFirst: ['META-INF/LICENSE.txt'], // Prefer a specific license file
  },
  ```

- **`manifest`**: Provides direct access to modify elements within your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This allows you to configure permissions, application settings, and other crucial app metadata.

  ```javascript
  manifest: {
    application: {
      usesCleartextTraffic: false, // Enforce HTTPS for security
      networkSecurityConfig: '@xml/network_security_config', // Custom network security config
    },
    usesPermissions: [
      'android.permission.CAMERA',
      'android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION',
    ],
    queries: [
        { intents: [
            { action: "android.intent.action.VIEW", data: { scheme: "https" }}
        ]}
      ]
  },
  ```

  **Important**: Avoid overriding core attributes used by Expo. Use the appropriate Expo configuration when possible (e.g., `android.package` for the package name).

- **`gradleProperties`**: Allows you to define custom properties that are injected into your `gradle.properties` file. This is useful for configuring build settings, dependency versions, and other Gradle-related configurations.

  ```javascript
  gradleProperties: {
    'android.useAndroidX': 'true',
    'android.enableJetifier': 'true',
    'kotlin.incremental': 'true', // Enable incremental Kotlin compilation
  },
  ```

- **`proguardDebugFiles`**: An array of Proguard configuration files used for shrinking and obfuscating your code in debug builds. Generally only relevant for advanced use cases requiring very specific debug obfuscation.
- **`proguardReleaseFiles`**: An array of Proguard configuration files used for shrinking and obfuscating your code in release builds. These are used to make reverse engineering more difficult and can significantly reduce your APK size. It is usually required for production builds.

  ```javascript
   proguardReleaseFiles: ['./proguard-rules.pro'],
  ```

### iOS Configuration (`ios` object)

The `ios` object lets you configure your iOS build. Some key options include:

- **`deploymentTarget`**: The minimum iOS version supported by your app. Similar to `minSdkVersion` for Android, setting this too low can lead to issues with newer devices and features.
- **`flipper`**: A boolean to enable/disable Flipper integration (a debugging platform). It's generally recommended to disable Flipper for release builds to improve performance.
- **`infoPlist`**: Provides access to modify entries within your `Info.plist` file, which contains essential metadata about your iOS app.

  ```javascript
  infoPlist: {
    UIBackgroundModes: ['location', 'fetch'], // Enable background location updates and background fetch
    NSCameraUsageDescription: 'This app needs access to your camera to take photos.',
    CFBundleURLTypes: [ // Define custom URL schemes for deep linking
      {
        CFBundleURLSchemes: ['myapp'],
      },
    ],
    ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false, // If you don't use encryption
  },
  ```

  **Important**: Be mindful of the privacy descriptions required for certain iOS features (e.g., camera, location, microphone). Ensure you provide clear and concise explanations to the user.

- **`entitlements`**: Allows you to configure entitlements, which grant your app specific permissions and capabilities. This is crucial for enabling features like push notifications, iCloud integration, and access to protected resources.

  ```javascript
  entitlements: {
    'aps-environment': 'production', // Enable push notifications (production environment)
    'com.apple.developer.icloud-container-environment': 'Production', // Enable iCloud
    "com.apple.developer.applesignin": ["Default"]
  },
  ```

- **`buildSettings`**: Use this to modify the underlying build system flags used by Xcode during compilation. This allows fine-grained control over compilation flags, linker flags, and other low-level settings.

  ```javascript
  buildSettings: {
      ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES: 'YES',
      CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES: 'YES',
      SWIFT_VERSION: '5.0',
  }
  ```

## Conditional Configuration with Environment Variables

One of the most powerful features of `expo-build-properties` is the ability to configure your app based on the environment. This is typically achieved using environment variables.

1.  **Define Environment Variables:**

    You can define environment variables using `.env` files or by setting them directly in your shell environment (e.g., in your CI/CD pipeline).

    ```plaintext
    # .env.production
    API_URL=https://api.example.com/production
    ```

    ```plaintext
    # .env.development
    API_URL=https://api.example.com/development
    ```

2.  **Access Environment Variables in `app.config.js`:**

    You can access environment variables using `process.env`. Remember to install `dotenv` if you want to use `.env` files.

    ```plaintext
     npx expo install dotenv
    ```

    ```javascript
    // app.config.js
    import 'dotenv/config' // Import dotenv

    export default ({ config }) => {
      return {
        ...config,
        extra: {
          apiUrl: process.env.API_URL,
        },
        plugins: [
          [
            'expo-build-properties',
            {
              android: {
                manifest: {
                  application: {
                    debuggable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development', // Enable debugging in development
                  },
                },
              },
              ios: {
                infoPlist: {
                  API_URL: process.env.API_URL, // Pass the API URL to Info.plist
                },
              },
            },
          ],
        ],
      }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - We use `process.env.API_URL` to access the value of the `API_URL` environment variable.
    - We set `android.manifest.application.debuggable` to `true` only when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to `development`.
    - We pass the `API_URL` to the iOS `Info.plist` as a custom key. You can then access this value in your native iOS code.

3.  **Using `extra` to Access at Runtime**

    As shown in the code block above, use the `extra` field inside `app.config.js` to define variables that can be accessed at runtime from the app.

    ```javascript
    import Constants from 'expo-constants'

    // Access the API URL in your React Native code
    const apiUrl = Constants.manifest?.extra?.apiUrl
    console.log('API URL:', apiUrl)
    ```

## Advanced Configuration Techniques

### Modifying Dependencies (Android)

You can add or modify dependencies in your Android `build.gradle` file using a more advanced technique involving custom Gradle scripts. This is less common but can be useful for highly customized builds.

1.  **Create a Custom Gradle Script:**

    Create a Gradle script (e.g., `android/app/build.gradle.kts`) that modifies the dependencies.

    ```kotlin
    // android/app/build.gradle.kts
    dependencies {
        implementation("com.example:mylibrary:1.0.0")
    }
    ```

2.  **Reference the Script in `app.json`:**

    Use the `android.buildGradleInclude` property to include your custom Gradle script. Note this configuration requires the usage of EAS build and ejecting is not supported!

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "android": {
          "buildGradleInclude": ":expo-module-template:react-native-plugin"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Using `expo-constants`

The `expo-constants` package provides access to various build-time constants and environment information. You can use it in conjunction with `expo-build-properties` to further customize your builds.

```javascript
import Constants from 'expo-constants'

export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    extra: {
      buildNumber:
        Constants.expoConfig?.ios?.buildNumber || Constants.expoConfig?.android?.versionCode || '1',
      appVersion: Constants.expoConfig?.version || '1.0.0',
    },
    plugins: [
      [
        'expo-build-properties',
        {
          ios: {
            infoPlist: {
              CFBundleVersion: Constants.expoConfig?.ios?.buildNumber || '1', // Get build number
              CFBundleShortVersionString: Constants.expoConfig?.version || '1.0.0', // Get short version string
            },
          },
          android: {
            manifest: {
              application: {
                '@android:versionCode': Constants.expoConfig?.android?.versionCode,
                '@android:versionName': Constants.expoConfig?.version,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    ],
  }
}
```

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Keep your configuration clean and organized:** As your app grows, your `app.json` or `app.config.js` can become complex. Use comments and clear naming conventions to maintain readability.
- **Avoid hardcoding sensitive information:** Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information directly in your configuration files. Use environment variables and secure storage mechanisms.
- **Test your builds thoroughly:** Always test your builds on different devices and platforms to ensure that your configurations are working as expected.
- **Use EAS Build profiles:** Leverage EAS Build profiles to manage different build configurations for various environments (development, staging, production). This helps to avoid accidental deployment of development configurations to production.
- **Be aware of platform-specific limitations:** Some build properties might be specific to either Android or iOS. Consult the official `expo-build-properties` documentation for the latest information.

## Troubleshooting

- **Changes not taking effect:** Ensure that you have rebuilt your app using EAS Build after modifying your configuration. Also, double-check that your plugin configuration is correctly structured in `app.json` or `app.config.js`.
- **Build errors:** Carefully review the error messages to identify the source of the problem. Common causes include incorrect syntax in your configuration, invalid values for build properties, or conflicts with other plugins.
- **Native build issues:** If you encounter native build issues, you might need to consult the Android or iOS documentation for more information about the specific build settings you are trying to configure.
- **Check the Expo Go Compatibility:** Certain build properties may affect the Expo Go client. Always test the configurations on emulators or real devices before creating a production release.

## Conclusion

`expo-build-properties` is a valuable tool for any Expo developer looking to optimize their mobile app builds. By understanding the available configuration options and best practices, you can tailor your app for specific environments, platforms, and build targets, resulting in improved performance, security, and deployment efficiency. Experiment with the different features of `expo-build-properties` to discover the optimal configuration for your app's needs. Keep an eye on the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-build-properties) for any updates and new features. Happy building!
