<head>
  <title>Meteor Example</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Meteor!</h1>
  {{> hello}}
</body>

<template name="hello">
  <button>Click Me</button>
  <p>You've pressed the button {{counter}} times.</p>
</template>
```

```plaintext
// client/main.js
import { Template } from 'meteor/templating'
import { ReactiveVar } from 'meteor/reactive-var'

import './main.html'

Template.hello.onCreated(function helloOnCreated() {
  // counter starts at 0
  this.counter = new ReactiveVar(0)
})

Template.hello.helpers({
  counter() {
    return Template.instance().counter.get()
  },
})

Template.hello.events({
  'click button'(event, instance) {
    // increment the counter when button is clicked
    instance.counter.set(instance.counter.get() + 1)
  },
})
```
