# Reduce BootstrapVue CSS Size: PurgeCSS for Smaller Bundles and Faster Websites

BootstrapVue is a fantastic library for building responsive and accessible Vue.js applications. However, like any CSS framework, it comes with a lot of pre-built styles.  Often, your application only utilizes a small subset of these styles.  This can lead to bloated CSS files, impacting page load times and overall website performance. This blog post will guide you through integrating PurgeCSS with BootstrapVue to eliminate unused CSS, resulting in smaller CSS bundles and a faster, more efficient website.

## Why Use PurgeCSS?

PurgeCSS analyzes your project files (HTML, JavaScript, Vue components, etc.) and identifies CSS rules that are *actually* used. It then removes any CSS rules that aren't found to be necessary. This process can dramatically reduce the size of your CSS files, leading to:

*   **Faster Page Load Times:** Smaller CSS files mean less data for the browser to download, resulting in faster initial page rendering.
*   **Improved Website Performance:** Reduced CSS size contributes to a lighter overall payload, leading to a snappier user experience.
*   **Better SEO:** Search engines favor websites with faster loading times, potentially boosting your search ranking.
*   **Reduced Hosting Costs:** While often negligible, smaller file sizes can translate to lower bandwidth usage.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **A Vue.js project:** This guide assumes you already have a Vue.js project set up.
*   **BootstrapVue installed:**  Your project should be using BootstrapVue.  If not, install it using:

    ```bash
    npm install bootstrap-vue bootstrap
    # or
    yarn add bootstrap-vue bootstrap
    ```

*   **A Package Manager:** (npm or yarn)

## Step-by-Step Guide to Integrating PurgeCSS with BootstrapVue

Here's a detailed breakdown of how to integrate PurgeCSS into your project. We'll cover different approaches based on your build system (Webpack).

**1. Install PurgeCSS**

Install PurgeCSS as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install -D purgecss-webpack-plugin glob-all
# or
yarn add -D purgecss-webpack-plugin glob-all
```

*   `purgecss-webpack-plugin`:  A webpack plugin specifically designed to integrate PurgeCSS into your webpack build process.
*   `glob-all`: Used for creating flexible file patterns for PurgeCSS to scan.

**2. Configure PurgeCSS in webpack.config.js**

This is the core of the integration.  We'll configure `purgecss-webpack-plugin` within your `webpack.config.js` file.  If you're using Vue CLI, you might need to eject or modify your webpack configuration using `vue.config.js`. Let's assume we're directly modifying `webpack.config.js` for clarity.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

const glob = require('glob-all');
const PurgeCSSPlugin = require('purgecss-webpack-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ... other webpack configurations ...

  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins ...
    new PurgeCSSPlugin({
      paths: glob.sync([
        path.join(__dirname, './src/**/*.vue'),
        path.join(__dirname, './src/**/*.js'),
        path.join(__dirname, './public/**/*.html') // Include your index.html (important!)
      ]),
      safelist: {
        standard: [
          'body', // Ensure body styles are not removed
          'html', // Ensure html styles are not removed
          /^fade/, // Preserve fade animations (BootstrapVue)
          /^collapse/, // Preserve collapse animations (BootstrapVue)
          /^show/, // Preserve show class (BootstrapVue)
          /^modal/, // Preserve modal styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^carousel/, // Preserve carousel styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^slide/, // Preserve slide animations (BootstrapVue)
          /^alert/, // Preserve alert styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^dropdown/, // Preserve dropdown styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^nav/, // Preserve nav styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^table/, // Preserve table styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^form/, // Preserve form styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^row/, // Preserve row styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^col/, // Preserve col styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^container/, // Preserve container styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^list-group/, // Preserve list-group styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^badge/, // Preserve badge styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^btn/, // Preserve button styles (BootstrapVue)
          /^card/, // Preserve card styles (BootstrapVue)
        ],
        greedy: [], // Regexes to always keep. (Empty by default)
        keyframes: true,  // Retain unused keyframes
      },
      only: ['app'], // Consider CSS in the 'app' chunk
      extractors: [
        {
          extractor: content => content.match(/[\w-/:]+(?<!:)/g) || [],
          extensions: ['vue', 'js', 'html'],
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
};
```

**Explanation of the Configuration:**

*   **`paths`:** This is the most critical part. It tells PurgeCSS where to look for CSS class names.  We're specifying:
    *   `./src/**/*.vue`:  All Vue components in your `src` directory.
    *   `./src/**/*.js`:  All JavaScript files in your `src` directory (if you use CSS class names in JavaScript).
    *   `./public/**/*.html`:  Your main `index.html` file (or any other HTML files). *This is very important to include!*
*   **`safelist`:** This option allows you to prevent PurgeCSS from removing certain CSS classes, even if they aren't directly found in your files. This is essential for BootstrapVue because some styles are dynamically added or managed by JavaScript. The `standard` array contains a list of CSS class prefixes and complete class names that should always be kept. Adjust this list based on the BootstrapVue components you are using.
    *  **Why the `safelist` is important:** BootstrapVue uses JavaScript to toggle CSS classes for things like modals, dropdowns, and animations.  If you don't safelist these, they'll be removed, and your components will break.
    *   **Use Regular Expressions:**  The `safelist` also supports regular expressions.  Using `/^fade/` ensures that *any* class starting with "fade" (e.g., `fade`, `fade-in`, `fade-out`) is preserved.  This is useful for animation classes.
*   **`only`:** This restricts PurgeCSS to only process CSS within a specific webpack chunk.  Adjust this based on your webpack configuration and where your CSS is being generated (e.g., `app`, `main`, `style`).
*   **`extractors`:** Specifies how PurgeCSS extracts class names from your files.  The default extractor is generally sufficient, but you can customize it if needed.
*   **`keyframes: true`**:  Keeps any unused `@keyframes` rules that might be used by animations.

**3. Vue CLI Integration (vue.config.js)**

If you're using Vue CLI, you need to modify your `vue.config.js` file to configure PurgeCSS. You'll need to use `chainWebpack` for this:

```javascript
// vue.config.js
const glob = require('glob-all');
const PurgeCSSPlugin = require('purgecss-webpack-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  configureWebpack: (config) => {
    config.plugins.push(
      new PurgeCSSPlugin({
        paths: glob.sync([
          path.join(__dirname, './src/**/*.vue'),
          path.join(__dirname, './src/**/*.js'),
          path.join(__dirname, './public/**/*.html')
        ]),
        safelist: {
          standard: [
            'body', // Ensure body styles are not removed
            'html', // Ensure html styles are not removed
            /^fade/, // Preserve fade animations (BootstrapVue)
            /^collapse/, // Preserve collapse animations (BootstrapVue)
            /^show/, // Preserve show class (BootstrapVue)
            /^modal/, // Preserve modal styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^carousel/, // Preserve carousel styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^slide/, // Preserve slide animations (BootstrapVue)
            /^alert/, // Preserve alert styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^dropdown/, // Preserve dropdown styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^nav/, // Preserve nav styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^table/, // Preserve table styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^form/, // Preserve form styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^row/, // Preserve row styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^col/, // Preserve col styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^container/, // Preserve container styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^list-group/, // Preserve list-group styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^badge/, // Preserve badge styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^btn/, // Preserve button styles (BootstrapVue)
            /^card/, // Preserve card styles (BootstrapVue)
          ],
          greedy: [], // Regexes to always keep. (Empty by default)
          keyframes: true,
        },
        only: ['app'], // Consider CSS in the 'app' chunk
        extractors: [
          {
            extractor: content => content.match(/[\w-/:]+(?<!:)/g) || [],
            extensions: ['vue', 'js', 'html'],
          },
        ],
      })
    );
  },
}
```

**4.  Important: Add `/* purgecss start ignore */` and `/* purgecss end ignore */` to your CSS/Sass/SCSS files.**

Sometimes PurgeCSS might remove styles that are necessary because it can't detect them.  A good practice is to wrap any code in your CSS files that MUST be included, regardless of whether it's detected as used, with special comments:

```css
/* purgecss start ignore */
.my-important-class {
  color: red;
}
/* purgecss end ignore */
```

This tells PurgeCSS to ignore the code within these comments and always keep it.

**5. Run Your Build**

Now, run your production build command (e.g., `npm run build` or `yarn build`). PurgeCSS will process your CSS files during the build process.

**6. Verify the Results**

After the build completes, check the size of your CSS files in the `dist` directory (or your configured output directory).  You should see a significant reduction in size.  Also, carefully test your application to ensure that no styles have been unintentionally removed.  If you find any missing styles, adjust your `safelist` or add the ignore comments accordingly.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

*   **Test Thoroughly:**  After integrating PurgeCSS, thoroughly test all parts of your application to ensure that no styles are missing. Pay close attention to interactive elements like modals, dropdowns, and animations.
*   **Inspect Your CSS:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the generated CSS and verify that only the necessary styles are included.
*   **Adjust `safelist` Carefully:**  The `safelist` is your primary tool for preventing accidental style removal.  Add only the necessary classes and prefixes.  Overly broad safelists can defeat the purpose of PurgeCSS.
*   **Consider Environment-Specific Configuration:**  You might want to only enable PurgeCSS in your production environment.  You can achieve this by using environment variables in your `webpack.config.js` or `vue.config.js`.

    ```javascript
    // vue.config.js (Example)

    const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

    module.exports = {
      configureWebpack: (config) => {
        if (isProduction) {
          config.plugins.push(
            // ... PurgeCSSPlugin configuration ...
          );
        }
      },
    };
    ```

*   **Dynamic Class Names:** If you are using very dynamic class names (generated at runtime), PurgeCSS might not be able to detect them. Consider using a more predictable naming convention or explicitly adding those classes to the `safelist`.  Another solution is to add the dynamic classnames in the template.
*   **Watch for New BootstrapVue Versions:** BootstrapVue might introduce new CSS classes in future versions.  Be sure to update your `safelist` accordingly when upgrading BootstrapVue.
*   **Use Tailwind CSS Alternatives:** If you're starting a brand new project, consider using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS. These frameworks are designed to be PurgeCSS-friendly because you only include the utilities you actually use. This can lead to even smaller CSS bundles compared to BootstrapVue.

## Conclusion

Integrating PurgeCSS with BootstrapVue is a worthwhile effort to optimize your Vue.js application's performance. By removing unused CSS, you can significantly reduce your CSS bundle size, leading to faster page load times and a better user experience. Remember to test thoroughly and adjust your configuration as needed to ensure that all necessary styles are preserved. This guide provides a solid foundation for setting up PurgeCSS with BootstrapVue. Good luck and happy coding!
