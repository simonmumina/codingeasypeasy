# Comprehensive Guide to Error Tracking in Expo React Native Apps with Sentry

Building robust and reliable mobile applications requires effective error monitoring and tracking. Sentry is a powerful error tracking platform that integrates seamlessly with Expo React Native, allowing you to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues quickly and efficiently. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of integrating Sentry into your Expo project, covering everything from setup to advanced configuration.

## Why Use Sentry with Expo?

- **Real-time Error Monitoring:** Sentry provides immediate alerts when errors occur in your application, enabling you to respond promptly.
- **Detailed Error Context:** Sentry captures valuable context around errors, including device information, user data, and the stack trace, making debugging easier.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track performance bottlenecks and identify slow-loading components to optimize your application's speed.
- **User Feedback:** Integrate user feedback mechanisms to collect valuable insights directly from your app users.
- **Expo Integration:** Sentry provides dedicated SDKs and tools for seamless integration with Expo React Native projects.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed on your system.
- **Expo CLI:** Install the Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
- **Sentry Account:** Sign up for a free Sentry account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Step 1: Setting up your Expo Project

If you don't already have an Expo project, create one using the Expo CLI:

```plaintext
expo init my-expo-app
cd my-expo-app
```

Choose a template (e.g., `blank (TypeScript)`) or a managed workflow based on your needs.

## Step 2: Installing the Sentry SDK

Install the `@sentry/react-native` package and the necessary Expo integrations:

```plaintext
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
npx expo install react-native-config
npx expo install expo-constants
npx expo install expo-application

# or using yarn:
# yarn add @sentry/react-native
# yarn add react-native-config
# yarn add expo-constants
# yarn add expo-application
```

**Explanation:**

- `@sentry/react-native`: The official Sentry SDK for React Native applications.
- `react-native-config`: Used to manage environment variables, especially the Sentry DSN (Data Source Name).
- `expo-constants`: Provides access to Expo-specific constants like the Expo version and release channel.
- `expo-application`: Provides access to application ID.

## Step 3: Configuring Sentry

### 3.1 Obtaining your Sentry DSN

Log in to your Sentry account, create a new project, and select "React Native" as the platform. Sentry will provide you with a DSN, which is a unique identifier for your project. It will look similar to this:

```
https://YOUR_PUBLIC_DSN@sentry.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

### 3.2 Setting up Environment Variables

For security reasons, it's best practice to store your Sentry DSN in an environment variable. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (if you don't already have one) and add the following:

```
SENTRY_DSN=https://YOUR_PUBLIC_DSN@sentry.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

**Important:** Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your DSN to your repository.

### 3.3 Configuring `app.json` or `app.config.js`

Add the `react-native-dotenv` plugin to your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file. This allows the Sentry DSN to be injected into your application at build time. The precise configuration depends on whether you are using `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

**Using `app.json`:**

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "my-expo-app",
    // ... other configurations
    "plugins": [
      [
        "react-native-config",
        {
          "envFile": ".env",
          "allowlist": ["SENTRY_DSN"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

**Using `app.config.js` or `app.config.ts`:**

```plaintext
// app.config.js
import 'dotenv/config' // Import dotenv to load environment variables

export default ({ config }) => ({
  ...config,
  extra: {
    ...config.extra,
    sentryDsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN, // Make it available in your app
  },
  plugins: [
    [
      'react-native-config',
      {
        envFile: '.env',
        allowlist: ['SENTRY_DSN'],
      },
    ],
  ],
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `react-native-config`: This plugin allows you to access environment variables defined in your `.env` file within your React Native application.
- `envFile: ".env"`: Specifies the path to your environment file.
- `allowlist: ["SENTRY_DSN"]`: Specifies which environment variables should be exposed to your application. In this case, we are only exposing the `SENTRY_DSN`.
- The `app.config.js` example also loads the dotenv config directly, and sets the `sentryDsn` in the `extra` section of the Expo config. This is optional, but useful if you need to access the DSN in the app before Sentry is initialized (e.g., for displaying a config value).

### 3.4 Initializing Sentry in your Application

In your `App.js` or `App.tsx` (or the entry point of your application), initialize Sentry as early as possible.

```plaintext
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'
import { ExpoConstants } from 'expo-constants'
import { ExpoApplication } from 'expo-application'
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native'
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context'
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native'
import { Appearance } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === 'dark'

  React.useEffect(() => {
    Sentry.init({
      dsn: ExpoConstants?.manifest?.extra?.sentryDsn || process.env.SENTRY_DSN, // Access DSN from .env or app.config.js
      debug: __DEV__, // Enable debug mode in development
      environment: __DEV__ ? 'development' : 'production',
      release: `${ExpoApplication.applicationId}@${ExpoConstants?.expoConfig?.version}+${ExpoConstants?.expoConfig?.ios?.buildNumber || ExpoConstants?.expoConfig?.android?.versionCode}`, // Correctly formatted release string
      beforeSend(event, hint) {
        // Modify the event before sending it to Sentry
        if (event.exception && event.exception.values) {
          console.log('Sentry Event:', event)
        }
        return event
      },
    })
  }, [])

  const triggerError = () => {
    try {
      throw new Error('This is a test error from Sentry!')
    } catch (e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e)
    }
  }

  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets() // Access safe area insets
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: insets.top }}>
      <Text style={{ padding: 10 }}>App is running in {Appearance.getColorScheme()} mode</Text>
      <Text style={{ padding: 10 }}>Test out automatic and manual error handling</Text>
      <Button title="Trigger Error" onPress={triggerError} />
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`Sentry.init()`:** This function initializes the Sentry SDK.
- **`dsn`:** Your Sentry DSN. It's retrieved from the environment variable or from the `app.config.js`
- **`debug`:** Enables debug mode, which will print Sentry-related logs to the console. Only enable this in development.
- **`environment`:** Sets the environment in Sentry (e.g., "development", "production").
- **`release`:** Sets the release version of your application. This is crucial for associating errors with specific versions of your code. This is a combination of the application ID, the app version and the build number which is correctly formatted to work with Sentry.
- **`beforeSend`:** This optional function allows you to modify the error event before it's sent to Sentry. This can be useful for filtering out sensitive data or adding additional context. The example logs the `event` to the console so you can inspect the data being sent to Sentry.
- **`Sentry.captureException(e)`:** Manually capture and send exceptions to Sentry. This is shown inside of the `triggerError` function.
- **`Appearance.getColorScheme()`:** Detects the theme (light or dark mode) to demonstrate access to system settings.
- **`useSafeAreaInsets()`:** Used with the `react-native-safe-area-context` library to handle safe areas on different devices and OS versions.

**Important:** Make sure `App` is wrapped with the Sentry's ErrorBoundary. You'll need to install `@sentry/react` (not `@sentry/react-native`) for this. You can install it with `npm install @sentry/react`.

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
import {ErrorBoundary} from '@sentry/react';

function FallbackComponent({ error, resetError }: { error: Error; resetError: () => void }) {
  // Log the error to an error reporting service
  Sentry.captureException(error);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Something went wrong!</p>
      <pre style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetError}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<FallbackComponent />} onError={(error, componentStack) => {
      // Log the error to an error reporting service
      Sentry.captureException(error, { extra: { componentStack } });
      console.log(error.message)
    }}>
      <App />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Testing your Sentry Integration

Run your Expo application:

```plaintext
npx expo start
```

Click the "Trigger Error" button in your app. This will generate a JavaScript error, which Sentry should capture. Check your Sentry dashboard to confirm that the error is being reported.

## Step 5: Releasing the Correct Sourcemaps

For the stack traces to be properly symbolized in Sentry (showing the correct line numbers and file names), you need to upload sourcemaps to Sentry during the build process.

**Important**: Follow the Sentry Expo documentation here: [https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/expo/](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/expo/)

Here is a summary of the key steps, but **always refer to the latest Sentry documentation** for the most accurate instructions:

1.  **Install `@sentry/cli`:** `npm install -g @sentry/cli`
2.  **Configure the Sentry CLI:** `sentry-cli login` and `sentry-cli wizard` (choose "react-native")
3.  **Add a build script to your `package.json`**: This script will automate the sourcemap upload process. It typically involves building your Expo app (e.g., `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`) and then using the Sentry CLI to upload the sourcemaps.

Example build scripts in package.json:

```plaintext
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:ios": "eas build -p ios --profile production && sentry-cli react-native expo upload-sourcemaps --dist 1.0",
    "build:android": "eas build -p android --profile production && sentry-cli react-native expo upload-sourcemaps --dist 1.0"
  }
}
```

4.  **Create releases:** Create Sentry releases using the CLI command `sentry-cli releases new <release_name>` and finalize it using `sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>`.
5.  **Upload Sourcemaps:** Run the build script: `npm run build:ios` or `npm run build:android`.

## Step 6: Advanced Configuration and Usage

### 6.1. Setting User Context

You can provide Sentry with user context to identify which users are experiencing errors. This can be extremely helpful for debugging user-specific issues.

```plaintext
Sentry.setUser({
  id: '12345',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  username: 'johndoe',
})
```

### 6.2. Adding Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a trail of events leading up to an error. They can provide valuable insights into the user's actions before the error occurred.

```plaintext
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
  category: 'navigation',
  message: 'Navigated to profile screen',
  level: Sentry.Severity.Info,
})
```

### 6.3. Ignoring Errors

You may want to ignore certain errors that are not critical or that you are already aware of. You can use the `beforeSend` hook to filter out these errors.

```plaintext
Sentry.init({
  dsn: ExpoConstants?.manifest?.extra?.sentryDsn || process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  beforeSend(event, hint) {
    if (
      hint.originalException instanceof Error &&
      hint.originalException.message.includes('IgnoredError')
    ) {
      return null // Drop the event
    }
    return event
  },
})

// Example of throwing a handled error
try {
  // some code that can throw an error.
  throw new Error('IgnoredError')
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Caught and ignored error locally', error)
}
```

### 6.4. Performance Monitoring

Sentry offers performance monitoring features to track the performance of your application. You can use the `@sentry/react-native` package to measure transaction performance.

```plaintext
// Wrap your component with Sentry.wrap
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native'

function MyComponent() {
  // Your component logic
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default Sentry.wrap(MyComponent)
```

You can also manually create and manage transactions for more granular performance tracking.

```plaintext
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({ name: 'MyTransaction', op: 'component.mount' })

// Do some work
setTimeout(() => {
  transaction.finish()
}, 100)
```
