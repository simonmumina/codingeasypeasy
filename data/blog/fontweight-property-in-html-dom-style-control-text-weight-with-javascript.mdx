# fontWeight Property in HTML DOM Style: Control Text Weight with JavaScript

In web development, controlling the appearance of text is crucial for readability and visual appeal. The `fontWeight` property, accessible through the HTML DOM Style object in JavaScript, provides a powerful way to dynamically adjust the weight or thickness of text on your website. This blog post will dive deep into the `fontWeight` property, exploring its various values, demonstrating its usage with practical code examples, and offering tips for optimization.

## What is the `fontWeight` Property?

The `fontWeight` property is part of the CSS style properties that can be manipulated via JavaScript through the DOM (Document Object Model). It determines the thickness or boldness of the text rendered within an HTML element. Think of it as the programmatic equivalent of the CSS `font-weight` property. It allows you to:

- **Dynamically adjust text weight:** Change text to be bold, lighter, or even use numerical weights based on user interaction or data.
- **Create visual hierarchy:** Emphasize important sections of your content by highlighting them with different font weights.
- **Enhance user experience:** Offer options to users to customize the appearance of text, such as a 'high contrast' mode.

## Values of the `fontWeight` Property

The `fontWeight` property accepts several types of values, including:

- **Keywords:**

  - `normal`: Specifies a normal font weight. This is typically equivalent to 400. It's the default value.
  - `bold`: Specifies a bold font weight. This is typically equivalent to 700.
  - `bolder`: Specifies a weight that is bolder than the inherited weight.
  - `lighter`: Specifies a weight that is lighter than the inherited weight.

- **Numeric Values:**

  - Values ranging from `100` to `900`, in increments of 100. These values represent the thickness of the font on a scale where 400 is considered normal and 700 is considered bold. Common values include:
    - `100`: Thin
    - `200`: Extra Light (Ultra Light)
    - `300`: Light
    - `400`: Normal
    - `500`: Medium
    - `600`: Semi Bold (Demi Bold)
    - `700`: Bold
    - `800`: Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)
    - `900`: Black (Heavy)

- **Inherit:**
  - `inherit`: Specifies that the `fontWeight` property should inherit its value from its parent element.

**Important Note:** The actual visual difference between these values can vary depending on the font family being used. Some fonts may only support a limited range of weights.

## Using `fontWeight` in JavaScript: Code Examples

Let's look at some practical examples of how to use the `fontWeight` property in JavaScript:

**Example 1: Setting `fontWeight` to "bold"**

```javascript
// Get the element by its ID
const myHeading = document.getElementById('myHeading')

// Set the font weight to bold
myHeading.style.fontWeight = 'bold'
```

In this example, we first select an HTML element with the ID "myHeading" using `document.getElementById()`. Then, we access its `style` property and set its `fontWeight` to "bold".

**Example 2: Setting `fontWeight` to a numeric value (700)**

```javascript
// Get the element by its ID
const myParagraph = document.getElementById('myParagraph')

// Set the font weight to 700 (equivalent to bold)
myParagraph.style.fontWeight = '700'
```

This example demonstrates setting the `fontWeight` using a numeric value (700), which achieves the same result as using the "bold" keyword.

**Example 3: Dynamically Changing `fontWeight` on Button Click**

```plaintext
<button id="boldButton">Toggle Bold</button>
<p id="myText">This is some sample text.</p>

<script>
  const boldButton = document.getElementById("boldButton");
  const myText = document.getElementById("myText");

  boldButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
    if (myText.style.fontWeight === "bold") {
      myText.style.fontWeight = "normal";
    } else {
      myText.style.fontWeight = "bold";
    }
  });
</script>
```

This example showcases how to dynamically change the `fontWeight` on a button click. We add an event listener to the button that toggles the font weight between "normal" and "bold" each time it's clicked.

**Example 4: Using Numeric Values for Finer Control**

```plaintext
<input type="range" id="fontWeightSlider" min="100" max="900" step="100" value="400">
<p id="weightText">This text will change weight.</p>

<script>
  const fontWeightSlider = document.getElementById("fontWeightSlider");
  const weightText = document.getElementById("weightText");

  fontWeightSlider.addEventListener("input", () => {
    weightText.style.fontWeight = fontWeightSlider.value;
  });
</script>
```

Here, we use a range input to allow the user to select a specific numeric `fontWeight`. The `input` event listener updates the text's `fontWeight` dynamically based on the slider's value. This provides a more granular control over the text weight.

**Example 5: Inheriting `fontWeight` from the Parent Element**

```plaintext
<div style="font-weight: bold;">
  <p id="inheritedText" style="font-weight: inherit;">This text inherits the bold font weight from its parent.</p>
</div>
```

In this example, the paragraph with the ID "inheritedText" inherits the `fontWeight` from its parent `div` element due to the `font-weight: inherit;` style applied to it.

## Best Practices and Optimization Tips

- **Use Semantic HTML:** Employ semantic HTML elements like `<strong>` and `<em>` for emphasizing content where appropriate. These elements have default styles that include bold and italic, respectively, but can be further customized with CSS and JavaScript if needed. Avoid using JavaScript to apply styles that could be achieved more efficiently with CSS classes.

- **Consider Accessibility:** Ensure that changes in font weight don't negatively impact the accessibility of your website. Provide alternative ways to convey emphasis if necessary. Use sufficient contrast between text and background colors, especially for lighter font weights.

- **Performance:** Avoid excessive DOM manipulation, especially inside loops or frequently triggered event handlers. If you need to change the `fontWeight` of multiple elements, consider batching the updates or using CSS classes instead.

- **CSS Classes for Complex Styles:** For more complex styling scenarios, it's generally better to toggle CSS classes using JavaScript rather than directly manipulating inline styles. This promotes separation of concerns and makes your code more maintainable.

- **Font Loading:** If you are using custom fonts with varying weights, ensure that all the required font files are loaded correctly and efficiently. Use preloading and font display strategies to optimize loading times.

- **Testing:** Test your code across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent rendering of font weights. Different browsers and operating systems may handle font rendering slightly differently.

## SEO Considerations

While the `fontWeight` property itself doesn't directly impact SEO, the _way_ you use it can. Here's how:

- **Prioritize Readability:** Using `fontWeight` effectively enhances readability and user experience, which are crucial for SEO. Google values websites that provide a positive user experience.

- **Structure Content Logically:** Employ different font weights to create a clear visual hierarchy on your page. This makes it easier for users (and search engine crawlers) to understand the structure of your content. Use heavier weights for headings and subheadings to highlight important sections.

- **Avoid Keyword Stuffing:** Don't overuse bold text to simply stuff keywords into your content. This can be seen as a black-hat SEO tactic and may harm your rankings. Use font weight to naturally emphasize important words and phrases that are relevant to your topic.

## Conclusion

The `fontWeight` property in the HTML DOM Style object provides a powerful way to dynamically control the weight of text on your website using JavaScript. By understanding its various values and using it effectively, you can enhance the visual appeal, readability, and user experience of your website. Remember to follow best practices, consider accessibility, and be mindful of performance to ensure optimal results. This will not only improve the look and feel of your website but also contribute positively to your SEO efforts by creating a better experience for your users.
