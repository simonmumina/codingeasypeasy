# Comprehensive Guide to Monitoring Your Pyramid Application (Prometheus, New Relic)

Monitoring is crucial for ensuring the health, performance, and reliability of any web application, especially those built with frameworks like Pyramid. Proactive monitoring helps identify and address issues before they impact users, allowing for faster debugging and optimization. This comprehensive guide explores how to effectively monitor your Pyramid application using two powerful tools: Prometheus and New Relic.

## Why Monitoring Matters for Pyramid Applications

Pyramid, known for its flexibility and extensibility, empowers developers to build a wide range of applications, from simple APIs to complex web portals. However, this flexibility also means that the responsibility for monitoring falls squarely on the developer's shoulders. Without proper monitoring, you're essentially flying blind, unable to identify performance bottlenecks, error trends, or resource constraints.

Effective monitoring provides:

- **Early Problem Detection:** Identify issues before they impact users and lead to negative experiences.
- **Performance Optimization:** Pinpoint performance bottlenecks and optimize code for efficiency.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Quickly diagnose the root cause of errors and application problems.
- **Resource Management:** Track resource usage (CPU, memory, database connections) to optimize infrastructure.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Make informed decisions about application architecture and infrastructure based on real-world performance data.

## Monitoring Tools: Prometheus and New Relic

This guide focuses on two popular monitoring solutions:

- **Prometheus:** An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It excels at collecting and storing time-series data, making it ideal for monitoring application metrics. Prometheus typically requires a separate visualization tool like Grafana for creating dashboards.
- **New Relic:** A comprehensive observability platform that offers application performance monitoring (APM), infrastructure monitoring, log management, and more. New Relic provides a user-friendly interface and powerful features for analyzing application performance.

Both tools can be used effectively for monitoring Pyramid applications, and the choice depends on your specific requirements and preferences. Prometheus provides greater control and is often preferred by organizations that prioritize open-source solutions and have dedicated monitoring teams. New Relic offers a more streamlined experience and may be a better fit for teams seeking an all-in-one observability solution.

## Monitoring Pyramid with Prometheus

### 1. Installation and Setup

First, install Prometheus on your server or within your container environment. Follow the official Prometheus documentation for detailed installation instructions: [https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)

### 2. Instrumenting Your Pyramid Application

To expose metrics to Prometheus, you'll need to instrument your Pyramid application using a Python client library. The `prometheus_client` library is a popular choice.

```bash
pip install prometheus_client
```

### 3. Exposing Metrics

Create a view in your Pyramid application that exposes Prometheus metrics.

```plaintext
from pyramid.view import view_config
from prometheus_client import make_wsgi_app, Counter, Gauge, Histogram
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

# Define your metrics
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('my_app_requests_total', 'Total number of requests')
REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram('my_app_request_latency_seconds', 'Request latency in seconds')
GAUGE_EXAMPLE = Gauge('my_app_gauge_example', 'Example Gauge Metric')


@view_config(route_name='metrics')
def metrics_view(request):
    """Exposes Prometheus metrics."""
    app = make_wsgi_app()
    return app(request.environ, request.start_response)


@view_config(route_name='home', renderer='json')
def home_view(request):
    """Example view to demonstrate metrics."""
    with REQUEST_LATENCY.time():
        REQUEST_COUNT.inc() # Increment the counter on each request
        GAUGE_EXAMPLE.set(len(request.params))  # Example of setting a gauge value.
        # Your application logic here...
        return {'message': 'Hello, Pyramid!'}

def includeme(config):
    config.add_route('metrics', '/metrics')
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.scan()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    from pyramid.config import Configurator
    with Configurator() as config:
        config.include(includeme)
        app = config.make_wsgi_app()
    server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 6543, app)
    print("Serving on port 6543...")
    server.serve_forever()
```

**Explanation:**

- **`prometheus_client`:** Imports the necessary Prometheus client library components.
- **Metric Definitions:** Defines the metrics you want to track:
  - `Counter`: A metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter. Useful for tracking request counts, error rates, etc.
  - `Histogram`: A metric that samples observations (like request latencies) and counts them in configurable buckets. Useful for understanding the distribution of values.
  - `Gauge`: A metric that represents a single numerical value that can go up or down. Useful for tracking memory usage, queue lengths, etc.
- **`metrics_view`:** This Pyramid view is configured to respond to requests on the `/metrics` route. It uses `make_wsgi_app` to create a WSGI application that serves the Prometheus metrics in the required format.
- **`home_view`:** An example view that demonstrates how to use the metrics. The `REQUEST_COUNT.inc()` increments the counter on each request. `REQUEST_LATENCY.time()` is used as a context manager, automatically measuring the time taken for the code block to execute and adding the value to the histogram. `GAUGE_EXAMPLE.set(len(request.params))` sets the gauge to the number of request parameters.
- **`includeme`:** This function configures the routes for the application. It adds the `/metrics` route, the `/` route, and scans the current module for view configurations.
- **Main Block:** Creates a Pyramid application and starts a WSGI server to serve the application.

### 4. Configuring Prometheus

Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your Pyramid application. Add the following to your `prometheus.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'pyramid_app'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:6543'] # Replace with your Pyramid app's address and port
```

**Explanation:**

- **`scrape_configs`:** Defines how Prometheus discovers and collects metrics from your application.
- **`job_name`:** A name for this scrape configuration (e.g., "pyramid_app").
- **`scrape_interval`:** How often Prometheus should scrape the metrics endpoint (e.g., every 5 seconds).
- **`static_configs`:** Defines the target(s) to scrape. In this example, it's scraping `localhost:6543` where your Pyramid application is running. You'll need to adjust this to match your actual deployment configuration.

Restart Prometheus to apply the changes.

### 5. Visualizing Metrics with Grafana (Optional)

While Prometheus stores the metrics, it doesn't provide built-in visualization. Grafana is a popular open-source data visualization tool that integrates seamlessly with Prometheus.

1.  **Install Grafana:** Follow the Grafana installation instructions for your platform: [https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/)
2.  **Add Prometheus as a Data Source:** In Grafana, add Prometheus as a data source, configuring the URL of your Prometheus server.
3.  **Create Dashboards:** Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize your Pyramid application metrics. Use PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to query and display the data.

**Example Grafana Dashboard (PromQL Queries):**

- **Total Request Count:** `sum(my_app_requests_total)`
- **Average Request Latency:** `avg(rate(my_app_request_latency_seconds_sum[5m]))`
- **Request Latency (95th Percentile):** `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(my_app_request_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))`

## Monitoring Pyramid with New Relic

### 1. Sign Up for New Relic

If you don't already have one, create a New Relic account: [https://newrelic.com/](https://newrelic.com/)

### 2. Install the New Relic Python Agent

Install the New Relic Python agent using pip:

```bash
pip install newrelic
```

### 3. Configure the New Relic Agent

Create a `newrelic.ini` file in the root directory of your Pyramid application and configure it with your New Relic license key. You can find your license key in your New Relic account.

```ini
[newrelic]
app_name = MyPyramidApp
license_key = YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` with your actual New Relic license key. You can also configure other settings in the `newrelic.ini` file, such as logging levels and transaction naming rules.

### 4. Integrate New Relic with Your Pyramid Application

There are several ways to integrate the New Relic agent with your Pyramid application:

**a) Using the `newrelic-admin` script (Recommended for WSGI servers):**

Wrap your WSGI application using the `newrelic-admin` script. For example, if you're using Gunicorn:

```bash
newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myapp:main
```

**b) Programmatic Instrumentation (Less common, but flexible):**

You can manually instrument your application code using the `newrelic.agent` module.

```plaintext
import newrelic.agent
from pyramid.config import Configurator
from pyramid.view import view_config

newrelic.agent.initialize('newrelic.ini')

@view_config(route_name='home', renderer='json')
@newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() # wrap the entire view
def home_view(request):
    # Your application logic here...
    return {'message': 'Hello, Pyramid!'}

def includeme(config):
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.scan()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Configurator() as config:
        config.include(includeme)
        app = config.make_wsgi_app()
        app = newrelic.agent.wsgi_application()(app) # Wrap entire application if needed
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 6543, app)
    print("Serving on port 6543...")
    server.serve_forever()
```

**Explanation:**

- **`newrelic.agent.initialize('newrelic.ini')`:** Initializes the New Relic agent using the configuration file. This should be called before any other New Relic agent calls.
- **`@newrelic.agent.wsgi_application()`:** This decorator wraps the WSGI application or specific views, allowing New Relic to monitor their performance. It can be applied to individual view functions or the entire application. Wrapping the view is generally preferred for simpler applications.

### 5. Deploy and Monitor

Deploy your Pyramid application with the New Relic agent enabled. Once your application is running, you can log in to your New Relic account and start monitoring its performance.

New Relic provides a wealth of information, including:

- **Transaction Traces:** Detailed traces of individual requests, showing the time spent in each part of your application.
- **Error Rates:** Track the frequency and types of errors occurring in your application.
- **Database Performance:** Monitor the performance of your database queries.
- **Infrastructure Metrics:** Track CPU usage, memory usage, and other infrastructure metrics.

## Custom Instrumentation with New Relic

You can also use the New Relic agent to instrument specific parts of your code and track custom metrics.

```plaintext
import newrelic.agent

@view_config(route_name='process_data', renderer='json')
def process_data_view(request):
    with newrelic.agent.TracedMethod('process_data'): # Trace specific function
        # Simulate a long-running process
        time.sleep(2)
        return {'message': 'Data processed'}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`newrelic.agent.TracedMethod('process_data')`:** This context manager traces the execution of the code within the `with` block. It allows you to monitor the performance of specific functions or code sections. The name `process_data` will appear in New Relic as the transaction name.

You can also use `newrelic.agent.record_custom_metric()` to record custom metrics related to your application.
