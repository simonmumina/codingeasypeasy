# Fullscreen API: Detect Fullscreen Support with `fullscreenEnabled()` - A Comprehensive Guide

The Fullscreen API empowers web developers to bring a more immersive experience to users by allowing elements to be displayed in fullscreen mode. Knowing whether or not the user's browser actually _supports_ fullscreen mode is crucial before attempting to use the API. This is where `fullscreenEnabled()` comes in handy. This guide will dive deep into `fullscreenEnabled()`, explaining how to use it, why it's important, and highlighting potential cross-browser considerations.

## What is the Fullscreen API?

The Fullscreen API is a web API that allows websites to request that an element, such as a video or a game canvas, be displayed in fullscreen mode. This removes the browser's user interface elements (address bar, toolbars, etc.) to provide a completely immersive experience for the user.

## Why Detect Fullscreen Support?

Before attempting to use the Fullscreen API, it's vital to determine whether the user's browser supports it. There are several reasons for this:

- **Browser Compatibility:** Not all browsers implement the Fullscreen API, or they might implement slightly different versions.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** If you attempt to request fullscreen mode on a browser that doesn't support it, it will simply fail. By detecting support beforehand, you can provide fallback solutions or gracefully hide fullscreen buttons, avoiding confusion and improving the user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Understanding fullscreen support allows you to tailor the experience for users with assistive technologies or those who prefer not to use fullscreen mode.

## The `fullscreenEnabled()` Method

The `fullscreenEnabled()` method is a boolean property (sometimes accessed as a function depending on the browser prefix) that resides on the `document` object. It returns `true` if the user agent allows the element to be placed in fullscreen mode and `false` otherwise. This check considers browser settings, security restrictions, and user preferences.

**Note:** Older browsers used vendor prefixes for this API. Therefore, your code needs to account for these prefixes to ensure wider compatibility.

## Using `fullscreenEnabled()`: Code Examples

Here's how to use `fullscreenEnabled()` to detect fullscreen support:

**Basic Example:**

```plaintext
function isFullscreenEnabled() {
  return (
    document.fullscreenEnabled ||
    document.webkitFullscreenEnabled ||
    document.mozFullScreenEnabled ||
    document.msFullscreenEnabled ||
    false
  );
}

if (isFullscreenEnabled()) {
  console.log("Fullscreen API is supported!");
  // Enable your fullscreen button or logic here
} else {
  console.log("Fullscreen API is not supported in this browser.");
  // Hide or disable your fullscreen button
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`isFullscreenEnabled()` Function:** This function centralizes the fullscreen capability check, handling different browser prefixes.
2. **Prefix Check:** The function checks for the standard `document.fullscreenEnabled` property, as well as the vendor-prefixed versions (`webkitFullscreenEnabled`, `mozFullScreenEnabled`, `msFullscreenEnabled`). This ensures compatibility with older browsers.
3. **Boolean Return:** It returns `true` if any of the properties exist and are truthy (meaning fullscreen is enabled), and `false` otherwise.
4. **Conditional Logic:** The `if/else` statement demonstrates how to use the function to determine whether to enable or disable fullscreen-related functionality in your application.

**Integrating with a Button Click:**

```plaintext
const fullscreenButton = document.getElementById("fullscreen-button");

function requestFullscreen(element) {
  if (element.requestFullscreen) {
    element.requestFullscreen();
  } else if (element.webkitRequestFullscreen) {
    element.webkitRequestFullscreen();
  } else if (element.mozRequestFullScreen) {
    element.mozRequestFullScreen();
  } else if (element.msRequestFullscreen) {
    element.msRequestFullscreen();
  }
}

if (isFullscreenEnabled()) {
  fullscreenButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
    const element = document.documentElement; // Or any specific element
    requestFullscreen(element);
  });
} else {
  fullscreenButton.style.display = "none"; // Hide the button if fullscreen is not supported
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Button Element:** `document.getElementById("fullscreen-button")` gets the element with the ID "fullscreen-button". Make sure you have this button defined in your HTML.
2. **`requestFullscreen()` Function:** This function handles requesting fullscreen mode, again accounting for browser prefixes. It accepts the element you want to put in fullscreen as an argument.
3. **Event Listener:** If `isFullscreenEnabled()` returns `true`, an event listener is attached to the button. When the button is clicked, the `requestFullscreen()` function is called, attempting to put the `document.documentElement` (the entire HTML document) into fullscreen mode. You can change this to a specific element you want to make fullscreen.
4. **Hiding the Button:** If `isFullscreenEnabled()` returns `false`, the button's `display` style is set to "none", effectively hiding it from the user.

**React Example:**

```plaintext
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

const FullscreenComponent = () => {
  const [isFullscreenSupported, setIsFullscreenSupported] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkFullscreenSupport = () => {
      setIsFullscreenSupported(
        document.fullscreenEnabled ||
          document.webkitFullscreenEnabled ||
          document.mozFullScreenEnabled ||
          document.msFullscreenEnabled ||
          false
      )
    }

    checkFullscreenSupport() // Initial check

    // Optionally, you can add a listener for fullscreenchange events for more dynamic updates
    // document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', checkFullscreenSupport);
    // return () => {
    //   document.removeEventListener('fullscreenchange', checkFullscreenSupport);
    // };
  }, []) // Run only on mount

  const toggleFullscreen = () => {
    const element = document.documentElement

    if (
      !document.fullscreenElement &&
      !document.mozFullScreenElement &&
      !document.webkitFullscreenElement &&
      !document.msFullscreenElement
    ) {
      // current working methods
      if (element.requestFullscreen) {
        element.requestFullscreen()
      } else if (element.mozRequestFullScreen) {
        element.mozRequestFullScreen()
      } else if (element.webkitRequestFullscreen) {
        element.webkitRequestFullscreen(Element.ALLOW_KEYBOARD_INPUT)
      } else if (element.msRequestFullscreen) {
        element.msRequestFullscreen()
      }
    } else {
      if (document.exitFullscreen) {
        document.exitFullscreen()
      } else if (document.mozCancelFullScreen) {
        document.mozCancelFullScreen()
      } else if (document.webkitExitFullscreen) {
        document.webkitExitFullscreen()
      } else if (document.msExitFullscreen) {
        document.msExitFullscreen()
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {isFullscreenSupported ? (
        <button onClick={toggleFullscreen}>
          {document.fullscreenElement ? 'Exit Fullscreen' : 'Enter Fullscreen'}
        </button>
      ) : (
        <p>Fullscreen not supported in this browser.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default FullscreenComponent
```

**Explanation:**

1. **State Management:** `useState` is used to manage the `isFullscreenSupported` state, initially set to `false`.
2. **`useEffect` Hook:** The `useEffect` hook runs only once on component mount (due to the empty dependency array `[]`). It calls `checkFullscreenSupport` to determine if fullscreen is supported.
3. **`checkFullscreenSupport` Function:** This function, similar to the previous examples, checks for fullscreen support using browser prefixes and updates the `isFullscreenSupported` state accordingly.
4. **Conditional Rendering:** The component conditionally renders a button only if `isFullscreenSupported` is `true`. Otherwise, it displays a message indicating that fullscreen is not supported.
5. **`toggleFullscreen` Function:** This function handles toggling fullscreen on and off. It checks if any element is currently in fullscreen and either requests fullscreen or exits fullscreen accordingly.

## Cross-Browser Considerations and Vendor Prefixes

As mentioned previously, older browsers required vendor prefixes for the Fullscreen API. Here's a summary of common prefixes:

- **`-webkit-`:** Used by Chrome, Safari, and newer versions of Opera.
- **`-moz-`:** Used by Firefox.
- **`-ms-`:** Used by Internet Explorer and Edge (legacy).

Always check for these prefixes to ensure wider compatibility. The code examples provided handle these prefixes.

## Best Practices

- **Feature Detection:** Always use `fullscreenEnabled()` to detect support before attempting to use the Fullscreen API.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Provide alternative experiences for users whose browsers don't support fullscreen.
- **User Permissions:** The user may need to grant permission for the website to enter fullscreen mode.
- **Fullscreen Events:** Listen for `fullscreenchange` events to react to changes in fullscreen state (e.g., when the user exits fullscreen).
- **Keyboard Input:** When requesting fullscreen, you may need to specifically allow keyboard input for elements like `<input>` fields by passing `Element.ALLOW_KEYBOARD_INPUT` to `webkitRequestFullscreen`.
- **Accessibility:** Consider the needs of users with disabilities when designing your fullscreen experience. Provide clear instructions on how to enter and exit fullscreen.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your fullscreen implementation across different browsers and devices.

## Conclusion

The Fullscreen API provides a powerful way to enhance the user experience on the web. By using `fullscreenEnabled()` to detect support and implementing fallback solutions, you can ensure that your application works seamlessly across different browsers and devices. Remember to account for vendor prefixes and consider accessibility when designing your fullscreen experience. By following these best practices, you can create immersive and engaging web experiences for your users.
