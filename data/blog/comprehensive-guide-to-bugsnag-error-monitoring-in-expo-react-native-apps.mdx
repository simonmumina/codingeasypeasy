# Comprehensive Guide to BugSnag Error Monitoring in Expo React Native Apps

Building robust and reliable mobile applications with Expo and React Native requires more than just writing great code. You need a system in place to identify, diagnose, and resolve errors quickly and efficiently.  This is where BugSnag comes in. BugSnag is a powerful error monitoring and crash reporting platform that provides detailed insights into your application's stability.

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating BugSnag into your Expo React Native project, covering everything from setup and configuration to advanced features. We'll explore how to capture errors, track performance metrics, and leverage BugSnag's capabilities to build more stable and user-friendly apps.

## Why Use BugSnag with Expo?

Expo simplifies React Native development, but it also abstracts away some of the underlying native platform details.  This abstraction can make debugging challenging. BugSnag fills this gap by providing:

*   **Automatic Crash Reporting:** Captures unhandled exceptions and crashes, providing detailed stack traces, device information, and user context.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Tracks user actions leading up to an error, providing valuable context for debugging.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Measures app load times, network requests, and other key performance indicators to identify bottlenecks.
*   **User Tracking:**  Identifies affected users and allows you to prioritize fixes based on impact.
*   **Easy Integration:** BugSnag offers a dedicated Expo SDK that simplifies setup and configuration.

## Getting Started: Installation and Configuration

1.  **Install the BugSnag Expo Package:**

    First, install the `bugsnag-react-native` package using `expo install`:

    ```bash
    npx expo install @bugsnag/react-native
    ```

2.  **Obtain Your BugSnag API Key:**

    If you don't already have a BugSnag account, create one at [https://www.bugsnag.com/](https://www.bugsnag.com/). Once you're logged in, create a new project and retrieve your API key. This key is essential for connecting your app to BugSnag.

3.  **Configure BugSnag in `App.js` (or your entry point):**

    Import the `bugsnag-react-native` package and initialize BugSnag at the top of your `App.js` (or the main entry point of your application).

    ```javascript
    import Bugsnag from '@bugsnag/react-native';
    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

    Bugsnag.start({
      apiKey: 'YOUR_BUGSNAG_API_KEY', // Replace with your actual API key
      appVersion: '1.0.0', // Consider pulling this from your package.json
      releaseStage: __DEV__ ? 'development' : 'production', // Distinguish environments
      enabledBreadcrumbTypes: ['navigation', 'state', 'log', 'user', 'request', 'process'],
      autoTrackSessions: true, // recommended for usage insights
    });

    export default function App() {

      useEffect(() => {
        // Example: Notify Bugsnag of a handled error
        try {
          // Some potentially failing code here
          // throw new Error("This is a test handled error!");
        } catch (error) {
          Bugsnag.notify(error, (event) => {
              event.severity = "info"; // You can control the severity
              event.addMetadata("debug", { message: "This is additional context." });
          });
        }
      }, []);

      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
          <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }

    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   `apiKey`:  Replace `'YOUR_BUGSNAG_API_KEY'` with your actual BugSnag API key.
    *   `appVersion`:  Sets the version of your application. This helps you track errors in specific releases.  Consider reading this value from your `package.json`.
    *   `releaseStage`:  Defines the environment (e.g., `'development'`, `'production'`, `'staging'`).  Using `__DEV__` automatically distinguishes development and production builds.
    *   `enabledBreadcrumbTypes`: Configures which breadcrumb types will be automatically captured.
    *   `autoTrackSessions`: Enables automatic tracking of user sessions. This is highly recommended.

## Testing Your Integration

To ensure BugSnag is correctly integrated, trigger a test error.  You can do this by deliberately introducing an error in your code or by using BugSnag's utility methods.

**1. Unhandled Error (Recommended for initial testing):**

   Simply cause an unhandled JavaScript exception. The BugSnag SDK should automatically catch and report it.  Remove the comments from the line causing the error within the useEffect hook in the `App.js` file above:

   ```javascript
   throw new Error("This is a test unhandled error!");
   ```

   **Important:** Remove or comment out this test code after verifying your BugSnag integration.

**2. Handled Error with `Bugsnag.notify`:**

   Use the `Bugsnag.notify` method to report handled exceptions or other important events. This gives you more control over the severity and metadata associated with the error.  The example in the `App.js` code demonstrates this:

   ```javascript
       try {
          // Some potentially failing code here
          // throw new Error("This is a test handled error!");
        } catch (error) {
          Bugsnag.notify(error, (event) => {
              event.severity = "info"; // You can control the severity
              event.addMetadata("debug", { message: "This is additional context." });
          });
        }
   ```

After triggering the error, check your BugSnag dashboard to confirm that the error report is received.  It might take a few minutes for the report to appear.

## Advanced Configuration and Features

BugSnag offers a wide range of configuration options and features to customize your error monitoring.

**1. User Tracking:**

   Identify users who are experiencing errors.  This allows you to prioritize fixes based on user impact.

   ```javascript
   Bugsnag.setUser('user-id-123', 'example@email.com', 'John Doe');

   // Clear user information
   Bugsnag.clearUser();
   ```

**2. Breadcrumbs:**

   Breadcrumbs provide a timeline of user actions leading up to an error.  They can be automatically captured (navigation, state changes, logs) or manually added.

   ```javascript
   Bugsnag.leaveBreadcrumb('User tapped the button', {
       category: 'ui',
       type: 'userAction'
   });
   ```

**3. Metadata:**

   Attach custom metadata to error reports to provide additional context.

   ```javascript
   Bugsnag.notify(error, (event) => {
       event.addMetadata('user', {
           id: 'user-id-123',
           email: 'example@email.com'
       });
       event.addMetadata('request', {
           url: '/api/users',
           method: 'GET'
       });
   });
   ```

**4. Sessions:**

   BugSnag tracks sessions to provide insights into app stability and usage. Automatic session tracking is enabled by setting `autoTrackSessions: true` in your Bugsnag configuration.

   ```javascript
    // To manually start and end a session, use the following:
    // Bugsnag.startSession(); // if autoTrackSessions is false
    // Bugsnag.pauseSession();
    // Bugsnag.resumeSession();
    // Bugsnag.endSession();
   ```

**5. Ignored Errors:**

   You can configure BugSnag to ignore specific errors or error patterns.

   ```javascript
   Bugsnag.start({
       apiKey: 'YOUR_BUGSNAG_API_KEY',
       ignore: [
           /^Network request failed/ // Ignore network errors
       ]
   });
   ```

**6. Controlling Severity:**

   You can control the severity level of errors that are reported to BugSnag.  The severity can be `error`, `warning`, or `info`.

   ```javascript
   Bugsnag.notify(error, (event) => {
       event.severity = 'warning'; // Set the severity to warning
   });
   ```

**7.  Release Health:**

Bugsnag's Release Health feature allows you to monitor the stability of your application releases over time.  It provides insights into crash rates, error rates, and other key metrics. This feature typically requires more advanced setup, including configuring your build process to report release information to BugSnag.  Refer to the BugSnag documentation for specific instructions.

## Example: Monitoring API Request Errors

Let's illustrate how to use BugSnag to monitor API request errors, a common scenario in React Native development.

```javascript
import Bugsnag from '@bugsnag/react-native';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); // Replace with your API endpoint
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`API request failed with status ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    Bugsnag.notify(error, (event) => {
      event.addMetadata('api', {
        url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
        method: 'GET',
      });
      event.severity = 'warning'; // or 'error' depending on the severity
    });
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    return null; // Or handle the error as needed
  }
};

export default function App() {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      const getData = async () => {
        const fetchedData = await fetchData();
        setData(fetchedData);
      };
      getData();
    }, []);

    return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
            <Text>Data: {data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</Text>
        </View>
    );
}
```

In this example:

*   We wrap the `fetch` call in a `try...catch` block.
*   If the API request fails (e.g., network error, server error), we catch the error and use `Bugsnag.notify` to report it.
*   We add metadata about the API request (URL, method) to provide context.
*   We set the severity level to `warning` or `error` depending on the nature of the failure.
*   The error is also logged to the console for local debugging.

## Best Practices for Using BugSnag

*   **Configure BugSnag Early:** Initialize BugSnag as early as possible in your application's lifecycle to ensure that all errors are captured.
*   **Set the `releaseStage` Correctly:**  Use different `releaseStage` values for development, staging, and production environments to filter and prioritize errors effectively.
*   **Use Meaningful Metadata:**  Attach relevant metadata to error reports to provide context and facilitate debugging.
*   **Track User Actions with Breadcrumbs:** Use breadcrumbs to capture the sequence of events leading up to an error.
*   **Monitor Your BugSnag Dashboard Regularly:**  Review your BugSnag dashboard frequently to identify and address critical errors.
*   **Use Source Maps:**  Upload source maps to BugSnag to de-obfuscate stack traces and make them easier to understand.  This is particularly important for production builds.  See the BugSnag documentation for instructions on how to do this with Expo.
*   **Configure Ignoring Rules Carefully:**  Be cautious when ignoring errors, as you may miss important issues.  Make sure you understand the potential consequences of ignoring specific errors.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Errors Not Appearing in BugSnag:**
    *   Double-check your API key in `Bugsnag.start()`.
    *   Verify that your application is connected to the internet.
    *   Ensure that the `releaseStage` is correctly configured.
    *   Check your BugSnag dashboard for any filtering rules that might be hiding the errors.

*   **Stack Traces Are Obfuscated:**
    *   Upload source maps to BugSnag to de-obfuscate stack traces. This is essential for production builds.

*   **Performance Issues After Integration:**
    *   BugSnag's SDK is designed to be lightweight, but excessive logging or metadata collection can impact performance.  Optimize your use of `Bugsnag.notify` and `Bugsnag.leaveBreadcrumb`.
