# JavaScript RegExp Advanced Examples: Mastering Regular Expressions for Complex Patterns

Regular expressions (RegExp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation in JavaScript. While basic RegExp syntax is relatively straightforward, mastering advanced techniques unlocks a whole new level of possibilities. This blog post will explore advanced JavaScript RegExp examples, equipping you with the knowledge to tackle complex pattern matching challenges.

## Why Advanced RegExp?

Simple regular expressions can handle basic search and replace tasks. However, when dealing with complex data validation, text parsing, or sophisticated data extraction, advanced features become indispensable. They allow you to:

- **Match patterns based on context:** Lookarounds enable matching based on surrounding text without including it in the captured group.
- **Reuse captured groups:** Backreferences allow you to refer to previously matched groups within the same regular expression.
- **Create dynamic and flexible patterns:** Conditional matching lets you define alternative patterns based on whether a previous group has matched.
- **Optimize performance:** Understanding how the RegExp engine works allows you to write more efficient expressions.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the advanced examples, it's assumed you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and regular expression syntax, including:

- Character classes (`\w`, `\d`, `\s`)
- Quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}`)
- Anchors (`^`, `$`, `\b`)
- Grouping and capturing (`()`)
- Basic RegExp methods (`test()`, `exec()`, `match()`, `replace()`, `search()`)

If you need a refresher, numerous online resources are available, including the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs.

## 1. Lookarounds: Matching Context Without Capturing

Lookarounds are zero-width assertions that match a position in the string based on whether a pattern precedes or follows it. They don't consume any characters in the string, meaning they are not included in the final match. There are two main types of lookarounds:

- **Positive Lookahead `(?=pattern)`:** Matches if the pattern _follows_ the current position.
- **Negative Lookahead `(?!pattern)`:** Matches if the pattern does _not_ follow the current position.
- **Positive Lookbehind `(?<=pattern)`:** Matches if the pattern _precedes_ the current position.
- **Negative Lookbehind `(?<!pattern)`:** Matches if the pattern does _not_ precede the current position.

**Example 1: Matching only the price of USD values**

```plaintext
const text = "The price is $100, and in EUR it's €80. The USD price is $120.";
const regex = /(?<=\$)\d+/g; // Positive lookbehind for '$' followed by one or more digits
const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["100", "120"]
```

This example uses a positive lookbehind `(?<=\$)` to match only the digits that are preceded by a dollar sign. The dollar sign itself is _not_ included in the match.

**Example 2: Matching words that are not followed by a period.**

```plaintext
const text = "This is a sentence. This is another.";
const regex = /\b\w+\b(?!\.)/g; // Matches a word that is not followed by a period
const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["This", "is", "a", "This", "is", "another"]
```

This uses a negative lookahead `(?!\.)` to exclude words that end with a period.

**Example 3: Checking for strong passwords (minimum 8 characters, one uppercase, one lowercase, and one number)**

```plaintext
function isStrongPassword(password) {
  const regex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}$/;
  return regex.test(password);
}

console.log(isStrongPassword("Password123"));   // true
console.log(isStrongPassword("password123"));   // false
console.log(isStrongPassword("PASSword12"));   // false
console.log(isStrongPassword("Pass1"));         // false
console.log(isStrongPassword("PAssword1"));    // true
```

This cleverly uses multiple positive lookaheads to ensure all the password criteria are met _before_ matching any characters. The `.{8,}` part then requires at least 8 characters of any kind to be present. This avoids having to specify the order in which these characters must appear.

## 2. Backreferences: Referencing Previously Captured Groups

Backreferences allow you to refer to a previously captured group within the same regular expression. They are denoted by `\1`, `\2`, `\3`, etc., where the number corresponds to the order of the capturing group (from left to right).

**Example 1: Finding duplicate words in a string.**

```plaintext
const text = "This is is a test test string string.";
const regex = /\b(\w+)\s+\1\b/g; // Matches a word followed by itself
const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["is is", "test test", "string string"]
```

In this example, `(\w+)` captures a word. `\1` then refers to the same word that was captured in the first group. This regex effectively finds consecutive duplicate words.

**Example 2: Swapping the first and last word in a string (using `replace`)**

```plaintext
const text = "The quick brown fox";
const regex = /^(\w+)(.*)(\w+)$/;
const newText = text.replace(regex, "$3$2$1");

console.log(newText); // Output: fox quick brown The
```

Here, we capture the first word in group 1, the middle part in group 2, and the last word in group 3. The `replace` method uses `$1`, `$2`, and `$3` to refer to these groups and reorders them. This is different from `\1` which is used within the _regex pattern_ itself. `$1`, `$2`, etc. are used within the _replacement string_ in `replace()`.

**Example 3: Validating HTML tag pairs**

```plaintext
const html = "<div>This is some text</div> <p>Another paragraph</p> <span></span>";
const regex = /<(\w+)>.*<\/\1>/g; // Matches opening and closing tags
const matches = html.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["<div>This is some text</div>", "<span></span>"]
```

This regular expression captures the tag name in the first group `(\w+)` and then uses `\1` to ensure that the closing tag matches the opening tag. Note this doesn't validate nested tags properly, but illustrates the backreference concept.

## 3. Conditional Matching (Not Widely Supported)

While not fully supported by all JavaScript RegExp engines, conditional matching provides a way to define alternative patterns based on whether a previous capturing group has matched. The syntax typically involves `(?(condition)then|else)`.

**Important Note:** JavaScript's native RegExp implementation has limited support for conditional matching. While some JavaScript engines (like those in Node.js with specific flags or browser extensions) might support it, relying on it for general web development is _not recommended_ due to inconsistent browser support. It's more common to achieve the same results using alternative techniques.

**Conceptual Example (This might not work in all JavaScript environments)**

Let's imagine we want to match phone numbers that either start with '+1' or without it, but if they start with '+1', they must have a space after it.

```plaintext
// This example is conceptual and may not function as expected in all JS environments.
const text = "+1 555-123-4567 555-123-4567 +1555-123-4567";
// Intended regex (may not work in all JS environments)
// const regex = /(\+1)?(?(1)\s)\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/g;

//Alternative using OR:
const regex = /(\+1\s\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})|(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})/g

const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Intended Output: ["+1 555-123-4567", "555-123-4567"]
```

In this (theoretical) example, `(\+1)?` captures the '+1' if it exists. `(?(1)\s)` then means: "if group 1 matched, require a space". The `\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}` part then matches the phone number format. Because conditional matching is not well supported, the best practice to solve the phone number is to use the alternative as below, which concatenates the regular expressions with "OR"

**Alternative (Recommended Approach):**

Since conditional matching is problematic, you can often achieve the same results with alternatives using the `|` (OR) operator:

```plaintext
const text = "+1 555-123-4567 555-123-4567 +1555-123-4567";
const regex = /(\+1\s\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})|(\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4})/g;
const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["+1 555-123-4567", "555-123-4567"]
```

This provides a reliable and widely supported way to handle conditional-like matching in JavaScript.

## 4. Flags: Modifying RegExp Behavior

Regular expression flags modify how the expression is interpreted. Some commonly used flags include:

- `g` (global): Finds all matches instead of stopping after the first.
- `i` (ignore case): Performs case-insensitive matching.
- `m` (multiline): Treats `^` and `$` as matching the start and end of each line (delimited by `\n` or `\r`) rather than the start and end of the entire string.
- `s` (dotall): Allows the `.` to match newline characters as well. (Not supported in all older browsers)
- `u` (unicode): Enables full Unicode support, including proper handling of surrogate pairs and Unicode properties.
- `y` (sticky): Matches from the lastIndex position of the string.

**Example 1: Case-insensitive search for multiple occurrences**

```plaintext
const text = "The quick BROWN fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
const regex = /the/gi; // g: global, i: ignore case
const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["The", "the"]
```

**Example 2: Matching across multiple lines**

```plaintext
const text = `First line.
Second line.
Third line.`;

const regex = /^Second line.$/m; // m: multiline
const match = text.match(regex);

console.log(match); // Output: ["Second line."]
```

Without the `m` flag, `^` and `$` would only match the very beginning and very end of the _entire_ string, and the regex wouldn't find a match.

**Example 3: Using the sticky flag**

```plaintext
const text = "hello world hello";
const regex = /hello/y;  // y: sticky

regex.lastIndex = 6; // start search at index 6

const match = regex.exec(text);

console.log(match); // null, because at index 6, the pattern is not matched.

regex.lastIndex = 0; // reset to 0
const match2 = regex.exec(text);

console.log(match2); // ["hello", index: 0, input: "hello world hello", groups: undefined]

const match3 = regex.exec(text); // since lastIndex is not reset, lastIndex remain 5
console.log(match3) // null
```

The sticky flag requires the match to start exactly at the `lastIndex` of the RegExp object. If it doesn't, the match fails. It's useful for parsing sequential data. `regex.exec()` needs to be used with `y` to ensure `lastIndex` is updated. `string.match()` doesn't respect or update `lastIndex`.

## 5. Character Classes and Unicode

JavaScript supports Unicode character classes, which allow you to match characters based on their properties (e.g., script, category). The `\p{...}` and `\P{...}` character classes (for positive and negative matching respectively) require the `u` (unicode) flag.

**Example: Matching only Cyrillic characters**

```plaintext
const text = "Привет мир! Hello world!";
const regex = /\p{Script=Cyrillic}+/gu; // g: global, u: unicode
const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["Привет", "мир"]
```

This example uses `\p{Script=Cyrillic}` to match one or more consecutive Cyrillic characters.

**Example: Matching any emoji**

```plaintext
const text = "This string contains 😁 emojis 🤔 and some text.";
const regex = /\p{Emoji}+/gu;
const matches = text.match(regex);

console.log(matches); // Output: ["😁", "🤔"]
```

Using Unicode properties makes your regular expressions more robust and accurate when dealing with internationalized text.

## 6. Optimizing RegExp Performance

While regular expressions are powerful, inefficient expressions can significantly impact performance, especially when dealing with large strings or frequent operations. Here are some tips for optimizing RegExp performance:

- **Be specific:** Avoid overly broad patterns that require backtracking.
- **Use non-capturing groups `(?:...)`:** If you don't need to refer to a group later, use `(?:...)` instead of `(...)` to avoid the overhead of capturing.
- **Anchor patterns:** Use `^` and `$` to anchor patterns to the beginning or end of the string, which can help the engine quickly determine if a match is possible.
- **Avoid unnecessary quantifiers:** Question marks, stars, and plus signs can lead to backtracking. Be mindful of how they are used.
- **Benchmark:** Use performance testing tools to identify bottlenecks and compare different RegExp approaches.
- **Consider alternatives:** Sometimes, string manipulation methods (e.g., `indexOf`, `substring`, `split`) might be faster than complex regular expressions.

**Example: Using non-capturing groups**

```plaintext
const text = "This is a test string.";
const regex = /Th(?:is)\s(?:is)/; // Non-capturing groups
const match = text.match(regex);

console.log(match); // Output: ["This is"]
```

In this example, `(?:is)` is used instead of `(is)` because we don't need to refer to the "is" group later.

## Conclusion

Mastering advanced JavaScript RegExp techniques empowers you to solve complex pattern matching problems with elegance and efficiency. By understanding lookarounds, backreferences, conditional matching (with the caveat of limited support), flags, Unicode character classes, and optimization strategies, you can leverage the full potential of regular expressions in your JavaScript projects. Remember to test your regular expressions thoroughly and choose the best approach based on your specific needs and the target environment. Always prioritize readability and maintainability when writing regular expressions.
