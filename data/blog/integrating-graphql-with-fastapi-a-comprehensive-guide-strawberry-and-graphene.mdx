# Integrating GraphQL with FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide (Strawberry & Graphene)

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.  Combining these two technologies allows you to create powerful, flexible, and efficient APIs.

This guide will walk you through integrating GraphQL with FastAPI using two popular Python GraphQL libraries: Strawberry and Graphene. We'll cover the setup, implementation, and some advanced features to help you build robust GraphQL APIs with FastAPI.

## Why Combine FastAPI and GraphQL?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand why integrating GraphQL with FastAPI is beneficial:

*   **Efficient Data Fetching:** GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.
*   **Strong Typing:** Both FastAPI and GraphQL rely on strong typing, ensuring data consistency and reducing runtime errors.
*   **Flexibility:** GraphQL allows clients to evolve their data requirements without requiring server-side changes.
*   **Developer Experience:** FastAPI provides excellent developer tools and documentation, making it easy to build and maintain APIs.
*   **Performance:** FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities, coupled with GraphQL's efficient data fetching, lead to high-performance APIs.

## Setting Up Your Project

First, let's set up a basic FastAPI project and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
mkdir fastapi-graphql
cd fastapi-graphql
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or . venv/Scripts/activate on Windows
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Now, let's install the GraphQL libraries we'll be using: Strawberry and Graphene.

```bash
pip install strawberry-graphql graphene
```

## Integrating GraphQL with FastAPI using Strawberry

Strawberry is a modern, Pythonic GraphQL library that focuses on simplicity and ease of use. Let's see how to integrate it with FastAPI.

### 1. Defining the GraphQL Schema

First, we need to define our GraphQL schema using Strawberry. Let's create a simple example with a `User` type and a query to fetch a user by ID.

```python title="app/schema.py"
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def user(self, id: int) -> User:
        # In a real application, you would fetch this data from a database.
        users = {
            1: User(id=1, name="John Doe", email="john.doe@example.com"),
            2: User(id=2, name="Jane Smith", email="jane.smith@example.com"),
        }
        return users.get(id)

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

### 2. Integrating with FastAPI

Now, let's integrate the Strawberry schema with our FastAPI application using the `GraphQLRouter`.

```python title="app/main.py"
from fastapi import FastAPI
from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter
from app.schema import schema

graphql_app = GraphQLRouter(schema)

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(graphql_app, prefix="/graphql")


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

```

This code creates a `GraphQLRouter` using our Strawberry schema and mounts it to the `/graphql` endpoint.  It also defines a basic root endpoint for health checks.

### 3. Running the Application

Now you can run the FastAPI application using uvicorn.

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/graphql`. You should see the GraphiQL interface, a powerful in-browser IDE for exploring your GraphQL API.

### 4. Testing the GraphQL API

In the GraphiQL interface, you can write and execute GraphQL queries. For example, to fetch user with ID 1, you can use the following query:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

The response will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Features with Strawberry

*   **Mutations:** Define mutations to modify data. Use the `@strawberry.mutation` decorator.
*   **Subscriptions:** Implement real-time updates using the `@strawberry.subscription` decorator.  Requires a WebSocket integration with FastAPI, usually using a library like `websockets` or `starlette.websockets`.
*   **Data Loaders:** Optimize data fetching using data loaders to avoid the N+1 problem.  Libraries like `aiodataloader` can be used with Strawberry.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Use FastAPI's security features to protect your GraphQL API.  You can inject dependencies into your resolvers for authentication and authorization.

## Integrating GraphQL with FastAPI using Graphene

Graphene is another popular Python GraphQL library that provides a more object-oriented approach to defining schemas.  Let's see how to integrate it with FastAPI.

### 1. Defining the GraphQL Schema

First, we need to define our GraphQL schema using Graphene.

```python title="app/schema_graphene.py"
import graphene

class User(graphene.ObjectType):
    id = graphene.Int()
    name = graphene.String()
    email = graphene.String()

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    user = graphene.Field(User, id=graphene.Int(required=True))

    def resolve_user(self, info, id):
        users = {
            1: User(id=1, name="John Doe", email="john.doe@example.com"),
            2: User(id=2, name="Jane Smith", email="jane.smith@example.com"),
        }
        return users.get(id)

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
```

### 2. Integrating with FastAPI

Now, let's integrate the Graphene schema with our FastAPI application.  We'll need a utility function to execute the GraphQL query and return the results.  We can use `graphene.Schema.execute` for this.  Also, we will use `GraphQLRouter` from `starlette-graphene3` package.

```python title="app/main_graphene.py"
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.graphql import GraphQLApp
from app.schema_graphene import schema

app = FastAPI()

app.add_route("/graphql", GraphQLApp(schema=schema))


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

This code creates a `GraphQLApp` using our Graphene schema and mounts it to the `/graphql` endpoint. It also defines a basic root endpoint for health checks. Note the import `starlette.graphql`.  Starlette is the foundation on which FastAPI is built, making this integration seamless.

### 3. Running the Application

Now you can run the FastAPI application using uvicorn.

```bash
uvicorn app.main_graphene:app --reload
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/graphql`. You should see the GraphiQL interface, a powerful in-browser IDE for exploring your GraphQL API.  If you don't see GraphiQL, you may need to install `graphiql`:

```bash
pip install graphiql
```

### 4. Testing the GraphQL API

In the GraphiQL interface, you can write and execute GraphQL queries. For example, to fetch user with ID 1, you can use the following query:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

The response will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Features with Graphene

*   **Mutations:** Define mutations to modify data by creating mutation classes that inherit from `graphene.Mutation`.
*   **Subscriptions:** Implement real-time updates using libraries like `graphql-ws` or `ariadne` alongside Graphene.
*   **Relay Integration:** Use Graphene Relay for building efficient GraphQL APIs with connections, nodes, and global object identification.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Integrate with FastAPI's security features to protect your GraphQL API, using context and information passed to resolvers.

## Choosing Between Strawberry and Graphene

Both Strawberry and Graphene are excellent choices for integrating GraphQL with FastAPI. Here's a comparison to help you decide which one is right for your project:
