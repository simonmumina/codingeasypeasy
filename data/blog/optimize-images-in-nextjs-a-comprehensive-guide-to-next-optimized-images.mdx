## Installation and Setup

Let's get started with installing and setting up `next-optimized-images` in your Next.js project.

1.  **Install the package:**

    ```bash
    npm install next-optimized-images
    # or
    yarn add next-optimized-images
    ```

2.  **Configure `next.config.js`:**

    Modify your `next.config.js` file to use the `next-optimized-images` plugin.

    ```javascript
    // next.config.js
    const withOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

    module.exports = withOptimizedImages({
      /* config for next-optimized-images */
      optimizeImages: true,
      /* your next.js config here */
    });
    ```

    This minimal configuration enables basic image optimization using the default settings.

3.  **Using Images in your components**

    You can import and use images just as you normally would in Next.js.  For example, placing your images in the `public` directory and then referencing them within your React components.

    ```jsx
    import Image from 'next/image';

    function MyComponent() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Image
            src="/images/my-image.jpg" // Path to your image in the 'public' directory
            alt="A descriptive alt text"
            width={500} // Required
            height={300} // Required
            priority // Optional: true if this image is in the initial viewport.
          />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default MyComponent;
    ```

    **Important Note:** Using the Next.js `<Image>` component is *highly* recommended.  While `next-optimized-images` can process images used in standard `<img>` tags, the `next/image` component provides significant performance benefits out-of-the-box, including automatic image optimization, lazy loading, and improved Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). It's the preferred way to display images in Next.js.

## Basic Usage

Once `next-optimized-images` is configured, it automatically optimizes images during the build process. No changes are needed to your image import statements.  It works seamlessly with the Next.js `Image` component.

## Advanced Configuration Options

`next-optimized-images` offers a wide range of configuration options to fine-tune image optimization according to your specific needs. Let's explore some of the most useful options:

### 1.  Specifying Image Formats

You can specify the image formats you want to generate (e.g., WebP, AVIF) using the `webp` and `avif` options. WebP is supported by most modern browsers, while AVIF offers even better compression but has limited browser support.

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

module.exports = withOptimizedImages({
  optimizeImages: true,
  webp: {
    preset: 'default',
    quality: 75,
  },
  avif: {
    quality: 60,
  },
});
```

This configuration generates WebP images with a quality of 75 and AVIF images with a quality of 60.

### 2.  Responsive Images

You can configure responsive image generation using the `responsive` option. This allows you to generate multiple image sizes for different screen sizes, ensuring optimal display across devices.

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

module.exports = withOptimizedImages({
  optimizeImages: true,
  responsive: {
    adapter: require('responsive-loader/sharp'),
    sizes: [320, 480, 800, 1200],
    placeholder: true,
    placeholderSize: 50,
  },
});
```

*   **`sizes`:** An array of pixel widths to generate.  In this case, it will generate versions of your images at 320px, 480px, 800px, and 1200px wide. The height will be automatically calculated to maintain the aspect ratio.
*   **`placeholder: true`:** Creates a blurry placeholder image to display while the full image is loading. This improves the perceived loading performance and reduces layout shifts.
*   **`placeholderSize`:** Specifies the size (in pixels) of the placeholder image.

You would then need to use the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes within your `next/image` component or use `responsive-loader` directly within your component if you are using the  `<img>` tag (not recommended).  Example of using it with `next/image`:

  ```jsx
  import Image from 'next/image';

  function ResponsiveImageExample() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Image
          src="/images/my-responsive-image.jpg"
          alt="A responsive image"
          width={800}  // Provide *one* width and height. Next.js will handle generating and using the different sizes.
          height={600}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  Next.js handles the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for the generated images based on the configured `sizes`.

### 3.  Custom Optimization

You can configure custom optimization settings for specific image types and formats using the `images` option.  This gives you fine-grained control over the optimization process.

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

module.exports = withOptimizedImages({
  optimizeImages: true,
  images: {
    mozjpeg: {
      quality: 80,
    },
    pngquant: {
      quality: [0.7, 0.8],
    },
  },
});
```

This configuration sets the quality of JPEG images using `mozjpeg` to 80 and the quality range for PNG images using `pngquant` to between 70% and 80%.

### 4.  Disabling Optimization

You can disable optimization for specific images or directories using the `handleImages` option. This can be useful for images that are already optimized or for images that you don't want to be processed.

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

module.exports = withOptimizedImages({
  optimizeImages: true,
  handleImages: ['jpeg', 'png', 'svg', 'gif', 'webp', 'avif'], // Only process these types
});
```

To disable the optimization completely, set `optimizeImages` to `false`.

### 5.  Other Options

*   **`inlineImageLimit`:**  Images smaller than this size (in bytes) will be inlined as data URLs.
*   **`defaultImageLoader`:**  Allows you to specify a custom image loader.
*   **`optimizeImagesInDev`:**  Optimize images in development mode (defaults to `false`).  This is useful for testing but can slow down development builds.

## Examples

Let's look at some practical examples of how to use `next-optimized-images` in your Next.js projects.

**Example 1: Basic Optimization with WebP support:**

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

module.exports = withOptimizedImages({
  optimizeImages: true,
  webp: {
    preset: 'picture', // Uses <picture> tag for WebP support
    quality: 80,
  },
});
```

This configuration enables basic image optimization and generates WebP versions of your images. The `preset: 'picture'` setting tells the plugin to use a `<picture>` element to serve WebP images to browsers that support them, while falling back to the original format for older browsers.

**Example 2: Responsive Images with Placeholders**

```javascript
// next.config.js
const withOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

module.exports = withOptimizedImages({
  optimizeImages: true,
  responsive: {
    adapter: require('responsive-loader/sharp'), // Required!
    sizes: [320, 640, 960, 1200],
    placeholder: true,
    placeholderSize: 50,
  },
});
```

This example configures responsive image generation with placeholders.

**Example 3: Disabling optimization for a specific image**

If you have a specific image that you don't want to be optimized, you can use the `handleImages` option to exclude it.  This would involve more manual control, potentially using conditional rendering or different import strategies. Since `next-optimized-images` largely automates the process at build time, explicitly excluding specific *images* requires careful planning and implementation.  It's often easier to optimize all images and fine-tune the global settings if possible.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter while using `next-optimized-images` and how to resolve them:

*   **Images are not being optimized:**  Double-check your `next.config.js` file to ensure that `next-optimized-images` is correctly configured.  Also, make sure that you are using the correct import statements for your images.  Clean your Next.js cache (`.next` folder) and rebuild the project.
*   **Build errors:**  Build errors can occur if there are issues with the configuration options or if the required dependencies are not installed.  Carefully review your `next.config.js` file and make sure that all necessary packages are installed.
*   **Image quality is poor:**  If the optimized images have poor visual quality, try adjusting the quality settings in the configuration options.  Experiment with different quality values to find the optimal balance between file size and visual quality.
*   **Slow build times:** Image optimization can be a resource-intensive process, which can increase build times. You can try disabling optimization during development or using caching to reduce build times.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using `next-optimized-images`:

*   **Use the Next.js `Image` component:**  This component provides built-in optimizations, lazy loading, and improved layout stability.  It's the preferred way to display images in Next.js.
*   **Choose the right image format:** Use WebP or AVIF for modern browsers and JPEG or PNG for older browsers.
*   **Optimize image quality:**  Find the optimal balance between file size and visual quality.
*   **Use responsive images:**  Generate multiple image sizes for different screen sizes.
*   **Lazy load images:**  Defer image loading until they are visible in the viewport.
*   **Monitor performance:** Regularly monitor your website's performance to identify and address any image-related issues.
*   **Test on different devices:** Ensure that your images look good on different devices and screen sizes.
