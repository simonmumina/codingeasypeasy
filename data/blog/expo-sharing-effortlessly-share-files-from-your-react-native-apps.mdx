# Expo Sharing: Effortlessly Share Files from Your React Native Apps

Sharing files is a common requirement for many mobile applications. Whether it's sharing a PDF document, an image, a video, or any other type of file, providing a simple and intuitive sharing experience is crucial for user engagement. Expo provides a convenient and cross-platform solution for file sharing through its `expo-sharing` library. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to use `expo-sharing` to seamlessly share files from your React Native apps on both iOS and Android.

## What is Expo Sharing?

`expo-sharing` is an Expo library that provides a cross-platform API for sharing files from your React Native apps. It simplifies the process of invoking the native sharing dialog on both iOS and Android, allowing users to easily share files with other applications or contacts. It hides the platform-specific implementations, allowing you to write a single code base for both platforms.

## Why use Expo Sharing?

- **Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android with a single codebase.
- **Simplified API:** Provides a straightforward API for initiating the sharing process.
- **Native Sharing Dialog:** Utilizes the native sharing dialog, ensuring a familiar and consistent user experience.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple to install and integrate into your existing Expo or React Native project.
- **Handles File URIs:** Correctly manages file URIs and ensures compatibility across platforms.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

First, you'll need to install the `expo-sharing` library in your Expo or React Native project. If you're using Expo, the easiest way is:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-sharing
```

If you are using bare React Native project (not Expo), you'll need to follow additional installation steps outlined in the `expo-sharing` documentation for your platform.

### 2. Importing the Module

Import the `shareAsync` function from `expo-sharing`:

```plaintext
import * as Sharing from 'expo-sharing'
```

## Sharing a File

The core function of `expo-sharing` is `shareAsync()`. This function takes the file URI as an argument and opens the native sharing dialog. Let's look at a basic example of sharing a local image file:

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native'
import * as Sharing from 'expo-sharing'
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'

export default function App() {
  const [imageUri, setImageUri] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const downloadImage = async () => {
      try {
        const remoteUrl = 'https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/samples/video-to-gif-sample.gif' // Example GIF
        const localUri = FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'my_gif.gif'
        const { uri } = await FileSystem.downloadAsync(remoteUrl, localUri)
        setImageUri(uri)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error downloading image:', error)
        Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to download the image.')
      }
    }

    downloadImage()
  }, [])

  const shareImage = async () => {
    if (!imageUri) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Image not yet downloaded.')
      return
    }

    try {
      await Sharing.shareAsync(imageUri, { dialogTitle: 'Share this GIF!' })
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sharing image:', error)
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to share the image.')
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Button title="Share GIF" onPress={shareImage} disabled={!imageUri} />
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** We import `Sharing` from `expo-sharing`, `FileSystem` from `expo-file-system` (to download the image), `View`, `Button`, and `Alert` from `react-native`.
2.  **Download Image (useEffect):** We use `useEffect` to download an image from a remote URL to the local file system when the component mounts. We store the local file URI in the `imageUri` state.
3.  **`shareImage` function:**
    - We check if the `imageUri` is available.
    - We call `Sharing.shareAsync(imageUri)` to open the native sharing dialog with the specified file.
    - We catch any potential errors and display an alert.
4.  **Button:** A button is rendered that triggers the `shareImage` function. It is disabled until the image is downloaded.

### Using `shareAsync` Options

The `shareAsync` function accepts an optional second argument, which is an object allowing you to customize the sharing behavior:

- **`dialogTitle`:** (string, optional) A title to display at the top of the sharing dialog.

Let's update the previous example to include the `dialogTitle`:

```plaintext
await Sharing.shareAsync(imageUri, { dialogTitle: 'Share this GIF!' })
```

## Handling Errors

It's important to handle potential errors that might occur during the sharing process. For example, the user might cancel the sharing dialog, or there might be an issue with the file itself. You can catch errors using a `try...catch` block:

```plaintext
try {
  await Sharing.shareAsync(imageUri)
  console.log('File shared successfully!')
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error sharing file:', error)
  Alert.alert('Sharing Error', 'An error occurred while sharing the file.')
}
```

## Sharing Different File Types

`expo-sharing` supports sharing various file types, including:

- Images (PNG, JPG, GIF)
- Videos (MP4, MOV)
- Audio files (MP3, WAV)
- Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Other arbitrary files

The important thing is to ensure that the file URI you provide to `shareAsync` is valid and accessible by the operating system.

## Sharing Files from Base64 Encoded Data

If you have file data in base64 format, you'll need to first write it to a file on the device's file system before you can share it using `expo-sharing`. Here's how you can do it:

```plaintext
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'
import * as Sharing from 'expo-sharing'

const shareBase64Data = async (base64Data, filename, fileExtension) => {
  try {
    const fileUri = FileSystem.documentDirectory + filename + '.' + fileExtension

    // Write the base64 data to the file
    await FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync(fileUri, base64Data, {
      encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64,
    })

    // Share the file
    await Sharing.shareAsync(fileUri, { dialogTitle: 'Share ' + filename })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sharing base64 data:', error)
    Alert.alert('Sharing Error', 'An error occurred while sharing the data.')
  }
}

// Example Usage:
// const base64String = "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w+j+wL0jwDEsbQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="; // Example Base64 String (Small transparent PNG)
// shareBase64Data(base64String, "my_image", "png");
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`shareBase64Data` function:** This function takes the base64 encoded data, the filename, and the file extension as arguments.
2.  **Generate File URI:** We create a file URI in the device's document directory with the provided filename and extension.
3.  **Write Base64 Data to File:** We use `FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync` to write the base64 data to the file. Crucially, we specify the `encoding` option as `FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64`.
4.  **Share the File:** We call `Sharing.shareAsync` with the generated file URI to open the native sharing dialog.
5.  **Error Handling:** We include a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors.

**Important Considerations for Base64 Sharing:**

- **File Size:** Be mindful of the file size when dealing with base64 data. Large files can take a considerable amount of time to write to the file system.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the device's file system.
- **Data Integrity:** Double-check that the base64 data is correctly encoded and decoded.

## Best Practices

- **Check for Availability:** Before attempting to share a file, use `Sharing.isAvailableAsync()` to check if sharing is supported on the current device. This is especially important on platforms that might not have native sharing capabilities.

  ```plaintext
  const checkSharingAvailability = async () => {
    const isAvailable = await Sharing.isAvailableAsync()
    if (!isAvailable) {
      Alert.alert('Sharing Not Available', 'Sharing is not supported on this device.')
    }
    return isAvailable
  }

  // Usage:
  if (await checkSharingAvailability()) {
    // Proceed with sharing
  }
  ```

- **Provide Clear Feedback:** Inform the user about the progress of the sharing operation, especially when dealing with large files. You can display a loading indicator or a progress bar.
- **Handle Cancellations:** Be prepared for the user to cancel the sharing dialog. You can optionally track whether the sharing operation was successful or canceled.
- **Use a Consistent UI:** Maintain a consistent user interface for sharing throughout your app. Use the same style of buttons, icons, and messages.
