# Monitoring Express.js Apps in Production: New Relic vs. Prometheus + Grafana

Ensuring the health and performance of your Express.js applications in production is crucial for a smooth user experience and efficient resource utilization.  Without proper monitoring, you're essentially flying blind, unable to identify bottlenecks, errors, or security vulnerabilities. This article provides a deep dive into two popular approaches: using New Relic and using Prometheus coupled with Grafana. We'll explore their strengths, weaknesses, and provide practical code examples to get you started.

## Why Monitor Your Express.js App?

Before diving into the specifics, let's highlight why monitoring is so important:

*   **Identify Performance Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint slow routes, database queries, or external API calls that impact application speed.
*   **Error Detection and Resolution:**  Quickly identify and resolve errors, minimizing downtime and user frustration.
*   **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage to optimize resource allocation and prevent crashes.

*   **Vendor Lock-in:** Tightly integrated platform can make it difficult to switch to alternative solutions.
*   **Data Privacy Considerations:**  Data is stored and processed by a third-party vendor.

**Setting up New Relic for Express.js:**

1.  **Create a New Relic Account:** Sign up for a free trial or a paid plan at [newrelic.com](https://newrelic.com/).
2.  **Install the New Relic Agent:** Install the `newrelic` package using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install newrelic --save
    ```

3.  **Configure the Agent:** Create a `newrelic.js` file in the root directory of your project.  This file contains your New Relic license key and application name.  Replace `<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>` and `<YOUR_APP_NAME>` with your actual values.

    ```javascript
    'use strict'
    /**
     * New Relic agent configuration.
     *
     * See lib/config.defaults.js in the agent distribution for a more complete
     * list of configuration variables and their potential values.
     */
    exports.config = {
      /**
       * Array of application names.
       */
      app_name: ['<YOUR_APP_NAME>'],
      /**
       * Your New Relic license key.
       */
      license_key: '<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>',
      logging: {
        /**
         * Level at which to log. 'trace' is most useful to New Relic when diagnosing
         * issues with the agent, 'info' and higher will impose a smaller performance
         * penalty.
         */
        level: 'info'
      },
      /**
       * When true, all request headers except for those listed in attributes.exclude
       * will be sent to New Relic.
       */
      allow_all_headers: true,
      attributes: {
        /**
         * Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows filtering
         * of unwanted data.
         *
         * @env NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE
         */
        exclude: [
          'request.headers.cookie',
          'request.headers.authorization',
          'request.headers.proxyAuthorization',
          'request.headers.setCookie*',
          'request.headers.x*',
          'response.headers.cookie',
          'response.headers.authorization',
          'response.headers.proxyAuthorization',
          'response.headers.setCookie*'
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Require the Agent:** Add the following line to the very top of your main application file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`):

    ```javascript
    require('newrelic'); // Must be the first line
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
    });
    ```

5.  **Deploy and Monitor:** Deploy your application and start monitoring its performance in the New Relic dashboard.  You should start seeing data flowing into your New Relic account within a few minutes.

**Custom Instrumentation:**

While New Relic automatically instruments many aspects of your application, you may need to add custom instrumentation to monitor specific functions or code blocks.  Here's an example of how to create a custom transaction:

```javascript
const newrelic = require('newrelic');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/custom-transaction', (req, res) => {
  newrelic.startWebTransaction('CustomTransactionExample', function() {
    // Your code here
    setTimeout(() => {
      res.send('Custom Transaction Example');
      newrelic.endTransaction();
    }, 100);
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

You can also use `newrelic.recordCustomEvent` to record custom events for analysis:

```javascript
const newrelic = require('newrelic');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/record-event', (req, res) => {
  newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', {
    attribute1: 'value1',
    attribute2: 123
  });
  res.send('Event recorded!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});
```

## Option 2: Prometheus + Grafana - The Open-Source Powerhouse

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It excels at collecting and storing time-series data, which is ideal for monitoring application performance. Grafana is an open-source data visualization and dashboarding tool that integrates seamlessly with Prometheus.  Together, they provide a powerful and flexible monitoring solution.

*   **No Vendor Lock-in:**  You control your data and infrastructure.

**Cons of Prometheus + Grafana:**

*   **Steeper Learning Curve:**  Requires more technical expertise to set up and configure.
*   **Requires Infrastructure:**  You need to manage your own Prometheus and Grafana servers.
*   **Manual Instrumentation:** Requires more manual effort to instrument your application.
*   **Configuration Overhead:** Configuration can be complex, especially for advanced use cases.

**Setting up Prometheus and Grafana for Express.js:**

1.  **Install Prometheus and Grafana:** Download and install Prometheus and Grafana from their respective websites: [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io/) and [grafana.com](https://grafana.com/).  You can also use Docker to run them in containers.  Refer to their documentation for detailed installation instructions.

2.  **Install Prometheus Client for Node.js:** Install the `prom-client` package:

    ```bash
    npm install prom-client --save
    ```

3.  **Expose Prometheus Metrics:** Create an endpoint in your Express.js application to expose Prometheus metrics.  Here's a basic example:

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const client = require('prom-client');

    const app = express();

    // Create a Prometheus registry
    const register = new client.Registry();

    // Define some metrics
    const httpRequestDurationMicroseconds = new client.Histogram({
      name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
      help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
      labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
      buckets: [0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10], // Example buckets
    });
    register.registerMetric(httpRequestDurationMicroseconds);

    const httpRequestsTotal = new client.Counter({
      name: 'http_requests_total',
      help: 'Total number of HTTP requests',
      labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
    });
    register.registerMetric(httpRequestsTotal);

    // Middleware to track request duration and count
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      const start = Date.now();
      res.on('finish', () => {
        const duration = (Date.now() - start) / 1000; // Duration in seconds
        const route = req.route ? req.route.path : 'unknown'; // Get the route path
        const statusCode = res.statusCode;

        httpRequestDurationMicroseconds.labels(req.method, route, statusCode).observe(duration);
        httpRequestsTotal.labels(req.method, route, statusCode).inc();
      });
      next();
    });

    // Define some routes
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Test Endpoint');
    });


    // Expose the Prometheus metrics endpoint
    app.get('/metrics', async (req, res) => {
      try {
        res.set('Content-Type', register.contentType);
        res.end(await register.metrics());
      } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).end(err);
      }
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
    });
    ```

4.  **Configure Prometheus to Scrape Metrics:** Configure Prometheus to scrape the `/metrics` endpoint of your Express.js application.  Edit your `prometheus.yml` configuration file (typically located in the Prometheus installation directory) and add a job configuration like this:

    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'express-app'
        scrape_interval: 5s
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:3000'] # Replace with your application's address
            labels:
              environment: 'production'
    ```

5.  **Start Prometheus:** Start the Prometheus server.

6.  **Configure Grafana to Use Prometheus as a Data Source:** In Grafana, add Prometheus as a data source.  Go to "Configuration" -> "Data Sources" and select "Prometheus."  Enter the Prometheus server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`).

7.  **Create Grafana Dashboards:** Create Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.  You can use the Prometheus query language (PromQL) to create custom queries and visualizations.  Here are some example PromQL queries:

    *   **Average request duration:** `rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])`
    *   **Requests per second:** `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
    *   **Error rate (5xx status codes):** `sum(rate(http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))`

    You can import pre-built Grafana dashboards for Node.js and Express.js from the Grafana dashboard marketplace.

**Custom Metrics:**

You can create custom metrics to track application-specific data. The `prom-client` library provides various metric types, including:

*   **Counter:**  A metric that only increases.
*   **Gauge:** A metric that can increase or decrease.
*   **Histogram:**  A metric that tracks the distribution of values.
*   **Summary:**  Similar to a histogram but calculates quantiles directly.

Refer to the `prom-client` documentation for more details on creating and using custom metrics.
