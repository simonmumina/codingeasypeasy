# Implementing WebSockets with NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide (@nestjs/websockets, Socket.IO)

WebSockets are a powerful technology for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server. They provide a persistent connection, allowing data to be pushed from the server to the client without the need for constant polling or HTTP requests. This makes them ideal for applications like chat applications, online games, and live data dashboards.

NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications, provides excellent support for WebSockets through the `@nestjs/websockets` package and integration with popular libraries like Socket.IO.

This guide will walk you through the process of implementing WebSockets in a NestJS application, covering everything from setting up your project to handling different types of WebSocket events.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** (preferably the latest LTS version)
- **npm or yarn:** (Node.js package managers)
- **Nest CLI:** Install globally using `npm i -g @nestjs/cli` or `yarn global add @nestjs/cli`

## Setting Up a NestJS Project

Let's start by creating a new NestJS project using the Nest CLI:

```plaintext
nest new nestjs-websockets-example
```

Choose your preferred package manager (npm or yarn) when prompted.

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```plaintext
cd nestjs-websockets-example
```

## Installing Dependencies

Now, we need to install the necessary dependencies for WebSockets:

```plaintext
npm install --save @nestjs/platform-socket.io @nestjs/websockets socket.io socket.io-client
# or
yarn add @nestjs/platform-socket.io @nestjs/websockets socket.io socket.io-client
```

Here's what these packages do:

- `@nestjs/platform-socket.io`: Provides the Socket.IO platform adapter for NestJS.
- `@nestjs/websockets`: Offers decorators and utilities for working with WebSockets in NestJS.
- `socket.io`: The core Socket.IO library.
- `socket.io-client`: Socket.IO client for frontend implementation (we'll use this later).

## Creating a WebSocket Gateway

A WebSocket gateway is a class that handles WebSocket connections and events. Let's create a gateway called `events`:

```plaintext
nest g gateway events
```

This command generates two files: `src/events/events.gateway.ts` and `src/events/events.module.ts`.

Open `src/events/events.gateway.ts` and modify it to look like this:

```plaintext
import {
  WebSocketGateway,
  SubscribeMessage,
  MessageBody,
  ConnectedSocket,
  WebSocketServer,
} from '@nestjs/websockets'
import { Server, Socket } from 'socket.io'

@WebSocketGateway({
  cors: {
    origin: '*', // Adjust this for production!  Be specific about your origins.
  },
})
export class EventsGateway {
  @WebSocketServer()
  server: Server

  @SubscribeMessage('message')
  handleMessage(@MessageBody() data: string, @ConnectedSocket() client: Socket) {
    console.log('Received message from client:', data)
    this.server.emit('message', { data, clientId: client.id }) // Broadcast to all clients
    return 'Hello world!' // Optional: Send a response back to the client
  }

  handleConnection(client: Socket, ...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Client connected: ${client.id}`)
    this.server.emit('userConnected', { clientId: client.id }) // Notify other clients of a new connection
  }

  handleDisconnect(client: Socket) {
    console.log(`Client disconnected: ${client.id}`)
    this.server.emit('userDisconnected', { clientId: client.id }) // Notify other clients of a disconnection
  }
}
```

Let's break down this code:

- `@WebSocketGateway()`: This decorator marks the class as a WebSocket gateway. The `cors` option allows you to specify the allowed origins for WebSocket connections. **Important:** In a production environment, you should replace `'*'` with a specific list of allowed origins to prevent security vulnerabilities.

- `@WebSocketServer() server: Server;`: Injects the Socket.IO server instance into the gateway. We use this to emit events to clients.

- `@SubscribeMessage('message')`: This decorator tells NestJS to listen for messages with the event name `message`.

  - `@MessageBody() data: string`: Extracts the message payload from the incoming event. We've typed this as a string, but you can use interfaces/types for more complex data structures.
  - `@ConnectedSocket() client: Socket`: Injects the `Socket` object representing the client connection. We can use this to identify individual clients.

- `handleMessage(data: string, client: Socket)`: This function handles the `message` event. It logs the received message to the console and then uses `this.server.emit('message', { data, clientId: client.id })` to broadcast the message to all connected clients, including the sender. The `clientId` allows the clients to identify the sender. It also returns a simple string 'Hello world!' as a response back to the client. This is optional, and you can omit the return value if you don't need to send a response.

- `handleConnection(client: Socket, ...args: any[])`: This method is automatically called when a new client connects to the WebSocket server. We log the client ID and emit a `userConnected` event to all other clients to notify them of the new connection.

- `handleDisconnect(client: Socket)`: This method is called when a client disconnects from the WebSocket server. We log the client ID and emit a `userDisconnected` event to all other clients.

## Importing the Events Module

Now, we need to import the `EventsModule` into our main application module (`app.module.ts`). Open `src/app.module.ts` and update it as follows:

```plaintext
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'
import { EventsModule } from './events/events.module'

@Module({
  imports: [EventsModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

By importing `EventsModule`, we register the `EventsGateway` and make it available for handling WebSocket connections.

## Running the Application

Now you can start the NestJS application:

```plaintext
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
```

This will start the server in development mode, with automatic hot reloading. By default, NestJS runs on port 3000.

## Client-Side Implementation (Socket.IO Client)

To test our WebSocket server, we need a client that can connect to it and send/receive messages. Let's create a simple HTML page with JavaScript to do this. Create a new file called `index.html` in the root of your project directory (or in a `public` directory if you are serving static files):

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>WebSocket Client</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>WebSocket Client</h1>

    <input type="text" id="messageInput" placeholder="Enter message" />
    <button id="sendButton">Send</button>

    <ul id="messages"></ul>

    <script
      src="https://cdn.socket.io/4.7.2/socket.io.min.js"
      integrity="sha384-MZTJczjhkW0XUj+jKxMvA+Qe+W+r9QGj456Og5wQ1/jS2+9rpbw4M2qQ3g9D3H"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    ></script>
    <script>
      const socket = io('http://localhost:3000') // Replace with your server address

      const messageInput = document.getElementById('messageInput')
      const sendButton = document.getElementById('sendButton')
      const messagesList = document.getElementById('messages')

      socket.on('connect', () => {
        console.log('Connected to server')
      })

      socket.on('message', (data) => {
        const message = `Client ${data.clientId}: ${data.data}`
        const listItem = document.createElement('li')
        listItem.textContent = message
        messagesList.appendChild(listItem)
      })

      socket.on('userConnected', (data) => {
        const message = `User ${data.clientId} connected`
        const listItem = document.createElement('li')
        listItem.textContent = message
        messagesList.appendChild(listItem)
      })

      socket.on('userDisconnected', (data) => {
        const message = `User ${data.clientId} disconnected`
        const listItem = document.createElement('li')
        listItem.textContent = message
        messagesList.appendChild(listItem)
      })

      sendButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const message = messageInput.value
        socket.emit('message', message)
        messageInput.value = ''
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This HTML page includes:

- A text input field for entering messages.
- A button to send messages.
- A list to display received messages.
- The Socket.IO client library (loaded from a CDN).
- JavaScript code to:
  - Connect to the WebSocket server.
  - Listen for `message`, `userConnected`, and `userDisconnected` events.
  - Display received messages in the list.
  - Send messages when the "Send" button is clicked.

Open `index.html` in your browser. You can open multiple browser windows or tabs to simulate multiple clients. Type a message in the input field and click "Send". You should see the message appear in the list in all connected browser windows, along with connection and disconnection notifications. Check your NestJS server console as well, you should see the `console.log` statements from the server there too.

## Key Concepts and Considerations

- **Namespaces:** Socket.IO allows you to create namespaces, which are logical channels for communication. You can use namespaces to isolate different parts of your application or to create separate chat rooms. To use namespaces, specify the `namespace` option in the `@WebSocketGateway` decorator:

  ```plaintext
  @WebSocketGateway({ namespace: 'chat' })
  export class ChatGateway { ... }
  ```

  On the client-side, you would connect to the namespace like this:

  ```plaintext
  const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/chat')
  ```

- **Rooms:** Within a namespace, you can further organize clients into rooms. Clients can join and leave rooms, allowing you to target specific groups of users with messages. You can use the `join` and `leave` methods on the `Socket` object to manage rooms.

  ```plaintext
  @SubscribeMessage('joinRoom')
  handleJoinRoom(@MessageBody() room: string, @ConnectedSocket() client: Socket) {
    client.join(room);
    this.server.to(room).emit('userJoined', { clientId: client.id, room }); // Notify users in the room
  }
  ```

  On the client-side:

  ```plaintext
  socket.emit('joinRoom', 'my-room')
  ```

- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling in your WebSocket gateway to gracefully handle unexpected errors. You can use the `try...catch` block and emit error events to the clients.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** For secure applications, you need to authenticate and authorize WebSocket connections. You can use middleware to verify user credentials and assign roles. Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

- **Scalability:** When scaling your WebSocket application, consider using a message queue (like Redis or RabbitMQ) to distribute messages across multiple server instances. Socket.IO provides adapters for these message queues.

- **Security:** Always sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Validate and sanitize data received from clients before processing it. Use secure WebSocket (WSS) for encrypted communication. Remember the `cors` setting - restrict allowed origins to known, trusted domains.

## Advanced Topics

- **Middleware:** You can use NestJS middleware to intercept WebSocket connections and events. This allows you to perform tasks like authentication, logging, and validation before the events reach the gateway.

- **Guards:** NestJS guards can be used to control access to WebSocket event handlers. You can create custom guards to check user roles or permissions before allowing access to specific events.

- **Interceptors:** Interceptors can be used to transform the data before it's sent to the client or after it's received from the client. This can be useful for formatting data, adding headers, or logging requests.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided a comprehensive overview of implementing WebSockets with NestJS using `@nestjs/websockets` and Socket.IO.
