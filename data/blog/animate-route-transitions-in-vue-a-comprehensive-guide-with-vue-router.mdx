# Animate Route Transitions in Vue: A Comprehensive Guide with Vue Router

Creating smooth and visually appealing route transitions can significantly enhance the user experience of your Vue.js application.  A well-designed animation between routes makes navigation feel more fluid and engaging.  This guide will walk you through the process of implementing route transitions using Vue Router and CSS animations.  We'll cover different approaches, from basic fades to more complex custom animations.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):**  You'll need these for running Vue CLI and managing dependencies.
*   **Vue CLI installed:**  `npm install -g @vue/cli`
*   **A basic Vue.js project set up:**  If you don't have one, create one using `vue create my-vue-app`

## Setting up Vue Router

First, let's install Vue Router if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install vue-router@4
# or
yarn add vue-router@4
```

Now, create a `router.js` file in your `src` directory (or wherever you prefer) and configure your routes:

```javascript title="src/router.js"
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import Home from './components/Home.vue';
import About from './components/About.vue';
import Contact from './components/Contact.vue'; // Example route

const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home },
  { path: '/about', component: About },
  { path: '/contact', component: Contact }, // Example route
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
});

export default router;
```

Create the `Home.vue`, `About.vue`, and `Contact.vue` components (or your own components) with some basic content.

Finally, import the router in your `main.js` and use it:

```javascript title="src/main.js"
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router';

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(router);
app.mount('#app');
```

In your `App.vue` template, add the `<router-view>` component where your routed content should render:

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <nav>
    <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/about">About</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/contact">Contact</router-link>
  </nav>
  <router-view></router-view>
</template>
```

At this point, you should have a basic Vue application with routing set up.  Clicking the links in the navigation should navigate between the different components.

## Basic Route Transitions with `<transition>`

Vue provides the `<transition>` component, which is the primary tool for adding animations to elements entering and leaving the DOM.  We can wrap the `<router-view>` with a `<transition>` component to animate route transitions.

Here's how to add a simple fade-in/fade-out animation:

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <nav>
    <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/about">About</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/contact">Contact</router-link>
  </nav>

  <transition name="fade" mode="out-in">
    <router-view></router-view>
  </transition>
</template>

<style scoped>
/*  Fade transition */
.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
}

.fade-enter-from,
.fade-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`<transition name="fade" mode="out-in">`**:  This wraps the `<router-view>` with a `<transition>` component.  The `name="fade"` attribute tells Vue to look for CSS classes with the prefix `fade-`.  The `mode="out-in"` attribute ensures that the current route transitions out before the new route transitions in, preventing visual overlap. Other useful modes are `in-out` and `default`.
*   **`.fade-enter-active, .fade-leave-active`**:  These classes are applied during the entire entering/leaving transition. We define the `transition` property here.
*   **`.fade-enter-from, .fade-leave-to`**:  These classes are applied *before* the element enters/leaves.  We set `opacity: 0` to make the element initially invisible for the fade-in and finally invisible for the fade-out.

When you navigate between routes, you should now see a smooth fade transition.

## Understanding Transition Classes

Vue dynamically adds and removes several CSS classes during the transition process. Understanding these classes is crucial for creating more complex animations:

*   **`v-enter-from`**: Applied before the element is inserted into the DOM.  Use this to define the initial state of the entering animation.
*   **`v-enter-active`**: Applied during the entire entering animation. Use this to define the transition duration and easing function.
*   **`v-enter-to`**: Applied after the element has been inserted into the DOM and the entering animation has completed.  Use this to define the final state of the entering animation.
*   **`v-leave-from`**: Applied before the element is removed from the DOM. Use this to define the initial state of the leaving animation.
*   **`v-leave-active`**: Applied during the entire leaving animation. Use this to define the transition duration and easing function.
*   **`v-leave-to`**: Applied after the element has been removed from the DOM and the leaving animation has completed. Use this to define the final state of the leaving animation.

(Replace `v` with the `name` attribute you specify on the `<transition>` component - in our case, it's `fade`).

## More Advanced Route Transitions

Let's create a slide-in/slide-out animation. This will provide a more dynamic feel to your navigation.

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <nav>
    <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/about">About</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/contact">Contact</router-link>
  </nav>

  <transition name="slide" mode="out-in">
    <router-view></router-view>
  </transition>
</template>

<style scoped>
/* Slide transition */
.slide-enter-active,
.slide-leave-active {
  transition: all 0.5s;
  position: absolute; /*  Important for sliding transitions */
  width: 100%;
}

.slide-enter-from {
  transform: translateX(100%);
}

.slide-leave-to {
  transform: translateX(-100%);
}
</style>
```

**Important Considerations for Slide Transitions:**

*   **`position: absolute;`**:  This is crucial. Without it, the elements won't slide properly because they will be stacking on top of each other instead of moving in the same plane.  It's important to set the `width` as well to ensure the absolutely positioned elements occupy the full viewport.
*   **`overflow: hidden` on Parent**: You may need to set `overflow: hidden` on a parent element (often the `body` or a container around your app) to prevent horizontal scrollbars from appearing during the transition.

This example slides the new content in from the right and the old content out to the left.  You can adjust the `translateX` values and the transition properties to achieve different effects.

## Dynamic Transitions Based on Route

Sometimes you might want different transitions depending on the routes being navigated to and from. Vue Router provides access to the previous and next routes, allowing you to conditionally apply different transition names.

First, we need to access the current and previous route:

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <nav>
    <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/about">About</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/contact">Contact</router-link>
  </nav>

  <transition :name="transitionName" mode="out-in">
    <router-view></router-view>
  </transition>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, watch } from 'vue';
import { useRoute, useRouter } from 'vue-router';

export default {
  setup() {
    const route = useRoute();
    const router = useRouter();
    const transitionName = ref('fade'); // Default transition

    watch(
      () => route.path,
      (newPath, oldPath) => {
        if (oldPath === '/') {
          if (newPath === '/about') {
            transitionName.value = 'slide-left';
          } else if (newPath === '/contact') {
            transitionName.value = 'slide-right';
          } else {
             transitionName.value = 'fade';
          }
        } else if (oldPath === '/about') {
          if (newPath === '/') {
            transitionName.value = 'slide-right';
          } else {
             transitionName.value = 'fade';
          }
        } else if (oldPath === '/contact') {
          if (newPath === '/') {
            transitionName.value = 'slide-left';
          } else {
             transitionName.value = 'fade';
          }
        }
        else {
          transitionName.value = 'fade';
        }
      }
    );

    return { transitionName };
  },
};
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Fade transition */
.fade-enter-active,
.fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
}

.fade-enter-from,
.fade-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}

/* Slide-left transition */
.slide-left-enter-active,
.slide-left-leave-active {
  transition: all 0.5s;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
}

.slide-left-enter-from {
  transform: translateX(100%);
}

.slide-left-leave-to {
  transform: translateX(-100%);
}

/* Slide-right transition */
.slide-right-enter-active,
.slide-right-leave-active {
  transition: all 0.5s;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
}

.slide-right-enter-from {
  transform: translateX(-100%);
}

.slide-right-leave-to {
  transform: translateX(100%);
}
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`useRoute` and `useRouter`**: We import `useRoute` and `useRouter` from `vue-router` to access the current route and the router instance.
*   **`transitionName = ref('fade')`**:  We use a `ref` to store the name of the transition. We initialize it with `'fade'` as the default transition.
*   **`watch(() => route.path, ...)`**: We use `watch` to react to changes in the route path.  Whenever the route changes, the callback function is executed.
*   **Conditional Transition Logic**:  Inside the callback, we use `if` statements to determine which transition to use based on the `oldPath` (previous route) and `newPath` (current route).  For example, if navigating from the Home page (`/`) to the About page (`/about`), we set the `transitionName` to `'slide-left'`.
*   **Binding `:name="transitionName"`**:  We bind the `name` attribute of the `<transition>` component to the `transitionName` ref. This allows us to dynamically change the transition based on the current route.

Now, navigating from Home to About will use the `slide-left` animation, while other route transitions will use the default `fade` animation. You can expand on this logic to create more complex and context-aware transitions.

## Using JavaScript Hooks for More Control

The `<transition>` component also provides JavaScript hooks that allow you to execute custom JavaScript code at different stages of the transition.  This gives you even finer-grained control over the animation process.

The available hooks are:

*   `before-enter(el)`: Called before the element is inserted.
*   `enter(el, done)`: Called when the element is being inserted.
*   `after-enter(el)`: Called when the element has been inserted.
*   `enter-cancelled(el)`: Called when the enter transition is cancelled.
*   `before-leave(el)`: Called before the element is removed.
*   `leave(el, done)`: Called when the element is being removed.
*   `after-leave(el)`: Called when the element has been removed.
*   `leave-cancelled(el)`: Called when the leave transition is cancelled.

The `el` argument is the DOM element being transitioned. The `done` argument is a callback function that you *must* call when the transition is complete, especially when using JavaScript animations.

Here's an example of using the JavaScript hooks to animate the height of an element:

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<template>
  <nav>
    <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/about">About</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/contact">Contact</router-link>
  </nav>

  <transition
    @before-enter="beforeEnter"
    @enter="enter"
    @after-enter="afterEnter"
    @leave="leave"
    @after-leave="afterLeave"
  >
    <router-view></router-view>
  </transition>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

export default {
  setup() {
    const route = useRoute();
    const elementRef = ref(null); // Create a ref for the element

    const beforeEnter = (el) => {
      // Set initial height to 0
      el.style.height = '0';
      elRef = el;
    };

    const enter = (el, done) => {
      // Animate height using JavaScript
      requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        el.style.transition = 'height 0.5s ease-in-out';
        el.style.height = el.scrollHeight + 'px';

        el.addEventListener('transitionend', () => {
          done(); // Call done() when the transition is complete
        });
      });
    };

    const afterEnter = (el) => {
      // Reset inline styles after transition
      el.style.height = null; // Let content define the height
      el.style.transition = null;
    };

    const leave = (el, done) => {
      // Set initial height to current height
      el.style.height = el.scrollHeight + 'px';

      requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        el.style.transition = 'height 0.5s ease-in-out';
        el.style.height = '0';

        el.addEventListener('transitionend', () => {
          done();
        });
      });
    };

    const afterLeave = (el) => {
      el.style.height = null;
      el.style.transition = null;
    };

    return { beforeEnter, enter, afterEnter, leave, afterLeave };
  },
};
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Optional styles for content */
.router-view {
  overflow: hidden; /* Important to hide content during animation */
}
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Hook Bindings:**  We bind the JavaScript hooks using `@before-enter`, `@enter`, `@after-enter`, `@leave`, and `@after-leave`.
*   **`beforeEnter(el)`**: Sets the initial height of the element to 0 before the transition starts.
*   **`enter(el, done)`**:  Starts the height animation. We use `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure the animation is smooth.  We also add a `transitionend` event listener to call the `done()` callback when the animation is complete.
*   **`afterEnter(el)`**: Resets the inline styles after the transition to allow the element's height to be determined by its content.
*   **`leave(el, done)`**: Starts the height animation to 0. Similar to `enter`, we use `requestAnimationFrame` and a `transitionend` event listener.
*   **`afterLeave(el)`**: Resets the inline styles after the transition.
*   **`done()` Callback**:  This is crucial. Vue needs to know when your JavaScript animation is finished. Failing to call `done()` will prevent Vue from completing the transition process.
*  **`overflow: hidden`**: Set the `overflow: hidden` css property to the element that is being animated to hide content during the animation.

This example animates the height of the `<router-view>`, making it expand and collapse as you navigate between routes.  You can use these hooks to perform any kind of JavaScript-based animation, giving you maximum flexibility.

## Using Third-Party Animation Libraries

For more complex animations, consider using third-party animation libraries like:

*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):**  A powerful and versatile JavaScript animation library.
*   **Anime.js:**  A lightweight and flexible JavaScript animation library.
*   **Velocity.js:**  An animation engine with similar syntax to jQuery's `$.animate()`.

These libraries provide a wide range of animation features and can significantly simplify the process of creating complex transitions.  To use them, install the library with npm or yarn and then integrate it into your JavaScript hooks. For instance, you can use `GSAP` to animate in the `enter` and `leave` hooks.  Remember to still call the `done()` callback when using JS-based animations.

## SEO Considerations

While animations enhance user experience, be mindful of their impact on SEO.

*   **Keep animations short and subtle:**  Long, complex animations can slow down page load times, negatively affecting your search engine ranking.
*   **Ensure content is still accessible:**  Animations should not obscure or prevent users and search engine crawlers from accessing the content on your page.
*   **Use CSS animations where possible:**  CSS animations are generally more performant than JavaScript-based animations and are preferred for simple transitions.
*   **Test on mobile:** Ensure animations are optimized for mobile devices to avoid performance issues.

## Conclusion

Animating route transitions in Vue.js can significantly improve the user experience of your application. By using the `<transition>` component, understanding transition classes, dynamically applying transitions based on route, leveraging JavaScript hooks, and considering SEO best practices, you can create smooth, engaging, and search engine-friendly navigation.  Experiment with different animation techniques to find the best fit for your application's design and functionality. Remember to prioritize performance and accessibility when implementing animations to ensure a positive user experience for everyone.
