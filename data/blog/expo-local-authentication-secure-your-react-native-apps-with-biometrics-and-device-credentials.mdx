# Expo Local Authentication: Secure Your React Native Apps with Biometrics & Device Credentials

In today's mobile-first world, security is paramount. Users expect their sensitive data to be protected, and developers must implement robust authentication mechanisms to safeguard their applications. `expo-local-authentication` is a powerful Expo library that allows you to easily integrate device-level authentication (fingerprint, Face ID, passcode) into your React Native applications. This guide will walk you through the process, providing code examples and best practices along the way.

## What is `expo-local-authentication`?

`expo-local-authentication` provides a JavaScript API to access the device's local authentication features. This enables you to:

- **Authenticate users using biometrics:** Utilize fingerprint scanning (Touch ID) or facial recognition (Face ID) for secure and convenient login.
- **Fallback to device passcode:** When biometrics are unavailable or fail, gracefully fallback to the device's passcode or PIN for authentication.
- **Enhance security:** Protect sensitive data and operations within your app by requiring local authentication.
- **Improve user experience:** Offer a fast and seamless authentication process compared to traditional username/password logins.

## Why Use Local Authentication?

- **Increased Security:** Device-level authentication is generally more secure than password-based authentication, as it relies on unique biometric data or device credentials.
- **Improved User Experience:** Biometric authentication is faster and more convenient for users than entering passwords.
- **Compliance with Security Standards:** Using local authentication can help you comply with industry security standards and regulations.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Access:** Protect sensitive features and data from unauthorized access.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

First, install the `expo-local-authentication` library in your Expo project:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-local-authentication
```

### 2. Permissions

For Android, ensure you have the `USE_FINGERPRINT` permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`. Expo automatically manages this for you if the correct configuration is used. For iOS, no specific permissions are needed in the `Info.plist` besides the message shown to the user when prompting for authentication, which you'll configure in your code.

### 3. Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of how to check if local authentication is available and authenticate the user:

```plaintext
import * as LocalAuthentication from 'expo-local-authentication'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [isBiometricAvailable, setIsBiometricAvailable] = useState(false)
  const [hasHardwareAsync, setHasHardwareAsync] = useState(false)
  const [biometryType, setBiometryType] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      const compatible = await LocalAuthentication.hasHardwareAsync()
      setHasHardwareAsync(compatible)

      const isEnrolled = await LocalAuthentication.isEnrolledAsync()
      setIsBiometricAvailable(isEnrolled)

      const biometricTypeResult = await LocalAuthentication.supportedAuthenticationTypesAsync()
      if (biometricTypeResult.length > 0) {
        setBiometryType(biometricTypeResult[0])
      }
    })()
  }, [])

  const authenticate = async () => {
    const result = await LocalAuthentication.authenticateAsync({
      promptMessage: 'Authenticate to access the app', // iOS message
      fallbackLabel: 'Use Passcode', // iOS (if no biometrics available)
      cancelLabel: 'Cancel', // Android
    })

    if (result.success) {
      Alert.alert('Authentication Successful', 'You are now authenticated!')
      // Navigate to the protected area of your app
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Authentication Failed', result.error)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Local Authentication Example</Text>
      {hasHardwareAsync ? (
        <>
          <Text>Hardware Available</Text>
          {isBiometricAvailable ? (
            <>
              <Text>Biometrics Available</Text>
              {biometryType === LocalAuthentication.AuthenticationType.FINGERPRINT && (
                <Text>Biometry Type: Fingerprint</Text>
              )}
              {biometryType === LocalAuthentication.AuthenticationType.FACIAL_RECOGNITION && (
                <Text>Biometry Type: Face ID</Text>
              )}

              <Button title="Authenticate" onPress={authenticate} />
            </>
          ) : (
            <Text>No Biometrics Enrolled</Text>
          )}
        </>
      ) : (
        <Text>No Hardware Available</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `expo-local-authentication`:** Imports the necessary module.
2.  **`hasHardwareAsync()`:** Checks if the device has the necessary hardware for local authentication.
3.  **`isEnrolledAsync()`:** Determines if the user has enrolled biometrics (fingerprint or Face ID) or has a passcode/PIN set up.
4.  **`supportedAuthenticationTypesAsync()`:** Returns an array of the supported authentication types. This can be useful to display the appropriate icon/message to the user (e.g., "Authenticate with Face ID" or "Authenticate with Fingerprint"). We check if any are supported and then log which are supported to state.
5.  **`authenticateAsync()`:** Prompts the user for authentication using the available methods (biometrics or passcode).
    - `promptMessage`: The message displayed to the user on iOS when prompting for authentication.
    - `fallbackLabel`: The label for the button to use the device passcode on iOS. If null, passcode won't be offered.
    - `cancelLabel`: The label for the cancel button on Android.
6.  **Result Handling:** The `authenticateAsync()` function returns a promise that resolves with a result object containing:
    - `success`: A boolean indicating whether authentication was successful.
    - `error`: An error code string if authentication failed. Refer to the Expo documentation for a list of possible error codes.

## Advanced Usage and Best Practices

### Handling Authentication Failures

It's important to handle authentication failures gracefully. The `authenticateAsync()` function can return various error codes, such as:

- `user_cancel`: The user canceled the authentication process.
- `authentication_failed`: Authentication failed due to incorrect biometrics or passcode.
- `passcode_not_set`: The user hasn't set up a passcode on their device.
- `not_available`: Local authentication is not available on the device.

You can use a `switch` statement to handle these error codes and provide appropriate feedback to the user:

```plaintext
const authenticate = async () => {
  const result = await LocalAuthentication.authenticateAsync({
    promptMessage: 'Authenticate to access the app',
    fallbackLabel: 'Use Passcode',
    cancelLabel: 'Cancel',
  })

  if (result.success) {
    Alert.alert('Authentication Successful', 'You are now authenticated!')
  } else {
    switch (result.error) {
      case 'user_cancel':
        Alert.alert('Authentication Canceled', 'You canceled the authentication process.')
        break
      case 'authentication_failed':
        Alert.alert('Authentication Failed', 'Incorrect biometrics or passcode.')
        break
      case 'passcode_not_set':
        Alert.alert('Passcode Not Set', 'Please set up a passcode on your device.')
        break
      case 'not_available':
        Alert.alert(
          'Authentication Not Available',
          'Local authentication is not available on this device.'
        )
        break
      default:
        Alert.alert('Authentication Error', `An unknown error occurred: ${result.error}`)
        break
    }
  }
}
```

### Storing Authentication State

You'll typically want to store the authentication state (whether the user is logged in or not) in your app. You can use a state management library like Redux, Zustand, or React Context to manage this state. Alternatively, for simple cases, `AsyncStorage` can be used for persistence across app restarts.

```plaintext
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage'

const AUTH_STATE_KEY = 'authState'

const saveAuthState = async (isAuthenticated) => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(AUTH_STATE_KEY, isAuthenticated.toString())
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving auth state:', error)
  }
}

const loadAuthState = async () => {
  try {
    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem(AUTH_STATE_KEY)
    if (value !== null) {
      return value === 'true'
    }
    return false // Default to not authenticated
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading auth state:', error)
    return false
  }
}
```

Remember to install `AsyncStorage`:

```plaintext
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

### Handling Device Changes

Users may change their device's biometric settings (e.g., add or remove a fingerprint). You should listen for changes to these settings and update your app's authentication state accordingly. Unfortunately, `expo-local-authentication` does not provide a direct event listener for this. The best approach is to re-check `isEnrolledAsync()` and potentially `hasHardwareAsync()` on app focus/resume (using `AppState` from React Native) and refresh the UI.

### Using with Expo Router

If you're using Expo Router for navigation, you can easily protect specific routes by requiring local authentication before allowing the user to access them. Create a higher-order component (HOC) that checks the authentication state and redirects the user to the login screen if they are not authenticated.

```plaintext
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router'
import * as LocalAuthentication from 'expo-local-authentication'
import { View, Text, ActivityIndicator } from 'react-native'

const withAuthentication = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false)
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
    const router = useRouter()

    useEffect(() => {
      const checkAuthentication = async () => {
        const isEnrolled = await LocalAuthentication.isEnrolledAsync()
        if (!isEnrolled) {
          router.replace('/login') // Redirect to login page
        } else {
          //Attempt authentication immediately
          const result = await LocalAuthentication.authenticateAsync({
            promptMessage: 'Authenticate to access the app',
            fallbackLabel: 'Use Passcode',
            cancelLabel: 'Cancel',
          })

          if (result.success) {
            setIsAuthenticated(true)
          } else {
            router.replace('/login')
          }
        }
        setIsLoading(false)
      }

      checkAuthentication()
    }, [])

    if (isLoading) {
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
          <ActivityIndicator size="large" />
          <Text>Authenticating...</Text>
        </View>
      )
    }

    return isAuthenticated ? <WrappedComponent {...props} /> : null // Or a redirect
  }
}

export default withAuthentication
```

Then, wrap your protected routes with this HOC:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import withAuthentication from './withAuthentication'

const ProtectedScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is a protected screen!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default withAuthentication(ProtectedScreen)
```

### Customizing the Authentication Prompt

On iOS, you can customize the appearance of the authentication prompt using the `promptMessage` and `fallbackLabel` options in the `authenticateAsync()` function. On Android, the appearance is mostly determined by the device's system settings. However, you can use the `cancelLabel` option to customize the text of the cancel button.

## Security Considerations

- **Local Authentication is Not a Substitute for Server-Side Authentication:** Local authentication only verifies the user's identity on the device. You should still implement server-side authentication to protect your app's data and resources.
- **Secure Storage:** Sensitive data should be stored securely using encryption. Consider using libraries like `expo-secure-store` for storing API keys, tokens, and other sensitive information.
- **Rooting/Jailbreaking:** Rooted or jailbroken devices can compromise the security of local authentication. Implement checks to detect rooted/jailbroken devices and take appropriate action. Libraries like `react-native-device-info` can assist with this.
- **Biometric Data Security:** The biometric data itself is never exposed to your application. The local authentication API only provides a success/failure indication. The device's operating system handles the biometric data securely.

## Conclusion

`expo-local-authentication` provides a convenient and secure way to implement device-level authentication in your React Native applications. By leveraging biometrics and device credentials, you can enhance the security of your app and provide a seamless user experience. Remember to follow best practices and consider the security implications to ensure that your app is well-protected. This guide provides a solid foundation for implementing local authentication in your Expo projects. Happy coding!
