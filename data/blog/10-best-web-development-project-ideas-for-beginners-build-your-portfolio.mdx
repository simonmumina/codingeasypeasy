    <title>To-Do List</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>To-Do List</h1>

        <button id="addButton">Add</button>
        <ul id="taskList"></ul>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Example (script.js):**

```javascript
const taskInput = document.getElementById("taskInput");
const addButton = document.getElementById("addButton");
const taskList = document.getElementById("taskList");

addButton.addEventListener("click", addTask);

function addTask() {
  const taskText = taskInput.value.trim();
  if (taskText !== "") {
    const listItem = document.createElement("li");
    listItem.textContent = taskText;
    taskList.appendChild(listItem);
    taskInput.value = "";

    listItem.addEventListener("click", function() {
      listItem.classList.toggle("completed");
    });

    listItem.addEventListener("dblclick", function() {
      listItem.remove();
    });
  }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:** JavaScript DOM manipulation (creating elements, appending them, adding event listeners), event handling (click events).

### 3.  Simple Calculator

**Description:** Build a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Why it's great for beginners:** Reinforces JavaScript event handling and basic arithmetic operations.

**Key Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Key Takeaways:** Event listeners on calculator buttons, string parsing, using the `eval()` function (with caution and sanitization!), displaying results.

### 4.  Quote Generator

**Description:**  Display a random quote from an array of quotes or an external API.

**Why it's great for beginners:** Introduces working with arrays (if using a local array) or fetching data from an API (if using an external source).

**Key Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially `fetch` API)

```javascript
const quotes = [
    "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs",
    "Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value. - Albert Einstein",
    "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. - Albert Einstein"
];

const quoteDisplay = document.getElementById("quoteDisplay");
const generateButton = document.getElementById("generateButton");

generateButton.addEventListener("click", generateQuote);

function generateQuote() {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
    quoteDisplay.textContent = quotes[randomIndex];
}
```

**Key Takeaways:** Array manipulation, random number generation, updating the DOM with dynamic content.  If using an API, learn about `fetch` and handling JSON data.

##  Tips for Success

*   **Start Small:**  Don't try to build the next Facebook on your first project. Focus on mastering the basics first.
*   **Break Down the Project:**  Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
*   **Use Online Resources:**  Don't be afraid to Google!  Stack Overflow and MDN Web Docs are your best friends.
*   **Version Control (Git):**  Use Git to track your changes and collaborate with others.  GitHub is a popular platform for hosting Git repositories.
*   **Test Regularly:**  Test your code frequently to catch errors early.
*   **Ask for Help:**  If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help from online communities or mentors.
*   **Document Your Code:**  Write comments to explain your code and make it easier to understand.
*   **Deploy Your Projects:**  Show off your work!  Deploy your projects to platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
*   **Refactor:**  Once your project is working, go back and refactor your code to improve its readability and maintainability.
*   **Be Patient:**  Learning web development takes time and effort.  Don't get discouraged if you encounter challenges. Keep practicing and you'll eventually get there.
