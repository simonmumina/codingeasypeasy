# Yarn Stage Explained: Optimize Your JavaScript Project Build Process

Yarn Stage is a powerful (yet often overlooked) feature of the Yarn package manager that allows you to optimize your JavaScript project's build process, reduce deployment size, and improve overall performance.  It achieves this by intelligently staging your project's dependencies, ensuring only the necessary packages are included in your final build. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing Yarn Stage effectively.

## What is Yarn Stage?

Yarn Stage provides a mechanism to create a staging directory containing only the dependencies required for a specific environment or task. Think of it as a carefully curated subset of your `node_modules` folder, designed to be as lean and efficient as possible. This is particularly useful for:

*   **Reducing deployment size:**  By excluding unnecessary dependencies, you can significantly shrink your application's footprint, leading to faster deployments and reduced server costs.
*   **Improving build times:**  With fewer files to process, build tools like Webpack or Parcel can operate much more quickly.
*   **Optimizing for different environments:**  You can create separate stages for development, testing, and production, each with its own set of dependencies.
*   **Isolating dependencies:** Yarn Stage can help isolate dependencies, preventing conflicts between development and production environments.

## Why Use Yarn Stage Over `npm prune --production` or similar?

While `npm prune --production` and similar tools offer some level of dependency pruning, Yarn Stage offers more granular control and features that make it superior in many scenarios:

*   **Specificity:**  Yarn Stage allows you to define precise rules for which dependencies to include or exclude, going beyond simple `devDependencies` management.
*   **Customizable scripts:** You can define custom scripts that execute within the staged environment.
*   **Reproducible builds:** Yarn Stage configurations are explicitly defined, ensuring consistent builds across different environments.
*   **Integration with other tools:**  It integrates seamlessly with other Yarn features and workflows.

## Getting Started with Yarn Stage

Before diving into advanced configurations, let's start with the basics.

1.  **Install Yarn (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
    ```

2.  **Initialize your project (if you haven't already):**

    ```bash
    npm init -y  # Or yarn init -y
    ```

3.  **Install your dependencies:**

    ```bash
    yarn add lodash react react-dom # Add some dependencies
    yarn add --dev jest eslint prettier # Add some devDependencies
    ```

## Basic Usage: Creating a Simple Stage

The simplest way to use Yarn Stage is to create a `.yarnstage` file in your project root.  This file defines the staging configuration.  Let's start with a basic example that includes all production dependencies.

```
# .yarnstage
include:
  - "**" # Include everything in node_modules
exclude:
  - "**/@types/**" # Exclude TypeScript definition files
  - "**/test/**" # Exclude test directories
```

This configuration includes all files and directories under `node_modules` except for directories named `@types` or `test`.

To stage your project, run the following command:

```bash
yarn stage
```

This will create a `.yarnstage` directory at the root of your project. This directory will contain a staged version of your `node_modules` folder, adhering to the rules defined in your `.yarnstage` file.  The original `node_modules` directory is untouched.

## The `.yarnstage` File: Configuration Options

The `.yarnstage` file uses a simple YAML-like syntax to define the staging rules. The key options are:

*   **`include`:** A list of glob patterns that specify which files and directories to include in the stage. If not present, defaults to including all.
*   **`exclude`:** A list of glob patterns that specify which files and directories to exclude from the stage.  Takes precedence over `include`.
*   **`entry`:** A file which is executed within the staging environment with `node`. This is useful for running tasks within the context of your staged dependencies.
*   **`ignore`:** A list of glob patterns for files that should not be copied. It behaves like `.gitignore`
*   **`cache`:** Configuration for yarn cache within the stage
*   **`copy`:** Define files or directories to copy into the staged output folder

**Example: Excluding Development Dependencies**

A common use case is to exclude development dependencies from your production build. Here's how you can achieve that:

```
# .yarnstage
exclude:
  - "**/jest/**"
  - "**/eslint/**"
  - "**/prettier/**"
  - "**/@types/**"
  - "**/node_modules/@types/**"
  - "**/webpack/**"
  - "**/babel/**"
  - "**/typescript/**"
```

This configuration excludes directories related to testing, linting, formatting, TypeScript typings, Webpack, Babel, and TypeScript compilers.  This is a more comprehensive exclusion than just excluding `@types`.

**Example: Including Specific Dependencies Only**

Sometimes you might only want to include a specific set of dependencies. Here's how you can do that:

```
# .yarnstage
include:
  - "**/lodash/**"
  - "**/react/**"
  - "**/react-dom/**"
```

This configuration only includes files and directories related to `lodash`, `react`, and `react-dom`.  All other dependencies will be excluded.  Use this with caution, as it's easy to forget dependencies needed transitively.

**Example:  Using `entry` to Run a Task Within the Staged Environment**

```
# .yarnstage
include:
  - "**"
entry: ./scripts/post-stage.js
```

Now create the `scripts/post-stage.js` file:

```javascript
// scripts/post-stage.js
console.log("Running post-stage script within the staged environment!");
// You can perform tasks like code generation or database migrations here.
```

After running `yarn stage`, the script defined in `entry` will be executed within the `.yarnstage` directory.  This allows you to perform tasks that rely on the staged dependencies.  Ensure the script file has executable permissions.

## Advanced Configuration and Usage

Yarn Stage offers more advanced features to fine-tune your build process.

### Staging with Environment Variables

You can use environment variables within your `.yarnstage` file to dynamically configure the staging process.

```
# .yarnstage
include:
  - "**"
exclude:
  - "**/@types/**"
  - "**/test/**"
  - ${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '"**/dev-dependency/**"' : '""'}
```

In this example, the `dev-dependency` directory will only be excluded when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`. Note the usage of `${}` for environment variable interpolation and the need for escaping the double quotes.  Remember to set your environment variables before running `yarn stage`.

### Integrating with Build Tools (Webpack, Parcel, etc.)

The most common use case for Yarn Stage is to integrate it with your build tools. After staging your dependencies, you can configure your build tool to use the `.yarnstage` directory as the `node_modules` path.

**Webpack Example:**

In your `webpack.config.js`, you can modify the `resolve.modules` configuration:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations
  resolve: {
    modules: [
      path.resolve(__dirname, '.yarnstage/node_modules'), // Use the staged node_modules
      'node_modules' // Fallback to the original node_modules (optional)
    ],
  },
};
```

This configuration tells Webpack to first look for modules within the `.yarnstage/node_modules` directory. If a module is not found there, it will fall back to the original `node_modules` directory (which is optional and can be removed for production builds).  Be sure to run `yarn stage` *before* running your Webpack build.

**Important:** When integrating with build tools, ensure your `.yarnstage` configuration accurately reflects the dependencies required by your build. Missing dependencies will lead to build errors.

### Optimizing for Production Deployments

For production deployments, you want to ensure the smallest possible bundle size. This typically involves:

1.  **Excluding all development dependencies:**  Use a comprehensive `exclude` list in your `.yarnstage` file.
2.  **Minifying and compressing your code:**  Use build tools like Webpack or Parcel to minify and compress your code.
3.  **Tree shaking:**  Enable tree shaking in your build tool to remove unused code.
4.  **Code splitting:**  Split your code into smaller chunks to improve loading times.

### Considerations and Best Practices

*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent `.yarnstage` configuration across your development, testing, and production environments.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Properly manage your dependencies using `yarn add` and `yarn remove` to ensure your `package.json` accurately reflects your project's requirements.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your application after staging to ensure everything works as expected.
*   **Version Control:**  Commit your `.yarnstage` file to your version control system to ensure reproducibility. The `.yarnstage` *directory* itself should typically be added to your `.gitignore` file, since its contents are generated.
*   **Cache Busting:** Consider cache busting strategies to ensure users always receive the latest version of your application.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Integrate Yarn Stage into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the staging and deployment process.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Module not found" errors:**  This usually indicates that a required dependency is missing from your `.yarnstage` configuration. Review your `include` and `exclude` lists and add the missing dependency.
*   **Unexpected behavior:**  Ensure your `.yarnstage` configuration is correct and that you have run `yarn stage` before building your application.
*   **Slow build times:**  Optimize your `.yarnstage` configuration to exclude unnecessary files and directories.

## Conclusion

Yarn Stage is a valuable tool for optimizing your JavaScript project's build process, reducing deployment size, and improving performance.
