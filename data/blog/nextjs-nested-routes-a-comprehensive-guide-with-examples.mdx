# Next.js Nested Routes: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Next.js offers a powerful and intuitive way to manage routing in your web applications using its file-based routing system. This system simplifies navigation and organization, especially when dealing with complex applications that require nested structures. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore Next.js nested routes, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques with clear code examples.

## What are Nested Routes in Next.js?

Nested routes in Next.js allow you to create hierarchical URL structures that mirror your application's organization. Instead of having all your pages in a single `pages` directory, you can create subdirectories to reflect the relationship between different parts of your application. This leads to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

Next.js uses the structure of your `app` directory (or `pages` if you are on an older version) to determine the routes. For example, if you have a directory structure like this:

```
app/
  blog/
    posts/
      [id]/
        page.tsx
    page.tsx
  page.tsx
```

This translates to the following routes:

*   `/` (defined by `app/page.tsx`)
*   `/blog` (defined by `app/blog/page.tsx`)
*   `/blog/posts/[id]` (defined by `app/blog/posts/[id]/page.tsx`)

The `[id]` part is a dynamic route segment, allowing you to create pages that display different content based on the URL parameter. We'll delve into dynamic routes later in this guide.

## Basic Nested Routes

Let's start with a simple example. Suppose you're building a blog and want to create a dedicated section for articles.

1.  **Create the `app/blog` directory:**

    Inside your Next.js project, create a folder named `blog` within the `app` directory.

2.  **Create the `app/blog/page.tsx` file:**

    Inside the `blog` folder, create a file named `page.tsx` (or `.jsx`). This file will handle the `/blog` route.

    ```tsx
    // app/blog/page.tsx
    import Link from 'next/link';

    export default function BlogIndex() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Blog</h1>
          <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link href="/blog/posts/first-post">
                <a>First Post</a>
              </Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link href="/blog/posts/second-post">
                <a>Second Post</a>
              </Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

3.  **Create the `app/page.tsx` file:**

    If you don't already have one, make sure you have a home page at `app/page.tsx`:

    ```tsx
    // app/page.tsx
    import Link from 'next/link';

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome!</h1>
          <p>This is the homepage.</p>
          <Link href="/blog">
            <a>Visit the Blog</a>
          </Link>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

Now, when you navigate to `/blog`, you'll see the content of `app/blog/page.tsx`.

## Creating Deeper Nested Routes

You can create routes with multiple levels of nesting. For example, let's create a route for individual blog posts.

1.  **Create the `app/blog/posts` directory:**

    Inside the `app/blog` directory, create a folder named `posts`.

2.  **Create the `app/blog/posts/page.tsx` file:**

    Inside the `posts` folder, create a `page.tsx` file to render a list of blog posts:

    ```tsx
    // app/blog/posts/page.tsx
    import Link from 'next/link';

    export default function PostsIndex() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Blog Posts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link href="/blog/posts/first-post">
                <a>First Post</a>
              </Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link href="/blog/posts/second-post">
                <a>Second Post</a>
              </Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

   Now you can visit `/blog/posts` and see the list of posts.

## Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes allow you to create pages with URLs that contain parameters. This is essential for situations where you want to display content based on a specific identifier, such as a blog post ID or a product SKU.

1.  **Create the `app/blog/posts/[id]` directory:**

    Inside the `app/blog/posts` directory, create a folder named `[id]`.  The square brackets `[]` indicate that `id` is a dynamic segment.

2.  **Create the `app/blog/posts/[id]/page.tsx` file:**

    Inside the `[id]` folder, create a `page.tsx` file. This file will handle the `/blog/posts/:id` route.

    ```tsx
    // app/blog/posts/[id]/page.tsx
    import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

    export default function BlogPost() {
      const router = useRouter();
      const { id } = router.query;

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Blog Post: {id}</h1>
          <p>This is the content for blog post with ID: {id}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    In this example, we use the `useRouter` hook from `next/router` to access the `id` parameter from the URL. When you visit `/blog/posts/first-post`, the page will display "Blog Post: first-post".  Note that with the `app` router the way to access dynamic route parameters has changed.  The correct example is below:

     ```tsx
    // app/blog/posts/[id]/page.tsx
    interface Props {
        params: { id: string }
    }

    export default function BlogPost({ params }: Props) {
        const { id } = params;

        return (
          <div>
            <h1>Blog Post: {id}</h1>
            <p>This is the content for blog post with ID: {id}</p>
          </div>
        );
      }
    ```

Now, when you navigate to `/blog/posts/first-post` or `/blog/posts/second-post`, you'll see the corresponding post content.

## Generating Static Paths for Dynamic Routes

If you want to pre-render dynamic routes at build time (Static Site Generation or SSG), you can use `generateStaticParams` (for the app router) or `getStaticPaths` (for the pages router).  This is important for SEO and performance.  Let's create an example for the app router

In the  `app/blog/posts/[id]/page.tsx` file, you would use the following:

```tsx
// app/blog/posts/[id]/page.tsx
interface Props {
    params: { id: string }
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
    return [
      { id: 'first-post' },
      { id: 'second-post' },
    ]
  }

export default function BlogPost({ params }: Props) {
    const { id } = params;

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Blog Post: {id}</h1>
        <p>This is the content for blog post with ID: {id}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

In this example `generateStaticParams` returns an array of objects. Each object defines the possible `id` values for your dynamic route. During the build process, Next.js will generate HTML pages for `/blog/posts/first-post` and `/blog/posts/second-post`.

## Route Groups

Route groups (introduced in Next.js 13) allow you to organize your route segments without affecting the URL structure. This can be useful for complex layouts and modularizing your application.

To create a route group, wrap the directory name with parentheses: `(group-name)`.  This directory will not be included in the route's URL path.

For example, if you have the following directory structure:

```
app/
  (marketing)/
    about/
      page.tsx
    contact/
      page.tsx
  (shop)/
    products/
      page.tsx
  page.tsx
```

The accessible routes will be:

*   `/`
*   `/about`
*   `/contact`
*   `/products`

The `(marketing)` and `(shop)` directories are used for organizational purposes but don't appear in the URL.

**Example:** Let's say you want to group your blog and shop related pages.

1.  **Create route groups:** Create `(blog)` and `(shop)` directories within your `app` directory.

2.  **Move files into the groups:** Move the `blog` directory and create a `shop` directory with relevant files into the groups.

Now, your structure will look like this:

```
app/
  (blog)/
    blog/
      posts/
        [id]/
          page.tsx
      page.tsx
  (shop)/
    products/
      page.tsx
  page.tsx
```

The URLs will remain unchanged: `/`, `/blog`, `/blog/posts/[id]`, and `/products`.  You have only reorganized the directory structure for clarity and maintainability.

## Best Practices for Nested Routes in Next.js

*   **Maintain a Consistent Directory Structure:**  Keep your directory structure aligned with your application's logical structure for easy navigation and understanding.
*   **Use Route Groups for Organization:** Leverage route groups to break down your application into manageable modules without impacting URLs.
*   **Handle Dynamic Routes Carefully:** Ensure you validate and sanitize parameters passed through dynamic routes to prevent security vulnerabilities. Use `generateStaticParams` or `getStaticPaths` where possible for pre-rendering.
*   **Leverage Layouts:** Use Layouts in your `app` directory to share UI components across different routes to avoid code duplication.
