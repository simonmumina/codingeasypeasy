# How to Set Up Your Own Git Server: A Comprehensive Guide

Version control is crucial for any software development project. While services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are widely used, setting up your own Git server offers greater control, privacy, and potentially lower costs, especially for large teams or sensitive projects. This guide walks you through several methods for setting up a Git server, from basic bare repositories to more feature-rich solutions like Gitea.

## Why Set Up Your Own Git Server?

Before we dive into the how-to, let's explore the reasons why you might choose to host your own Git server:

- **Control:** You have complete control over your data, access permissions, and server configurations.
- **Privacy:** Ideal for projects with strict confidentiality requirements. No third party has access to your codebase.
- **Cost Savings:** Over time, hosting your own server can be more cost-effective than paying for large team plans on hosted platforms.
- **Customization:** You can tailor the server environment to your specific needs and integrate it with existing infrastructure.
- **Learning Experience:** Setting up and maintaining a Git server provides valuable DevOps skills.
- **Offline Access:** If you configure it correctly, you can access your repositories even without internet connectivity.
- **Local Network Speed:** If you and your team are on the same local network, pushing and pulling commits can be significantly faster.

## Option 1: Basic Bare Repository with SSH Access

This is the simplest method, suitable for small teams comfortable with the command line. It involves creating a "bare" repository (one without a working directory) and granting access via SSH.

**Prerequisites:**

- A Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).
- SSH access to the server.
- Git installed on both the server and client machines.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a Git User (Recommended for Security):**

    On your server, create a dedicated user for Git:

    ```plaintext
    sudo adduser git
    sudo passwd git  # Set a strong password
    ```

2.  **Create a Bare Repository:**

    Log in to the server as the `git` user:

    ```plaintext
    sudo su - git
    ```

    Create a directory to store your repositories (if it doesn't exist already):

    ```plaintext
    mkdir /home/git/repositories
    cd /home/git/repositories
    ```

    Create the bare repository:

    ```plaintext
    git init --bare myproject.git
    chown -R git:git myproject.git  # Ensure proper ownership
    chmod -R 755 myproject.git     # Set appropriate permissions
    ```

    Replace `myproject` with the desired name for your project. The `.git` extension is a convention for bare repositories.

3.  **Client-Side Configuration:**

    On your local machine (where you want to push code from), initialize a new Git repository (if you don't already have one):

    ```plaintext
    git init mylocalproject
    cd mylocalproject
    echo "Initial commit" > README.md
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

    Add the remote to your local repository, replacing `<server_ip>` with the IP address or hostname of your server:

    ```plaintext
    git remote add origin git@<server_ip>:/home/git/repositories/myproject.git
    ```

4.  **Push Your Code:**

    Now you can push your code to the server:

    ```plaintext
    git push -u origin main # or git push -u origin master, depending on your default branch
    ```

5.  **SSH Key Authentication (Recommended for Security):**

    Password-based SSH authentication can be less secure. It's highly recommended to use SSH key authentication:

    - **Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine:**

      ```plaintext
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
      ```

      Accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

    - **Copy the public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the `git` user:**

      You can use `ssh-copy-id`:

      ```plaintext
      ssh-copy-id git@<server_ip>
      ```

      Or manually copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` and append them to `/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server (while logged in as the `git` user). If the `.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file don't exist, create them with the correct permissions:

      ```plaintext
      mkdir -p /home/git/.ssh
      chmod 700 /home/git/.ssh
      touch /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys
      chmod 600 /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys
      ```

    - **Disable Password Authentication (Highly Recommended):**

      Edit the SSH server configuration file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on most Linux distributions):

      ```plaintext
      sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      ```

      Find the line `PasswordAuthentication yes` and change it to `PasswordAuthentication no`.

      Also, make sure `PubkeyAuthentication` is set to `yes`.

      Restart the SSH service:

      ```plaintext
      sudo systemctl restart sshd
      ```

**Important Considerations for Basic Setup:**

- **Security:** This basic setup lacks many security features found in more sophisticated Git server solutions. Implement SSH key authentication, regularly update your server, and use a strong password for the `git` user (even if you disable password authentication, it may still be used in some cases).
- **Collaboration:** Managing user access and permissions can be cumbersome with this method. Each developer will need SSH access to the `git` user.
- **Web Interface:** There is no web interface for browsing repositories or managing issues.

## Option 2: Using Gitea

Gitea is a lightweight, self-hosted Git service written in Go. It provides a user-friendly web interface and many features similar to GitHub and GitLab, including:

- Web-based repository browsing
- User management
- Issue tracking
- Pull requests
- Wikis
- Project management

**Prerequisites:**

- A Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS) with SSH access.
- Git installed on the server.
- A database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite). SQLite is the easiest to set up for small teams.
- A web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) is recommended but not strictly required if you just want to access Gitea via its built-in server.

**Steps:**

1.  **Download and Install Gitea:**

    Download the appropriate binary for your system from the [Gitea releases page](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/releases).

    For example, on a Linux server (x86_64):

    ```plaintext
    wget https://dl.gitea.io/gitea/1.21.5/gitea-1.21.5-linux-amd64
    mv gitea-1.21.5-linux-amd64 gitea
    chmod +x gitea
    sudo mv gitea /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    (Replace `1.21.5` with the latest version number.)

2.  **Create a Gitea User:**

    Create a dedicated user for Gitea:

    ```plaintext
    sudo adduser --system --shell /bin/bash --group git gitea
    ```

3.  **Create the Necessary Directories:**

    Create directories for Gitea to store its data:

    ```plaintext
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/gitea/{custom,data,log}
    sudo chown -R gitea:git /var/lib/gitea/
    sudo chmod -R 770 /var/lib/gitea/
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/gitea
    sudo chown root:git /etc/gitea
    sudo chmod 770 /etc/gitea
    ```

4.  **Configure Gitea (Recommended to start the service manually once, then configure via web):**

    **Create a `gitea.ini` configuration file in `/etc/gitea`. A minimal example is:**

    ```plaintext
    [database]
    DB_TYPE  = sqlite3
    PATH     = /var/lib/gitea/data/gitea.db

    [repository]
    ROOT = /var/lib/gitea/data/repositories

    [server]
    DOMAIN           = yourdomain.com  # Replace with your domain or IP address
    HTTP_PORT        = 3000
    ROOT_URL         = http://yourdomain.com:3000/  # Replace with your URL
    DISABLE_SSH      = false
    SSH_DOMAIN       = yourdomain.com
    SSH_PORT         = 22 # if you changed the default SSH port to something other than 22, change this accordingly

    [mailer]
    ENABLED = false

    [service]
    REGISTER_EMAIL_CONFIRM = false
    ENABLE_NOTIFY_MAIL     = false
    DISABLE_REGISTRATION   = false
    ENABLE_CAPTCHA         = false
    ```

    **Explanation of Key Configuration Options:**

    - `DB_TYPE`: Specifies the database type (sqlite3, mysql, postgres).
    - `PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file. For MySQL or PostgreSQL, you'll need to provide connection details.
    - `ROOT`: Directory where Git repositories will be stored.
    - `DOMAIN`: Domain name or IP address of your server.
    - `HTTP_PORT`: Port Gitea will listen on.
    - `ROOT_URL`: The base URL for your Gitea instance. This is crucial for proper routing.
    - `DISABLE_SSH`: Whether to disable SSH support (defaults to `false`).
    - `SSH_DOMAIN`: Domain or IP for SSH access.
    - `SSH_PORT`: SSH Port.

    **Secure Gitea**:

    - **Create a systemd Service File (Recommended):** This allows you to easily start, stop, and manage Gitea as a service.
      Create a file `/etc/systemd/system/gitea.service` with the following content:

      ```plaintext
      [Unit]
      Description=Gitea (Git with a cup of tea)
      After=syslog.target
      After=network.target
      After=mariadb.service
      After=mysqld.service
      After=postgresql.service

      [Service]
      RestartSec=2s
      Type=simple
      User=gitea
      Group=git
      WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/gitea/
      ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gitea web -c /etc/gitea/gitea.ini
      Restart=always
      Environment=USER=gitea HOME=/home/gitea GITEA_WORK_DIR=/var/lib/gitea

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```

      Enable and start the service:

      ```plaintext
      sudo systemctl enable gitea
      sudo systemctl start gitea
      sudo systemctl status gitea  # Verify it's running correctly
      ```

5.  **Web Interface Setup:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://yourdomain.com:3000/` (or the IP address and port you configured). You'll be presented with a setup wizard.

    - **Database Settings:** Fill in the database connection details (SQLite path, MySQL/PostgreSQL credentials).
    - **General Settings:** Set the application title, repository root path, and other options.
    - **Administrator Account:** Create the initial administrator account.

6.  **Configure Nginx/Apache (Recommended for Production):**

    For better performance and security, it's recommended to use a web server like Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy for Gitea. This allows you to use HTTPS and serve Gitea on port 80/443.

    **Nginx Example:**

    Create a new Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/gitea`):

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com;  # Replace with your domain

        access_log /var/log/nginx/gitea.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/gitea.error.log;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Forward requests to Gitea
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```

    Create a symbolic link to enable the site:

    ```plaintext
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/gitea /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```

    Test the Nginx configuration and restart the service:

    ```plaintext
    sudo nginx -t
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

    **Enable HTTPS (Highly Recommended):** Use Let's Encrypt to obtain a free SSL certificate:

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
    ```

    Certbot will automatically configure Nginx to use HTTPS.

**Important Considerations for Gitea:**

- **Security:** Regularly update Gitea to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities. Enable HTTPS and use strong passwords. Consider using two-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Backups:** Regularly back up your Gitea database and repository data to prevent data loss.
- **Resource Usage:** Gitea is relatively lightweight, but monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) as your usage grows.

## Other Git Server Options

Besides bare repositories and Gitea, here are some other options for setting up a Git server:

- **GitLab:** A more comprehensive DevOps platform with a wide range of features. It's more resource-intensive than Gitea but offers more advanced capabilities. GitLab Community Edition (CE) is free and open-source.
- **Gogs:** Another lightweight Git server written in Go, similar to Gitea. It's less actively maintained than Gitea.
- **cgit:** A fast and lightweight web interface for Git repositories. It doesn't include user management or issue tracking, but it's a good option if you just need a simple way to browse your repositories.
- **RhodeCode:** An open-source platform for code management, including Git, Mercurial, and Subversion support.
- **Forgejo:** A fork of Gitea focused on community governance and a more privacy-respecting approach.

## Conclusion

Setting up your own Git server provides you with greater control, privacy, and potentially cost savings. The best method for you will depend on your specific needs, technical expertise, and the size of your team. Start with the simplest option (bare repositories with SSH access) and consider upgrading to Gitea or GitLab as your requirements evolve. Remember to prioritize security and regularly back up your data. Good luck!
