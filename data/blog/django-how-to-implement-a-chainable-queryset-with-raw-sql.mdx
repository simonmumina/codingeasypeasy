# Django: How to Implement a Chainable QuerySet with Raw SQL

Django's QuerySets are a powerful tool for interacting with your database, providing an ORM layer that abstracts away the complexities of SQL. However, there are times when you might need the flexibility of raw SQL to optimize performance or leverage specific database features not easily accessible through the ORM. This post explores how to implement a custom Django QuerySet that executes raw SQL queries, while still retaining the valuable chaining capabilities of standard Django QuerySets. This allows you to combine the power of SQL with the convenience of the Django ORM.

## Why Use Raw SQL in Django?

While Django's ORM is generally sufficient, there are several scenarios where raw SQL offers advantages:

- **Performance Optimization:** Raw SQL can be significantly faster for complex queries, especially those involving joins, aggregations, or database-specific optimizations. The ORM might not always generate the most efficient SQL.
- **Access to Database-Specific Features:** You might need to use features unique to your database system (e.g., window functions in PostgreSQL, specific full-text search capabilities). The ORM might not expose these features directly.
- **Legacy Databases:** When working with existing databases, you might already have complex SQL queries that you want to reuse.
- **Complex Aggregations and Data Transformations:** Performing advanced data transformations directly in the database can be more efficient than pulling data into Python and processing it.

## The Challenge: Maintaining Chainability

The key challenge is to create a raw SQL QuerySet that can be chained with other QuerySet methods like `filter()`, `exclude()`, `order_by()`, and `annotate()`. We need to ensure that each operation returns a new QuerySet object, allowing for a fluent and intuitive way to build queries.

## Building a Custom QuerySet with Raw SQL

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a chainable QuerySet that uses raw SQL:

### 1. Create a Custom Manager

First, create a custom model manager. The manager will provide the entry point for our custom QuerySet.

```plaintext
from django.db import models
from django.db import connection


class RawSQLQuerySet(models.QuerySet):
    def __init__(self, model=None, query=None, params=None, using=None, hints=None):
        super().__init__(model=model, query=query, using=using, hints=hints)
        self.raw_query = query  # Store the raw SQL query
        self.raw_params = params or []  # Store the parameters for the query
        self.raw_using = using

    def raw(self, query, params=None, using=None):
        """
        Creates a new RawSQLQuerySet with the given raw SQL query.
        """
        return RawSQLQuerySet(model=self.model, query=query, params=params, using=using or self.db)


    def filter(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Override filter to prevent ORM filtering on a raw QuerySet
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("Cannot use filter() on a RawSQLQuerySet.  Use the raw() method to specify your SQL query with filtering directly.")

    def exclude(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Override exclude to prevent ORM filtering on a raw QuerySet
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("Cannot use exclude() on a RawSQLQuerySet.  Use the raw() method to specify your SQL query with filtering directly.")

    def order_by(self, *args):
         """
        Override order_by to prevent ORM ordering on a raw QuerySet
        """
         raise NotImplementedError("Cannot use order_by() on a RawSQLQuerySet.  Use the raw() method to specify your SQL query with ordering directly.")

    def annotate(self, *args, **kwargs):
         """
        Override annotate to prevent ORM annotation on a raw QuerySet
        """
         raise NotImplementedError("Cannot use annotate() on a RawSQLQuerySet.  Use the raw() method to specify your SQL query with annotation directly.")

    def all(self):
        """
        Executes the raw SQL query and returns a list of model instances.
        """
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(self.raw_query, self.raw_params)
            columns = [col[0] for col in cursor.description]
            results = []
            for row in cursor.fetchall():
                data = dict(zip(columns, row))
                instance = self.model(**data) # Use the model's constructor for instantiation
                results.append(instance)
            return results

    def __len__(self):
        """
        Returns the number of results from the raw SQL query.
        """
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ({self.raw_query}) as subquery", self.raw_params)  # Wrap in subquery for count
            return cursor.fetchone()[0]

    def __iter__(self):
        """
        Iterates over the results of the raw SQL query.
        """
        return iter(self.all())

    def __getitem__(self, item):
        """
        Allows slicing and indexing of the raw SQL query results.
        """
        results = self.all()  # Execute the query once and cache the results
        return results[item]


class RawSQLManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return RawSQLQuerySet(model=self.model)

    def raw(self, query, params=None, using=None):
        """
        Entry point for executing raw SQL queries.
        """
        return self.get_queryset().raw(query, params, using)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`RawSQLQuerySet`**: This class inherits from `models.QuerySet` and overrides its `__init__` and `raw` methods.

  - `__init__`: The constructor now accepts `query` and `params` to store the raw SQL query and its parameters. It's crucial to store these for later execution.
  - `raw(query, params=None, using=None)`: This method creates a _new_ `RawSQLQuerySet` instance with the provided raw SQL query and parameters. This is what enables chaining â€“ each call returns a new QuerySet object.
  - `all()`: This method executes the raw SQL query using `connection.cursor()`. It fetches the results, iterates through the rows, and constructs model instances from the data using the model's constructor. This is the core of how raw SQL results are turned into Django model instances. It extracts column names from `cursor.description` and uses those to map data to the model fields.
  - `__len__()`: Returns the number of results from the raw query using `SELECT COUNT(*)`. Wrapping the query in a subquery is crucial for correct counting.
  - `__iter__()` and `__getitem__()`: Implement the iterator and indexing/slicing protocols, allowing you to loop through the results and access them by index. The `__getitem__` method caches the results to avoid re-executing the query multiple times when slicing.
  - `filter()`, `exclude()`, `order_by()`, `annotate()`: These methods are intentionally overridden to raise a `NotImplementedError`. Since we're dealing with raw SQL, the Django ORM's filtering and ordering mechanisms are bypassed. The user is expected to handle filtering and ordering within the raw SQL query itself.

- **`RawSQLManager`**: This class inherits from `models.Manager`.
  - `get_queryset()`: Returns a `RawSQLQuerySet` instance. This is the standard way to customize the default QuerySet used by a model.
  - `raw(query, params=None, using=None)`: A convenience method that calls the `raw()` method on the `RawSQLQuerySet`. This provides a clean way to initiate a raw SQL query from the model.

### 2. Integrate the Manager into Your Model

Add the custom manager to your model.

```plaintext
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    value = models.IntegerField()

    objects = RawSQLManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

**Explanation:**

- `objects = RawSQLManager()`: This line replaces the default Django `objects` manager with our custom `RawSQLManager`. Now, when you access `MyModel.objects`, you'll be using our custom manager and QuerySet.

### 3. Using the Custom QuerySet

Now you can use the custom QuerySet to execute raw SQL queries:

```plaintext
# Create some sample data
MyModel.objects.create(name="Item 1", value=10)
MyModel.objects.create(name="Item 2", value=20)
MyModel.objects.create(name="Item 3", value=15)

# Example 1: Basic raw SQL query
results = MyModel.objects.raw("SELECT * FROM myapp_mymodel WHERE value > %s", params=[12])
for item in results:
    print(item.name, item.value)

# Example 2: Using raw SQL for aggregation
results = MyModel.objects.raw("SELECT name, SUM(value) as total_value FROM myapp_mymodel GROUP BY name")
for item in results:
    print(item.name, item.total_value)

# Example 3: Using raw SQL with database-specific functions (PostgreSQL example)
# You would need to adjust the SQL for your specific database
# results = MyModel.objects.raw("SELECT name, value, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY value DESC) as rank FROM myapp_mymodel")
# for item in results:
#     print(item.name, item.value, item.rank)

# Example 4: Getting a single Item using indexing
results = MyModel.objects.raw("SELECT * FROM myapp_mymodel")
first_item = results[0]
print(first_item.name)

# Example 5: Slicing
results = MyModel.objects.raw("SELECT * FROM myapp_mymodel")
sliced_results = results[:2]  # Get the first two items
for item in sliced_results:
    print(item.name)

# Example 6: Getting length
results = MyModel.objects.raw("SELECT * FROM myapp_mymodel")
print(len(results))
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **SQL Injection:** Always use parameterized queries (using `%s` or similar placeholders and passing parameters as a list) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Never directly embed user input into your SQL query strings.
- **Database Compatibility:** Be mindful of database-specific syntax. Raw SQL can make your code less portable if you switch databases.
- **ORM Limitations:** By using raw SQL, you're bypassing Django's ORM, so you lose some of the benefits of automatic query optimization and database abstraction.
- **Model Instantiation:** Ensure your model's constructor (`__init__`) can handle the data returned by your raw SQL query. The column names in your SQL query results should correspond to the model's field names. You may need to alias columns in your SQL query to match the model fields.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Carefully monitor the performance of your raw SQL queries. While they can be faster than ORM queries, they can also be inefficient if not written correctly.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- **Performance:** Potential for significant performance improvements.
- **Flexibility:** Access to database-specific features and optimizations.
- **Integration with Existing SQL:** Easy to reuse existing SQL queries.
- **Chainability:** Still provides a somewhat chainable interface (although limited, you can execute different raw SQL queries sequentially).

**Disadvantages:**

- **SQL Injection Risk:** Requires careful handling of user input to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Database Dependence:** Can make your code less portable.
- **Loss of ORM Benefits:** Bypasses automatic query optimization and database abstraction.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Requires more manual SQL management and potential for errors. It's crucial to test raw SQL queries thoroughly.
- **Limited Chaining**: Unlike standard Django QuerySets, chaining operations like `filter()`, `exclude()`, and `order_by()` are _not_ supported. The raw SQL query defines the filtering and ordering logic.

## Conclusion

Implementing a chainable QuerySet with raw SQL in Django can be a powerful technique for optimizing performance and leveraging database-specific features. However, it's essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully and to prioritize security and maintainability. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can create a custom QuerySet that gives you the best of both worlds: the power of SQL and the convenience of the Django ORM. Remember to always sanitize your inputs, use parameterized queries, and test your SQL thoroughly. While true chainability with ORM methods like `filter()` and `exclude()` isn't directly possible with this approach (due to bypassing the ORM), you can sequentially execute different raw SQL queries using the `raw()` method, achieving a degree of chaining by reassigning the results to a variable.
