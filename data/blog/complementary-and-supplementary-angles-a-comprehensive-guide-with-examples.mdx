# Complementary and Supplementary Angles: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Understanding angles is fundamental to geometry and many other areas of mathematics. Among the many types of angles, **complementary angles** and **supplementary angles** are two important concepts to grasp. This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of what these angle pairs are, how they differ, and how to work with them through examples.

## What are Angles? A Quick Recap

Before diving into complementary and supplementary angles, let's briefly revisit the definition of an angle. An **angle** is formed when two rays (or lines) share a common endpoint, called the vertex. Angles are typically measured in degrees (°). A complete circle contains 360 degrees (360°).

## Complementary Angles: Summing to a Right Angle (90°)

**Complementary angles** are a pair of angles whose measures add up to 90°. A 90° angle is also known as a **right angle**. If two angles are complementary, each angle is considered the _complement_ of the other.

**Definition:** Two angles, ∠A and ∠B, are complementary if:

∠A + ∠B = 90°

**Example 1:**

- Angle A measures 30°
- Angle B measures 60°

Since 30° + 60° = 90°, angles A and B are complementary.

**Example 2:**

If an angle measures 42°, what is the measure of its complement?

Let x be the measure of the complement. We know:

42° + x = 90°

To find x, subtract 42° from both sides:

x = 90° - 42°

x = 48°

Therefore, the complement of a 42° angle is a 48° angle.

**Code Example (JavaScript):**

```plaintext
function findComplementaryAngle(angle) {
  if (angle >= 0 && angle <= 90) {
    return 90 - angle;
  } else {
    return "Invalid input. Angle must be between 0 and 90 degrees.";
  }
}

console.log("The complement of 30 degrees is: " + findComplementaryAngle(30)); // Output: The complement of 30 degrees is: 60
console.log("The complement of 45 degrees is: " + findComplementaryAngle(45)); // Output: The complement of 45 degrees is: 45
console.log("The complement of 100 degrees is: " + findComplementaryAngle(100)); // Output: The complement of 100 degrees is: Invalid input. Angle must be between 0 and 90 degrees.
```

## Supplementary Angles: Summing to a Straight Angle (180°)

**Supplementary angles** are a pair of angles whose measures add up to 180°. A 180° angle is also known as a **straight angle** or a straight line. If two angles are supplementary, each angle is considered the _supplement_ of the other.

**Definition:** Two angles, ∠A and ∠B, are supplementary if:

∠A + ∠B = 180°

**Example 1:**

- Angle A measures 120°
- Angle B measures 60°

Since 120° + 60° = 180°, angles A and B are supplementary.

**Example 2:**

If an angle measures 75°, what is the measure of its supplement?

Let y be the measure of the supplement. We know:

75° + y = 180°

To find y, subtract 75° from both sides:

y = 180° - 75°

y = 105°

Therefore, the supplement of a 75° angle is a 105° angle.

**Code Example (JavaScript):**

```plaintext
function findSupplementaryAngle(angle) {
  if (angle >= 0 && angle <= 180) {
    return 180 - angle;
  } else {
    return "Invalid input. Angle must be between 0 and 180 degrees.";
  }
}

console.log("The supplement of 120 degrees is: " + findSupplementaryAngle(120)); // Output: The supplement of 120 degrees is: 60
console.log("The supplement of 90 degrees is: " + findSupplementaryAngle(90));  // Output: The supplement of 90 degrees is: 90
console.log("The supplement of 200 degrees is: " + findSupplementaryAngle(200)); // Output: The supplement of 200 degrees is: Invalid input. Angle must be between 0 and 180 degrees.
```

## Key Differences: Complementary vs. Supplementary

The key difference between complementary and supplementary angles lies in the sum of their measures:

- **Complementary angles:** add up to 90°
- **Supplementary angles:** add up to 180°

A simple mnemonic to remember this is:

- "**C**omplementary" comes before "**S**upplementary" in the alphabet, and 90 comes before 180.
- Think of "C" as in "Corner" (a right angle, 90°) and "S" as in "Straight" (a straight line, 180°).

## Identifying and Working with Complementary and Supplementary Angles in Geometry

Complementary and supplementary angles often appear in geometric problems. Here are some common scenarios:

- **Triangles:** In a right triangle, the two acute angles (angles less than 90°) are always complementary. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and one angle is 90°, the other two must add up to 90°.
- **Parallel lines and transversals:** When a transversal intersects parallel lines, several angle relationships are formed, including supplementary angles.
- **Angle bisectors:** If an angle is bisected, and then one of the resulting angles is used to form a complementary or supplementary pair, you can use this information to solve for unknown angle measures.

**Example Problem:**

In the figure below, lines AB and CD are parallel, and line EF is a transversal. If ∠1 measures 65°, find the measure of ∠2.

[Insert a diagram here showing parallel lines AB and CD cut by transversal EF, with ∠1 and ∠2 being supplementary angles on the same side of the transversal]

**Solution:**

∠1 and ∠2 are supplementary angles (they lie on the same side of the transversal and are interior angles). Therefore:

∠1 + ∠2 = 180°

65° + ∠2 = 180°

∠2 = 180° - 65°

∠2 = 115°

## Conclusion

Understanding complementary and supplementary angles is crucial for success in geometry and trigonometry. By memorizing the definitions (90° and 180°, respectively) and practicing with examples, you can confidently solve problems involving these important angle relationships. Remember the mnemonics and keep practicing to reinforce your knowledge. Good luck!
