# Trigonometric Identities: A Comprehensive Guide with Formulas and Examples

Trigonometric identities are equations that are true for all values of the variables involved. They are fundamental tools in trigonometry and are used extensively in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Understanding these identities is crucial for simplifying expressions, solving trigonometric equations, and proving theorems. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the most important trigonometric identities, complete with formulas and examples.

## What are Trigonometric Identities?

Trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric functions that hold true for all values of the angles for which the functions are defined. They are derived from the definitions of trigonometric functions and their relationships to the unit circle. Mastering these identities is key to simplifying complex trigonometric expressions and solving related problems.

## Basic Trigonometric Functions

Before diving into the identities, let's briefly review the six basic trigonometric functions:

- **Sine (sin θ):** The ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.
- **Cosine (cos θ):** The ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle.
- **Tangent (tan θ):** The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle, or sin θ / cos θ.
- **Cosecant (csc θ):** The reciprocal of sine, 1 / sin θ.
- **Secant (sec θ):** The reciprocal of cosine, 1 / cos θ.
- **Cotangent (cot θ):** The reciprocal of tangent, 1 / tan θ or cos θ / sin θ.

## Fundamental Trigonometric Identities

These identities are the foundation of trigonometric manipulation and simplification.

### 1. Reciprocal Identities

These identities relate each trigonometric function to its reciprocal.

- `csc θ = 1 / sin θ`
- `sec θ = 1 / cos θ`
- `cot θ = 1 / tan θ`

**Example:** If `sin θ = 0.5`, then `csc θ = 1 / 0.5 = 2`.

### 2. Quotient Identities

These identities define tangent and cotangent in terms of sine and cosine.

- `tan θ = sin θ / cos θ`
- `cot θ = cos θ / sin θ`

**Example:** If `sin θ = √3 / 2` and `cos θ = 1 / 2`, then `tan θ = (√3 / 2) / (1 / 2) = √3`.

### 3. Pythagorean Identities

These are arguably the most important trigonometric identities, derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

- `sin² θ + cos² θ = 1`
- `1 + tan² θ = sec² θ`
- `1 + cot² θ = csc² θ`

**Example:** If `sin θ = 0.6`, then `cos² θ = 1 - sin² θ = 1 - 0.6² = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64`. Therefore, `cos θ = √0.64 = 0.8`.

**Code Example (JavaScript):**

```javascript
function calculateCosine(sinTheta) {
  const cosSquaredTheta = 1 - Math.pow(sinTheta, 2)
  const cosTheta = Math.sqrt(cosSquaredTheta)
  return cosTheta
}

console.log(calculateCosine(0.6)) // Output: 0.8
```

## Angle Sum and Difference Identities

These identities express trigonometric functions of sums and differences of angles.

- `sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B`
- `sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B`
- `cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B`
- `cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B`
- `tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)`
- `tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B) / (1 + tan A tan B)`

**Example:** Find `sin(75°)`. We can write `75° = 45° + 30°`. Using the `sin(A + B)` identity:

`sin(75°) = sin(45° + 30°) = sin 45° cos 30° + cos 45° sin 30°`
`= (√2 / 2)(√3 / 2) + (√2 / 2)(1 / 2) = (√6 + √2) / 4`

## Double-Angle Identities

These identities express trigonometric functions of double angles.

- `sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ`
- `cos 2θ = cos² θ - sin² θ = 2 cos² θ - 1 = 1 - 2 sin² θ`
- `tan 2θ = (2 tan θ) / (1 - tan² θ)`

**Example:** If `sin θ = 0.8` and `cos θ = 0.6`, then `sin 2θ = 2 * 0.8 * 0.6 = 0.96`.

**Code Example (Python):**

```plaintext
import math

def double_angle_sine(theta_rad):
  """Calculates sin(2θ) given θ in radians."""
  return 2 * math.sin(theta_rad) * math.cos(theta_rad)

theta = math.pi / 6 # 30 degrees in radians
print(double_angle_sine(theta)) # Output: ~0.866 (sin(60 degrees))
```

## Half-Angle Identities

These identities express trigonometric functions of half angles.

- `sin (θ/2) = ±√((1 - cos θ) / 2)`
- `cos (θ/2) = ±√((1 + cos θ) / 2)`
- `tan (θ/2) = ±√((1 - cos θ) / (1 + cos θ)) = sin θ / (1 + cos θ) = (1 - cos θ) / sin θ`

The sign (`±`) depends on the quadrant in which `θ/2` lies.

**Example:** Find `sin(15°)`. We can write `15° = 30° / 2`. Using the `sin (θ/2)` identity:

`sin(15°) = sin(30° / 2) = √((1 - cos 30°) / 2) = √((1 - √3 / 2) / 2) = √((2 - √3) / 4) = √(2 - √3) / 2`

## Product-to-Sum Identities

These identities express products of trigonometric functions as sums or differences.

- `sin A cos B = (1/2)[sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)]`
- `cos A sin B = (1/2)[sin(A + B) - sin(A - B)]`
- `cos A cos B = (1/2)[cos(A + B) + cos(A - B)]`
- `sin A sin B = (1/2)[cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)]`

**Example:** Simplify `2 sin 5x cos 3x`. Using the `sin A cos B` identity:

`2 sin 5x cos 3x = 2 * (1/2)[sin(5x + 3x) + sin(5x - 3x)] = sin(8x) + sin(2x)`

## Sum-to-Product Identities

These identities express sums or differences of trigonometric functions as products.

- `sin A + sin B = 2 sin((A + B) / 2) cos((A - B) / 2)`
- `sin A - sin B = 2 cos((A + B) / 2) sin((A - B) / 2)`
- `cos A + cos B = 2 cos((A + B) / 2) cos((A - B) / 2)`
- `cos A - cos B = -2 sin((A + B) / 2) sin((A - B) / 2)`

**Example:** Simplify `cos 5x - cos x`. Using the `cos A - cos B` identity:

`cos 5x - cos x = -2 sin((5x + x) / 2) sin((5x - x) / 2) = -2 sin(3x) sin(2x)`
