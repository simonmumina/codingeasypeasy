# Expo Apple Authentication: A Comprehensive Guide with React Native

Apple Authentication (Sign In with Apple) is a convenient and secure way for users to sign in to your app with their Apple ID. It's not just a nice-to-have; in many cases, Apple requires apps that offer third-party sign-in options (like Google or Facebook) to also offer Sign In with Apple. This guide will walk you through implementing Apple Authentication in your React Native Expo application.

## Why Use Apple Authentication?

- **Privacy Focus:** Apple Authentication emphasizes user privacy. Users can choose to share their real email address or a private relay email address with your app.
- **Security:** Leverages Apple's existing security infrastructure for a safer sign-in experience.
- **User Convenience:** Streamlines the sign-in process, especially for users already logged into their Apple ID on their iOS devices.
- **Apple Requirement:** As mentioned before, it's often a requirement if your app uses other social sign-in methods.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following:

- **Expo CLI:** Installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`).
- **Expo Project:** An existing Expo project (created with `expo init`).
- **Apple Developer Account:** You'll need an active Apple Developer account to configure your app.
- **Apple Device (iPhone or iPad):** The Sign In with Apple functionality needs to be tested on a real Apple device. It doesn't work in the iOS Simulator.

## Step 1: Setting up Your Apple Developer Account

1.  **Enable Sign In with Apple Capability:**

    - Go to your [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/).
    - Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**.
    - Select **Identifiers** and find your app's identifier (Bundle ID).
    - Click on your app identifier to edit its configuration.
    - Under **Capabilities**, make sure the **Sign In with Apple** option is checked. If it's not there, you may need to enable it as an entitlement.

2.  **Configure your App ID:**

    - Ensure your App ID is correctly configured to use Sign In with Apple.

3.  **Create a Services ID (optional, but recommended for backend verification):**

    - In the **Identifiers** section, click the **+** button to create a new identifier.
    - Select **Services IDs** and click **Continue**.
    - Provide a description and an identifier (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp.auth`). This should be _different_ from your app's Bundle ID.
    - Check the **Sign In with Apple** capability.
    - Configure the **Return URLs**. This is a crucial step! These URLs are where Apple will redirect the user after successful authentication. Typically you would point this to a server endpoint which will then call `verifyIdToken` to secure against replay attacks. Add at least one valid return URL (e.g., `https://your-backend-domain.com/auth/apple/callback`). You can add multiple for development, staging and production.

## Step 2: Installing the Expo Apple Authentication Package

Install the `expo-apple-authentication` package in your Expo project:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-apple-authentication
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Authentication Flow in Your React Native Component

Here's the code for a simple React Native component that demonstrates the authentication flow:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View, Text, TouchableOpacity, Alert, Platform } from 'react-native'
import * as AppleAuthentication from 'expo-apple-authentication'
import * as Crypto from 'expo-crypto'

export default function App() {
  const [credentialState, setCredentialState] = useState(null)

  const onSignIn = async () => {
    try {
      // Generate a secure random nonce
      const rawNonce = await Crypto.generateUUID()
      const appleId =
        Platform.OS === 'ios' || Platform.OS === 'macos'
          ? {
              useExistingSession: true,
            }
          : {}

      const nonce = await Crypto.digestStringAsync(Crypto.CryptoDigestAlgorithm.SHA256, rawNonce)
      const appleAuthRequestResponse = await AppleAuthentication.signInAsync({
        requestedScopes: [
          AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationScope.FULL_NAME,
          AppleAuthentication.AppleAuthenticationScope.EMAIL,
        ],
        nonce: nonce,
        ...appleId,
      })

      if (appleAuthRequestResponse && appleAuthRequestResponse.identityToken) {
        console.log('Apple Authentication Successful:', appleAuthRequestResponse)

        // Here you would typically send the identityToken, fullName, and email to your backend for verification.
        // Your backend would then verify the identityToken with Apple's servers and create or update the user account.
        // You also need to verify the nonce on the backend!

        Alert.alert(
          'Sign In Successful!',
          `User ID: ${appleAuthRequestResponse.user}, Full Name: ${appleAuthRequestResponse.fullName?.givenName} ${appleAuthRequestResponse.fullName?.familyName}, Email: ${appleAuthRequestResponse.email}`
        )
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Sign In Cancelled or Failed')
        console.log('Apple Authentication Failed', appleAuthRequestResponse)
      }

      if (Platform.OS === 'ios' || Platform.OS === 'macos') {
        const credentialState = await AppleAuthentication.getCredentialStateForUserAsync(
          appleAuthRequestResponse.user
        )
        setCredentialState(credentialState)
      }
    } catch (e) {
      if (e.code === 'ERR_REQUEST_CANCELED') {
        // User cancelled the sign-in flow.
        console.log('User cancelled the sign-in flow.')
        Alert.alert('Sign In Cancelled')
      } else {
        console.error('Error during Apple Authentication:', e)
        Alert.alert('Sign In Error', e.message)
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={onSignIn}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Sign In with Apple</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      {(Platform.OS === 'ios' || Platform.OS === 'macos') && credentialState !== null && (
        <Text style={styles.credentialStateText}>Credential State: {credentialState}</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  button: {
    backgroundColor: '#000',
    padding: 15,
    borderRadius: 10,
    marginTop: 20,
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  credentialStateText: {
    marginTop: 20,
    fontSize: 14,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** Imports React, `expo-apple-authentication`, `expo-crypto`, and React Native components.
2.  **`onSignIn` function:**
    - **Generates a Nonce:** Critically important for security, this is a unique random string. This prevents replay attacks. A secure nonce should always be included!
    - **`AppleAuthentication.signInAsync`:** Initiates the sign-in flow. It requests the user's full name and email address.
    - **Handling the Response:** The response contains:
      - `identityToken`: A JWT (JSON Web Token) that you need to send to your backend for verification.
      - `user`: A unique user identifier.
      - `fullName`: The user's full name (if granted permission).
      - `email`: The user's email address (if granted permission).
    - **Error Handling:** Handles scenarios where the user cancels the sign-in or an error occurs.
    - **Credential State Check (iOS/macOS only):** Shows how to use `getCredentialStateForUserAsync` to get the user's credential state. This is useful for detecting if the user has revoked access.
3.  **UI:** A simple button triggers the `onSignIn` function.
4.  **Use Existing Session**: Added functionality to use existing session so it will not prompt for login every time.

## Step 4: Backend Verification (Crucial for Security!)

**Never trust the data received directly from the client-side Apple Authentication SDK.** You **must** verify the `identityToken` on your backend.

Here's a basic example (using Node.js and the `node-jsonwebtoken` and `jwks-rsa` packages):

```javascript
// Example using Node.js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
const jwksClient = require('jwks-rsa')

const client = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: 'https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys',
})

function getKey(header, callback) {
  client.getSigningKey(header.kid, function (err, key) {
    const signingKey = key.publicKey || key.rsaPublicKey
    callback(null, signingKey)
  })
}

async function verifyAppleToken(identityToken, nonce) {
  try {
    const decodedToken = jwt.decode(identityToken, { complete: true })

    if (!decodedToken || !decodedToken.header || !decodedToken.header.kid) {
      throw new Error('Invalid identity token.')
    }

    const publicKey = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      getKey(decodedToken.header, (err, key) => {
        if (err) {
          reject(err)
        } else {
          resolve(key)
        }
      })
    })

    const verifiedToken = jwt.verify(identityToken, publicKey, {
      algorithms: ['RS256'],
      audience: process.env.APPLE_CLIENT_ID, // Your Service ID or App ID.  IMPORTANT!
      issuer: 'https://appleid.apple.com',
    })

    // VERY IMPORTANT: Verify the nonce!!!
    if (verifiedToken.nonce !== nonce) {
      throw new Error('Invalid Nonce')
    }

    return verifiedToken
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error verifying Apple token:', error)
    throw error
  }
}

// Example usage (in an Express route handler):
app.post('/auth/apple/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { identityToken, nonce } = req.body

  try {
    const verifiedToken = await verifyAppleToken(identityToken, nonce)
    // Access user information from verifiedToken (e.g., verifiedToken.sub is the user ID)
    console.log('Verified Token:', verifiedToken)
    // Create or update user in your database based on the user ID.
    // ... your database logic here ...

    res.json({ success: true, message: 'Authentication successful!' })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Verification failed:', error)
    res.status(401).json({ success: false, error: error.message })
  }
})
```

**Key points:**

- **`jwks-rsa`:** This package is used to retrieve Apple's public keys. These keys are used to verify the signature of the `identityToken`.
- **`jsonwebtoken`:** Used to decode and verify the JWT.
- **`APPLE_CLIENT_ID`:** This **must** be your **Service ID** (created in the Apple Developer portal) if you created one. If not, use your **App ID**. This ensures the token is intended for _your_ application.
- **`nonce` Verification:** **CRITICAL!** Compare the `nonce` you generated on the client-side with the `nonce` claim in the decoded token. This prevents replay attacks.
- **Error Handling:** Handle verification errors gracefully.
- **Database Integration:** After successful verification, create or update the user's account in your database.
- **Issuer Verification:** Validate the token's issuer, which should always be `https://appleid.apple.com`.
- **Audience Verification:** Confirm that the `aud` (audience) claim in the token matches your App ID or Service ID. This ensures the token is intended for your application.

**Important Security Considerations:**

- **HTTPS:** Your entire authentication flow (including the callback endpoint) **must** use HTTPS.
- **Nonce Generation:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator for generating the `nonce`. `expo-crypto` provides this functionality.
- **Backend Verification:** **Never skip backend verification.** Client-side verification alone is insecure.

## Step 5: Testing

1.  **Run Your Expo App on a Real Device:** Apple Authentication only works on real iOS or macOS devices. Run your Expo app using `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android` (Android will not trigger the Apple Sign In).
2.  **Tap the "Sign In with Apple" Button:** The Apple Authentication sheet should appear.
3.  **Follow the Prompts:** Choose whether to share your real email address or use the private relay email address.
4.  **Verify on Your Backend:** Check your backend logs to confirm that the `identityToken` is successfully verified.
5.  **Credential State (iOS/macOS only):** If you enabled the credential state check, ensure that the state is displayed correctly.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **"Sign In with Apple" Button Not Showing:**
  - Make sure you've enabled the Sign In with Apple capability in your Apple Developer account.
  - Ensure your bundle identifier is correctly configured.
  - You must test on a real device, not the simulator.
- **Invalid Redirect URI:**
  - Double-check that the Return URLs configured in your Apple Developer account match the URL your app is using for the callback.
- **Token Verification Errors:**
  - Ensure that your backend is correctly retrieving and using Apple's public keys.
  - Verify the `aud` (audience) and `iss` (issuer) claims in the token.
  - Make sure you are verifying the `nonce` correctly. This is a very common error.
- **Platform Check:** The `useExistingSession` parameter is only valid on iOS and macOS. Wrap your `AppleAuthentication.signInAsync` call with a `Platform.OS` check.

## Conclusion

Implementing Apple Authentication in your React Native Expo app requires a bit of configuration, but it's crucial for providing a secure and user-friendly sign-in experience. Remember to prioritize backend verification to protect your app and your users. This guide provides a solid foundation for integrating Apple Authentication into your projects. Always refer to the official Apple and Expo documentation for the most up-to-date information.
