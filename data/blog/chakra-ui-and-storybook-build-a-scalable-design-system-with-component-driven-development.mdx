# Chakra UI and Storybook: Build a Scalable Design System with Component Driven Development

Storybook is a powerful tool for developing UI components in isolation. Chakra UI, on the other hand, is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build React applications. When combined, they create a robust workflow for building, testing, and documenting a design system or UI library. This post will guide you through integrating Chakra UI with Storybook to enhance your component development process.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is an open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation. It allows you to build, test, and document your components without having to worry about the complexities of your application's codebase. It offers features like:

- **Isolation:** Develop components in isolation from the rest of your application.
- **Documentation:** Automatically generate documentation for your components.
- **Testing:** Test components visually and interactively.
- **Addons:** Extend Storybook's functionality with a wide range of addons.
- **Collaboration:** Share your components and stories with your team.

## Why Use Chakra UI with Storybook?

- **Component-Driven Development (CDD):** Storybook promotes CDD, allowing you to focus on individual components before integrating them into your application. Chakra UI's composable components fit perfectly into this workflow.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Chakra UI prioritizes accessibility (a11y). Storybook allows you to visually test your components for accessibility issues using addons like `storybook-addon-a11y`.
- **Visual Regression Testing:** Tools like Chromatic (from Storybook) or others can be used to automatically detect visual regressions in your components, ensuring consistent design across your application.
- **Design System Documentation:** Storybook serves as a living style guide, documenting your components and their usage with Chakra UI's styling.
- **Collaboration and Consistency:** Storybook enables your team to work on components in isolation, promoting consistency and reducing merge conflicts.

## Setting Up Your Project

Let's start by creating a new React project using Create React App (or your preferred method). Then, we'll install Chakra UI and Storybook.

```plaintext
npx create-react-app chakra-storybook-example
cd chakra-storybook-example
```

Next, install Chakra UI and its dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

Finally, initialize Storybook:

```plaintext
npx storybook init
```

This command will automatically detect your project's dependencies and configure Storybook for React.

## Configuring Chakra UI in Storybook

To use Chakra UI within Storybook, you need to wrap your stories with the `ChakraProvider`. This makes Chakra UI's theming and styling available to your components in the Storybook environment.

1.  **Create a `.storybook/preview.js` file (if it doesn't already exist).** This file is used to configure Storybook's behavior.

2.  **Add the following code to `preview.js`:**

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { theme } from '../src/theme' // Import your Chakra UI theme

export const parameters = {
  actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
  controls: {
    matchers: {
      color: /(background|color)$/i,
      date: /Date$/,
    },
  },
}

export const decorators = [
  (Story) => (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <Story />
    </ChakraProvider>
  ),
]
```

**Explanation:**

- `ChakraProvider`: Wraps each story, providing the Chakra UI context.
- `theme`: You should create a `theme.js` file in your `src` directory to customize your Chakra UI theme. If you don't have one, Chakra UI will use the default theme.
- `decorators`: Storybook uses decorators to wrap each story with additional functionality. In this case, we're wrapping each story with the `ChakraProvider`.
- `parameters`: This object configures global Storybook parameters like action handlers and control matchers.

**Example `src/theme.js` (optional):**

```javascript
// src/theme.js
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    brand: {
      900: '#1a365d',
      800: '#153e75',
      700: '#2a69ac',
    },
  },
})

export default theme
```

## Creating Your First Story with Chakra UI

Now that we've configured Storybook, let's create a simple component and its corresponding story.

1.  **Create a `src/components/Button.jsx` file:**

```jsx
// src/components/Button.jsx
import { Button as ChakraButton } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const Button = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  return <ChakraButton {...props}>{children}</ChakraButton>
}

export default Button
```

2.  **Create a `src/components/Button.stories.jsx` file:**

```jsx
// src/components/Button.stories.jsx
import React from 'react'
import Button from './Button'

export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
  argTypes: {
    variant: {
      control: 'select',
      options: ['primary', 'secondary', 'ghost', 'link'],
    },
    size: {
      control: 'select',
      options: ['sm', 'md', 'lg'],
    },
    onClick: { action: 'clicked' },
  },
}

const Template = (args) => <Button {...args}>Click Me</Button>

export const Primary = Template.bind({})
Primary.args = {
  variant: 'primary',
}

export const Secondary = Template.bind({})
Secondary.args = {
  variant: 'secondary',
}

export const Large = Template.bind({})
Large.args = {
  size: 'lg',
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `title`: Defines the component's location in the Storybook navigation.
- `component`: Specifies the component being documented.
- `argTypes`: Defines the props that can be controlled in the Storybook UI. We use `control: 'select'` to create dropdowns for `variant` and `size`. `onClick: { action: 'clicked' }` sets up an action logger that displays when the button is clicked.
- `Template`: A function that renders the component with the provided arguments.
- `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Large`: Named exports that represent different states or variations of the component. We set `args` to define the initial values for each variation.

Now, run Storybook:

```plaintext
npm run storybook
```

You should see your `Button` component in the Storybook UI, with controls for the `variant` and `size` props. You can interact with the button and see the "clicked" action in the Actions panel.

## Using Storybook Addons

Storybook has a rich ecosystem of addons that can enhance your component development workflow. Here are a few particularly useful addons for working with Chakra UI:

- **`storybook-addon-a11y`:** Helps you identify accessibility issues in your components. Install it with `npm install --save-dev @storybook/addon-a11y` and add `'@storybook/addon-a11y'` to your `main.js` file (located in the `.storybook` directory).
- **`@storybook/addon-controls`:** Already configured by default, it allows you to interactively control component props directly within the Storybook UI.
- **`@storybook/addon-viewport`:** Allows you to view your components at different screen sizes.

**Example using `storybook-addon-a11y`:**

After installing and configuring the a11y addon, Storybook will automatically run accessibility checks on your components and display any warnings or errors in the Accessibility panel. This helps you ensure that your Chakra UI components are accessible to all users.

## Best Practices

- **Keep your stories focused:** Each story should represent a specific use case or state of your component.
- **Use clear and descriptive titles:** This will make it easier to find and understand your components in Storybook.
- **Leverage argTypes:** Define the props that can be controlled in the Storybook UI to make it easier to experiment with your components.
- **Write tests:** Use Storybook's testing capabilities to ensure that your components behave as expected.
- **Document your components:** Use Storybook's documentation capabilities to provide clear and concise documentation for your components.
- **Customize Your Theme:** Tailor your Chakra UI theme to match your project's design language.
- **Organize Your Stories:** Use Storybook's folder structure to keep your stories organized. This makes it easier to navigate and maintain your component library.

## Conclusion

Integrating Chakra UI with Storybook provides a powerful and efficient workflow for building, testing, and documenting React components. By leveraging Storybook's features and Chakra UI's accessible component library, you can create a scalable and maintainable design system that promotes consistency and collaboration within your team. This guide provides a solid foundation for getting started. Experiment with different components, explore Storybook addons, and customize your workflow to fit your specific needs.
