# Internationalization (i18n) with Clerk: A Deep Dive into @clerk/localizations

Reaching a global audience requires more than just translating your website. It demands a deep understanding of cultural nuances and linguistic preferences. When it comes to authentication, a localized experience can significantly improve user engagement and trust. That's where `@clerk/localizations` comes in. This package empowers you to seamlessly internationalize your Clerk authentication flows, providing a truly personalized and welcoming experience for users worldwide.

## What is `@clerk/localizations`?

`@clerk/localizations` is a powerful package offered by Clerk that provides pre-built, high-quality translations for Clerk's authentication UI components. It eliminates the need for you to manually translate every single label, button, and message, saving you valuable time and effort. More importantly, it ensures consistency and accuracy across all locales.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Comprehensive Translations:** Offers a vast library of translations for various languages, covering all aspects of Clerk's authentication flow.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed for seamless integration with Clerk's React components.
- **Customizable:** Provides mechanisms to override and customize existing translations or add your own.
- **Up-to-date:** Maintained by the Clerk team, ensuring translations stay consistent with Clerk's latest features and updates.
- **Improved User Experience:** Creates a more welcoming and user-friendly experience for users from different cultural backgrounds.

## Getting Started with `@clerk/localizations`

Let's walk through the process of integrating `@clerk/localizations` into your React or Next.js application.

**1. Installation:**

First, install the `@clerk/localizations` package using your preferred package manager:

```plaintext
npm install @clerk/localizations
# or
yarn add @clerk/localizations
# or
pnpm add @clerk/localizations
```

**2. Import and Use:**

Import the desired localization pack and pass it to the `<ClerkProvider>` component (usually in your `_app.tsx` or `_app.jsx` file for Next.js, or your root app component for React).

```jsx
// _app.tsx (Next.js example)
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { enUS } from '@clerk/localizations';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: any) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider localization={enUS}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

In this example, we're importing the `enUS` (English - United States) localization pack and passing it to the `localization` prop of the `ClerkProvider`. This will automatically apply the English translations to all of Clerk's authentication components within your application.

**3. Supported Locales:**

`@clerk/localizations` offers a wide range of pre-built localization packs. You can find a complete list in the [Clerk documentation](https://clerk.com/docs) (search for "@clerk/localizations" and look for the supported locales section). Common locales include:

- `enUS` (English - United States)
- `deDE` (German - Germany)
- `esES` (Spanish - Spain)
- `frFR` (French - France)
- `jaJP` (Japanese - Japan)
- `zhCN` (Chinese - China)
- And many more!

**4. Dynamic Locale Switching (Next.js Example):**

A common requirement is to dynamically switch locales based on user preferences, browser settings, or URL parameters. Here's how you can achieve this in a Next.js application using `next-i18next` (a popular i18n library for Next.js) in conjunction with `@clerk/localizations`.

- **Install `next-i18next`:**

  ```plaintext
  npm install next-i18next i18next
  # or
  yarn add next-i18next i18next
  # or
  pnpm add next-i18next i18next
  ```

- **Configure `next-i18next`:**

  Create a `next-i18next.config.js` file in the root of your project:

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    i18n: {
      defaultLocale: 'en',
      locales: ['en', 'de', 'es'], // Add supported locales
    },
  }
  ```

- **Update `_app.tsx`:**

  ```jsx
  // _app.tsx
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';
  import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
  import { appWithTranslation } from 'next-i18next';
  import { enUS, deDE, esES } from '@clerk/localizations';

  const localizationMap = {
    en: enUS,
    de: deDE,
    es: esES,
  };

  function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: any) {
    const { locale } = useRouter();
    const localization = localizationMap[locale as keyof typeof localizationMap] || enUS; // Default to enUS if locale not found

    return (
      <ClerkProvider localization={localization}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ClerkProvider>
    );
  }

  export default appWithTranslation(MyApp);
  ```

  **Explanation:**

  - We import `useRouter` from `next/router` to access the current locale.
  - We import `appWithTranslation` from `next-i18next` to wrap our `MyApp` component and enable i18n functionality.
  - We create a `localizationMap` object that maps locale codes (e.g., 'en', 'de', 'es') to the corresponding Clerk localization packs.
  - Inside the `MyApp` component, we retrieve the current locale using `useRouter().locale`.
  - We use the `localizationMap` to look up the appropriate localization pack for the current locale. If the locale is not found, we default to `enUS`.
  - We pass the retrieved `localization` pack to the `ClerkProvider`.

- **Create Locale Files:**

  Create locale files in the `public/locales` directory (e.g., `public/locales/en/common.json`, `public/locales/de/common.json`, `public/locales/es/common.json`). These files can contain translations for other parts of your application that are not handled by Clerk. You'll need to create `common.json` (or whatever you name your namespace) inside each locale directory (en, de, es, etc.).

  ```json
  // public/locales/en/common.json
  {
    "title": "My Awesome App",
    "welcome": "Welcome to our application!"
  }
  ```

  ```json
  // public/locales/de/common.json
  {
    "title": "Meine tolle App",
    "welcome": "Willkommen zu unserer Anwendung!"
  }
  ```

- **Using Translations:**

  You can now access translations from your locale files using the `useTranslation` hook provided by `next-i18next`.

  ```jsx
  import { useTranslation } from 'next-i18next'

  function HomePage() {
    const { t } = useTranslation('common')

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
        <p>{t('welcome')}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }

  export default HomePage
  ```

**5. Customizing Translations:**

`@clerk/localizations` allows you to override specific translations if you need to tailor the text to your brand or specific use case. You can do this by passing a `localization` object with overrides to the `ClerkProvider`.

```jsx
// _app.tsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { enUS } from '@clerk/localizations';

const customLocalization = {
  ...enUS,
  socialButtons: {
    ...enUS.socialButtons,
    continueWithGoogle: 'Sign in with Google', // Override the Google sign-in button text
  },
  form: {
    ...enUS.form,
    signUp: {
      ...enUS.form.signUp,
      createAccount: "Let's get started!",  //Customizes "Create Account" button text during signup
    },
  },
};

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: any) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider localization={customLocalization}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

**Explanation:**

- We create a `customLocalization` object.
- We spread the original `enUS` localization pack into the `customLocalization` object.
- We override the `continueWithGoogle` text within the `socialButtons` property. We also overide the `createAccount` text within the `form.signUp` property.
- We pass the `customLocalization` object to the `ClerkProvider`.

By using this approach, you can selectively override specific translations while retaining all the other translations from the original localization pack.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your localized authentication flows to ensure that all translations are accurate and appropriate for the target locale. Consider using automated testing tools or manual testing with native speakers.
- **Context:** Pay attention to the context of each translation. The same word or phrase can have different meanings depending on the context.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or inappropriate in certain cultures.
- **Right-to-Left Languages:** If you're supporting right-to-left languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew), ensure that your UI is properly mirrored to accommodate the text direction. Clerk's components are designed to handle this automatically.
- **Contribution:** If you find that a translation is missing or inaccurate, consider contributing to the `@clerk/localizations` package on GitHub. Your contributions can help improve the experience for other users worldwide.

## Advanced Usage

- **Typescript Support:** `@clerk/localizations` is written in TypeScript and provides excellent type definitions, making it easier to work with the localization packs and ensuring type safety in your code.

- **Asynchronous Loading:** For large applications with many locales, you might want to consider asynchronously loading localization packs to improve initial page load performance. You can use the `import()` function to dynamically import the localization pack when the component is rendered.

  ```jsx
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: any) {
    const [localization, setLocalization] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      async function loadLocalization() {
        const locale = 'de'; // Get locale from somewhere
        try {
          const localizationPack = await import(`@clerk/localizations/dist/locales/${locale}`).then(module => module[locale]);
          setLocalization(localizationPack);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error loading localization:", error);
          // Fallback to default
          const enUS = await import(`@clerk/localizations`).then(module => module.enUS);
          setLocalization(enUS)
        }
      }

      loadLocalization();
    }, []);

    if (!localization) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>; // Or a fallback UI
    }

    return (
      <ClerkProvider localization={localization}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ClerkProvider>
    );
  }

  export default MyApp;

  ```

  **Warning:** Ensure that your dynamic import path is valid and points to the correct localization file. Also, handle potential errors during the import process gracefully and provide a fallback mechanism. Using ES dynamic imports within the `ClerkProvider` is not officially recommended, it should only be used if absolutely necessary and only if you understand the consequences. Ensure that you import `enUS` by default and provide a fallback if there is an error fetching the locale.
