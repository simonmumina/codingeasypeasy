# Access WSL2 from Another Device on Your Local Network: A Comprehensive Guide

Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is a powerful tool that allows you to run Linux distributions directly on Windows without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine. However, by default, WSL2 is isolated within your Windows environment. This means you can't directly access services running inside your WSL2 instance from other devices on your local network.

This blog post provides a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to access WSL2 from another device on your local network using port forwarding with the `netsh interface portproxy` command. We'll cover the necessary configurations, common pitfalls, and troubleshooting tips to ensure you can seamlessly access your Linux applications running on WSL2 from anywhere on your network.

## Understanding the Problem

By default, WSL2 operates behind a virtual network adapter managed by Windows. This network adapter has its own IP address and network settings, isolated from your primary network interface. When a service (like a web server) runs inside WSL2, it listens on a specific port within the WSL2 network. To access this service from another device on your local network, you need to forward traffic from your Windows host's network adapter to the WSL2 network adapter and the specific port where the service is listening.

## Solution: Port Forwarding with `netsh interface portproxy`

The `netsh interface portproxy` command is a powerful tool in Windows for configuring port forwarding. It allows you to redirect traffic from a specific port on your Windows host to a different port on a different IP address (in this case, the WSL2 IP address).

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Determine the WSL2 IP Address:**

   - Open your WSL2 terminal.
   - Run the `ip addr` command:
     ```plaintext
     ip addr
     ```
   - Look for the `eth0` interface (or a similar interface name, depending on your distribution). The IP address associated with this interface is your WSL2 IP address. It will typically be in the `172.x.x.x` range. Make a note of it. **Crucially, this IP address can change when WSL2 restarts, so we'll address making this static later.**

     ```plaintext
     1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
         link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
         inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
     2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
         link/ether 00:15:5d:29:3d:6f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
         inet 172.22.34.181/20 brd 172.22.47.255 scope global eth0
            valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
     ```

     In this example, the WSL2 IP address is `172.22.34.181`.

2. **Identify the Port to Forward:**

   - This is the port your service is listening on within WSL2. For example, if you're running a web server on port 8000, you'll need to forward traffic to port 8000.

3. **Execute the `netsh` Command (from an Elevated Command Prompt):**

   - Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.
   - Use the following command, replacing `<Windows_IP_Address>`, `<WSL2_IP_Address>`, and `<Port>` with the appropriate values:

     ```plaintext
     netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=<Windows_IP_Address> listenport=<Port> connectaddress=<WSL2_IP_Address> connectport=<Port>
     ```

     - `listenaddress=<Windows_IP_Address>`: This is the IP address of your Windows machine's network adapter. To listen on all available network interfaces on your Windows machine, use `0.0.0.0`. This is usually the best practice.
     - `listenport=<Port>`: This is the port you want to forward _from_ your Windows machine.
     - `connectaddress=<WSL2_IP_Address>`: This is the WSL2 IP address you obtained in step 1.
     - `connectport=<Port>`: This is the port your service is listening on _within_ WSL2. This is often the same as the `listenport`, but it doesn't _have_ to be.

     **Example:** If your Windows IP address is `192.168.1.100`, your WSL2 IP address is `172.22.34.181`, and your service is listening on port 8000, the command would be:

     ```plaintext
     netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=8000 connectaddress=172.22.34.181 connectport=8000
     ```

4. **Verify the Port Forwarding Rule:**

   - You can verify that the port forwarding rule has been created successfully by running the following command in the elevated Command Prompt:

     ```plaintext
     netsh interface portproxy show all
     ```

   - This will display a list of all active port forwarding rules. You should see the rule you just created.

5. **Test the Connection:**
   - From another device on your local network, open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or `telnet` to connect to your Windows machine's IP address on the forwarded port. For example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`. Replace `192.168.1.100` with the IP address of the Windows machine running WSL2. If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to access the service running within your WSL2 environment.

## Making the WSL2 IP Address Static (Important!)

As mentioned earlier, the WSL2 IP address can change each time you restart WSL2 or your computer. This will break your port forwarding rules. To address this, we need to make the WSL2 IP address static. There are several ways to do this; here's a common and effective method:

1. **Create a Script to Update the `netsh` Rules:**

   Create a `.bat` file (e.g., `update_wsl_ports.bat`) on your Windows machine with the following content. **Replace `8000` with the actual port you are forwarding.** This script will:

   - Get the current WSL2 IP address.
   - Delete the existing portproxy rule for port 8000.
   - Add a new portproxy rule with the current WSL2 IP address.

   ```plaintext
   @echo off
   for /f "tokens=2 delims=: " %%a in ('wsl.exe ip addr show eth0 ^| grep "inet "') do (
       set WSL_IP=%%a
   )

   echo Current WSL2 IP: %WSL_IP%

   netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=8000
   netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=8000 connectaddress=%WSL_IP% connectport=8000

   echo Port forwarding updated successfully!
   pause
   ```

2. **Run the Script as Administrator:**

   Right-click the `update_wsl_ports.bat` file and select "Run as administrator."

3. **Schedule the Script to Run on Startup (Optional):**

   You can schedule this script to run automatically whenever your computer starts. This will ensure that the port forwarding rules are always updated with the correct WSL2 IP address.

   - Open the Task Scheduler (search for "Task Scheduler" in the Windows search bar).
   - Create a new basic task.
   - Name the task (e.g., "Update WSL2 Port Forwarding").
   - Set the trigger to "When the computer starts."
   - Set the action to "Start a program."
   - Browse to the `update_wsl_ports.bat` file.
   - Check the box "Open properties dialog for this task when I click Finish."
   - In the properties dialog, go to the "General" tab and check the "Run with highest privileges" box. This is crucial!
   - Click OK.

**Important Considerations for Static IP Assignment**

While the above script handles dynamically updating the forwarding rules based on the WSL2 IP, some users prefer a truly _static_ IP within WSL2. This can be achieved, but involves modifying the WSL distribution's network configuration files (usually `/etc/network/interfaces` or similar, depending on the distribution). This is a more advanced topic and can potentially break WSL2 networking if not done carefully. Using the dynamic update script is generally recommended for most users.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

- **Firewall Issues:** Windows Firewall might be blocking the traffic. Make sure to create an inbound rule that allows traffic on the forwarded port for the `TCP` protocol. Go to "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" and add a new Inbound Rule.

- **Incorrect IP Address:** Double-check that you're using the correct WSL2 IP address and Windows IP address.

- **Port Already in Use:** Another application might be using the port you're trying to forward. Use `netstat -ano | findstr :<Port>` (replace `<Port>` with the port number) in the command prompt to see what process is listening on that port.

- **WSL2 Not Running:** Ensure that your WSL2 distribution is running before attempting to access it from another device.

- **Subnet Conflicts:** In rare cases, subnet conflicts between your Windows network and the WSL2 network can cause issues. Changing the WSL2 network address range (requires advanced configuration) might be necessary.

- **Admin Privileges:** The `netsh` command requires administrator privileges. Make sure you're running the Command Prompt as an administrator.

- **Conflicting Portproxy Rules:** Delete any existing `netsh interface portproxy` rules that might be conflicting with your new rule. Use `netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=<Port>` to delete a specific rule.

## Security Considerations

- **Exposing Services to Your Local Network:** Be aware that forwarding ports exposes the services running within WSL2 to your entire local network. Ensure that the services are properly secured and that you understand the security implications of exposing them.

- **Avoid Port Forwarding to the Internet (Generally):** This guide is for accessing WSL2 on your _local_ network. Forwarding ports directly to the internet is generally _not_ recommended without proper security measures (like VPNs and strong authentication) as it can expose your system to potential attacks.

## Alternatives to `netsh interface portproxy`

While `netsh interface portproxy` is the most common method, other options exist, although they are generally more complex:

- **Using a Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx):** You can set up a reverse proxy on your Windows host to forward traffic to the WSL2 instance. This provides more flexibility and control over the traffic flow but requires more configuration.

- **VPN:** A VPN provides a secure tunnel between your devices and your WSL2 environment. This is the most secure option but requires a VPN server to be set up.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should be able to successfully access your WSL2 environment from other devices on your local network using port forwarding with `netsh interface portproxy`. Remember to configure a script to keep the port forwarding up-to-date when your WSL2 ip address changes. By making your WSL2 environment accessible, you can leverage the power of Linux development tools and services from any device on your network. Remember to prioritize security and understand the implications of exposing services to your local network.
