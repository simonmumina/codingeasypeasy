# Build a Gatsby Source Plugin for Your Custom CMS: A Comprehensive Guide

Gatsby is a powerful static site generator that allows you to build blazing-fast websites and applications. One of its key features is the ability to source data from various sources, including Content Management Systems (CMS). While Gatsby has excellent support for popular CMS solutions like WordPress, Contentful, and Strapi, you might be using a custom CMS tailored to your specific needs. This is where Gatsby source plugins come in.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of creating a Gatsby source plugin for your custom CMS. We'll cover everything from the initial setup to transforming your CMS data into GraphQL nodes that Gatsby can use to generate your website.

## Why Build a Gatsby Source Plugin?

Using a Gatsby source plugin offers several advantages:

- **Data Decoupling:** It separates your content from your presentation layer, allowing you to easily switch to different frameworks or frontend technologies in the future.
- **Performance Optimization:** Gatsby optimizes your website during the build process, resulting in faster loading times and improved user experience.
- **GraphQL Integration:** Gatsby uses GraphQL to query and manage your data, providing a flexible and efficient way to access content.
- **Developer Experience:** Source plugins streamline the process of fetching data from your CMS, making it easier for developers to work with your content.
- **Centralized Logic:** The plugin encapsulates all the logic for fetching and transforming data, keeping your Gatsby project clean and organized.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:** Gatsby runs on Node.js.
- **Basic knowledge of JavaScript:** Understanding JavaScript fundamentals is essential for building a Gatsby plugin.
- **Familiarity with React:** Gatsby uses React for building user interfaces.
- **Basic understanding of GraphQL:** Gatsby uses GraphQL to query data.
- **Access to your Custom CMS API:** You'll need to be able to retrieve data from your CMS using an API.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Plugin Project

First, create a new directory for your plugin. The naming convention for Gatsby plugins is `gatsby-source-[your-cms-name]`. For example, if your CMS is called "AwesomeCMS," the plugin directory would be `gatsby-source-awesomecms`.

```plaintext
mkdir gatsby-source-awesomecms
cd gatsby-source-awesomecms
npm init -y # or yarn init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file in your plugin directory. Now, install the necessary Gatsby dependency as a `peerDependency` and a `devDependency`:

```plaintext
npm install --save gatsby
npm install --save-dev gatsby
```

**Important:** `gatsby` should be installed as both a peer and dev dependency. The `peerDependency` ensures compatibility with the Gatsby project using your plugin, and the `devDependency` allows you to use Gatsby APIs during plugin development.

Next, create an `index.js` file in your plugin directory. This file will contain the core logic of your plugin.

```plaintext
touch index.js
```

Your project structure should now look like this:

```
gatsby-source-awesomecms/
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

## Step 2: Implementing the `sourceNodes` API

The `sourceNodes` API is the heart of your Gatsby source plugin. It's responsible for fetching data from your CMS and transforming it into nodes that Gatsby can use to generate your site. Open `index.js` and add the following code:

```plaintext
// index.js
const axios = require('axios') // You might need to install axios: npm install axios

exports.sourceNodes = async (
  { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest, reporter },
  configOptions
) => {
  const { createNode } = actions

  // Helper function that processes a "thing" to match Gatsby's node structure
  const processThing = (thing) => {
    const nodeId = createNodeId(`awesomecms-thing-${thing.id}`)
    const nodeContent = JSON.stringify(thing)
    const nodeData = Object.assign({}, thing, {
      id: nodeId,
      parent: null,
      children: [],
      internal: {
        type: `AwesomeCmsThing`,
        content: nodeContent,
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(thing),
      },
    })
    return nodeData
  }

  // Gatsby adds a configOption that's not needed for this plugin, delete it
  delete configOptions.plugins

  const { apiUrl, apiKey } = configOptions

  if (!apiUrl || !apiKey) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild(`gatsby-source-awesomecms requires apiUrl and apiKey options`)
    return // Exit if API URL or API key are missing.
  }

  try {
    reporter.info(`fetching data from AwesomeCMS API: ${apiUrl}`)
    const response = await axios({
      url: apiUrl,
      method: 'get',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      },
    })

    // Process the data into Gatsby nodes.
    response.data.forEach((thing) => {
      const nodeData = processThing(thing)
      createNode(nodeData)
    })

    reporter.success(`Successfully sourced data from AwesomeCMS API`)
  } catch (error) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild(`Error fetching data from AwesomeCMS API: ${error}`)
  }

  return
}
```

Let's break down this code:

- **`axios`:** We use `axios` (you need to install it: `npm install axios`) to make HTTP requests to your CMS API. You can use any other HTTP client you prefer (e.g., `node-fetch`).
- **`exports.sourceNodes`:** This is the main function that Gatsby calls to source data.
- **`{ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest, reporter }`:** These are Gatsby APIs passed to the `sourceNodes` function.
  - `actions`: An object containing functions for creating, updating, and deleting nodes. We use `actions.createNode` to create new nodes.
  - `createNodeId`: A function for generating unique IDs for your nodes. It's important to use a consistent naming scheme to avoid conflicts.
  - `createContentDigest`: A function for generating a hash of the node's content. Gatsby uses this to determine if a node has changed and needs to be updated.
  - `reporter`: An object that provides methods for logging information, warnings, and errors during the build process.
- **`configOptions`:** This object contains the configuration options that the user provides in their `gatsby-config.js` file. We use these options to specify the API URL and API key for your CMS.
- **`processThing(thing)`:** This helper function takes a piece of data from your CMS (in this example, a "thing") and transforms it into a Gatsby node. It creates a unique node ID, generates a content digest, and sets the `internal` properties.
  - **`internal.type`:** This is the most important property of the `internal` object. It defines the GraphQL type for your node. We recommend using a consistent naming scheme, such as `AwesomeCmsThing`. Gatsby will automatically create a GraphQL schema based on this type.
- **Error Handling:** We wrap the API call in a `try...catch` block to handle any errors that may occur. We use the `reporter.panicOnBuild` function to report errors and stop the build process. This is important to prevent your site from building with incomplete or incorrect data.
- **API Request:** We use `axios.get` to make a GET request to your CMS API. You may need to adjust the request based on your CMS API's requirements. For example, you might need to include an API key in the headers or use a different HTTP method.
- **Data Processing:** We iterate over the data returned by your CMS API and call the `processThing` function for each item. This transforms each item into a Gatsby node.
- **`createNode(nodeData)`:** Finally, we call `createNode` to create the node in Gatsby's data layer.

## Step 3: Handling Pagination (If Necessary)

If your CMS API returns a large amount of data, it may be necessary to implement pagination. Here's an example of how to handle pagination:

```plaintext
// index.js (updated)
const axios = require('axios')

exports.sourceNodes = async (
  { actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest, reporter },
  configOptions
) => {
  const { createNode } = actions

  const processThing = (thing) => {
    const nodeId = createNodeId(`awesomecms-thing-${thing.id}`)
    const nodeContent = JSON.stringify(thing)
    const nodeData = Object.assign({}, thing, {
      id: nodeId,
      parent: null,
      children: [],
      internal: {
        type: `AwesomeCmsThing`,
        content: nodeContent,
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(thing),
      },
    })
    return nodeData
  }

  delete configOptions.plugins

  const { apiUrl, apiKey, pageSize = 100 } = configOptions // Default page size

  if (!apiUrl || !apiKey) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild(`gatsby-source-awesomecms requires apiUrl and apiKey options`)
    return
  }

  let page = 1
  let hasNextPage = true

  while (hasNextPage) {
    try {
      reporter.info(`fetching page ${page} from AwesomeCMS API: ${apiUrl}`)
      const response = await axios({
        url: `${apiUrl}?page=${page}&pageSize=${pageSize}`, // Adjust the URL based on your API's pagination requirements
        method: 'get',
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
        },
      })

      const data = response.data

      if (!Array.isArray(data)) {
        reporter.warn(`AwesomeCMS API did not return an array of data on page ${page}.  Stopping.`)
        hasNextPage = false // Stop if the API doesn't return an array.
        break
      }

      // Process the data into Gatsby nodes.
      data.forEach((thing) => {
        const nodeData = processThing(thing)
        createNode(nodeData)
      })

      // Check if there's a next page (adjust based on your API's response)
      if (data.length < pageSize) {
        hasNextPage = false
      } else {
        page++
      }
    } catch (error) {
      reporter.panicOnBuild(`Error fetching page ${page} from AwesomeCMS API: ${error}`)
      hasNextPage = false // Stop fetching on error
    }
  }

  reporter.success(`Successfully sourced data from AwesomeCMS API`)

  return
}
```

Key changes in the pagination example:

- **`pageSize`:** We add a `pageSize` option to the `configOptions` to control the number of items fetched per page. A default value is provided.
- **`while (hasNextPage)`:** We use a `while` loop to iterate over the pages of data.
- **`apiUrl?page=${page}&pageSize=${pageSize}`:** We modify the API URL to include the `page` and `pageSize` parameters. **Adjust this to match your CMS API's pagination scheme.**
- **`data.length < pageSize`:** We check if the number of items returned on the current page is less than the `pageSize`. If it is, we assume that there are no more pages.
- **Error Handling:** The `catch` block now also sets `hasNextPage` to false to prevent infinite loops in case of API errors during pagination. A warning is also logged if the API unexpectedly stops returning an array of data.

## Step 4: Adding Configuration Options

To allow users to configure your plugin, you need to define configuration options in your `gatsby-config.js` file. For example:

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-awesomecms`,
      options: {
        apiUrl: `https://api.awesomecms.com/things`,
        apiKey: `YOUR_API_KEY`,
        pageSize: 50, //Optional, with default in the plugin.
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

As you can see, we're passing the `apiUrl` and `apiKey` as options to the `gatsby-source-awesomecms` plugin. These options will be available in the `configOptions` argument of the `sourceNodes` function. The `pageSize` option is also included and can be customized.

## Step 5: Defining GraphQL Types (Optional but Recommended)

While Gatsby can infer GraphQL types from your data, it's best practice to explicitly define them using the `createSchemaCustomization` API. This provides better type safety and allows you to add custom resolvers.

Create a `gatsby-node.js` file in your plugin directory:

```plaintext
touch gatsby-node.js
```

Add the following code to `gatsby-node.js`:

```plaintext
// gatsby-node.js
exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes } = actions

  const typeDefs = `
    type AwesomeCmsThing implements Node {
      id: ID!
      title: String
      content: String
      createdAt: Date @dateformat
      updatedAt: Date @dateformat
    }
  `

  createTypes(typeDefs)
}
```

Explanation:

- **`exports.createSchemaCustomization`:** This function is called by Gatsby to allow you to customize the GraphQL schema.
- **`{ actions }`:** This is the actions object passed to the function. We use `actions.createTypes` to create new GraphQL types.
- **`typeDefs`:** This is a string containing the GraphQL type definitions.
  - **`AwesomeCmsThing`:** This is the name of the GraphQL type, matching `internal.type` from `index.js`.
  - **`implements Node`:** This indicates that this type is a Gatsby node.
  - **`id: ID!`:** This is the ID field, which is required for all Gatsby nodes. The `!` indicates that it's non-nullable.
  - **`title: String`:** An example field for a title.
  - **`content: String`:** An example field for content.
  - **`createdAt: Date @dateformat` and `updatedAt: Date @dateformat`:** Date fields with the `@dateformat` directive. Gatsby will automatically parse these strings into JavaScript `Date` objects.
- **`createTypes(typeDefs)`:** This creates the GraphQL types in Gatsby's schema.

**Custom Resolvers:** You can also add custom resolvers to your GraphQL types. This allows you to transform data or fetch related data from other sources. For example:

```plaintext
// gatsby-node.js (updated)

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions, schema }) => {
  const { createTypes } = actions

  const typeDefs = `
    type AwesomeCmsThing implements Node {
      id: ID!
      title: String
      content: String
      createdAt: Date @dateformat
      updatedAt: Date @dateformat
      formattedContent: String
    }
  `

  createTypes(typeDefs)
}

exports.createResolvers = ({ createResolvers }) => {
  const resolvers = {
    AwesomeCmsThing: {
      formattedContent: {
        resolve: (source, args, context, info) => {
          // Example: Strip HTML tags from the content
          return source.content.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '')
        },
      },
    },
  }
  createResolvers(resolvers)
}
```

- **`exports.createResolvers`:** This function is called by Gatsby to allow you to create custom resolvers.
- **`resolvers`:** This is an object containing the resolvers for your GraphQL types.
  - **`AwesomeCmsThing`:** This is the name of the GraphQL type.
  - **`formattedContent`:** This is the name of the field that we're resolving.
  - **`resolve`:** This is the resolver function. It takes the source object (the `AwesomeCmsThing` node), the arguments, the context, and the info object as arguments. It returns the resolved value. In this example, it strips HTML tags from the `content` field.

## Step 6: Testing Your Plugin

To test your plugin, you can link it to a local Gatsby project. First, navigate to your plugin directory and run:

```plaintext
npm link # or yarn link
```

Then, navigate to your Gatsby project directory and run:

```plaintext
npm link gatsby-source-awesomecms # or yarn link gatsby-source-awesomecms
```

This will create a symbolic link between your plugin and your Gatsby project. Now, you can add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` file, as shown in Step 4.

Run `gatsby develop` in your Gatsby project to start the development server. You can then use the GraphQL explorer (usually at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`) to query the data from your custom CMS.

You can also use `console.log` statements in your plugin code to debug any issues. Make sure to remove these statements before publishing your plugin.

## Step 7: Publishing Your Plugin

Once you're happy with your plugin, you can publish it to npm. Before publishing, make sure to:

- **Add a README file:** Describe your plugin, how to install it, and how to configure it.
- **Add a LICENSE file:** Choose an open-source license, such as MIT.
- **Update your `package.json` file:** Add a description, keywords, and a repository URL.

Then, run:

```plaintext
npm publish # or yarn publish
```

This will publish your plugin to npm, making it available for others to use.

## Example GraphQL Query

After installing and configuring your plugin in a Gatsby project, you can query your CMS data using GraphQL. Here's an example query:

```plaintext
query {
  allAwesomeCmsThing {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        content
        createdAt
        updatedAt
        formattedContent // If you added the custom resolver
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query will retrieve all `AwesomeCmsThing` nodes and their fields, including the `formattedContent` field if you implemented the custom resolver.

## Conclusion

Building a Gatsby source plugin for your custom CMS allows you to leverage the power of Gatsby to create high-performance websites with your existing content. By following this guide, you can create a plugin that seamlessly integrates your CMS with Gatsby, providing a streamlined and efficient development workflow. Remember to adapt the code examples to match your specific CMS API and data structure. Good luck!
