# MySQL WEEK() Function: Get the Week Number of a Date - Complete Guide with Examples

The MySQL `WEEK()` function is a powerful tool for extracting the week number from a given date. Understanding how to use this function effectively can be invaluable for reporting, data analysis, and various other applications requiring date-based calculations. This guide will provide a comprehensive overview of the `WEEK()` function, exploring its syntax, parameters, different modes, and practical examples.

## Understanding the `WEEK()` Function

The `WEEK()` function in MySQL returns the week number for a given date. It's important to understand that the week number is relative to the year and that different numbering systems exist. MySQL allows you to specify which numbering system to use through its `mode` argument.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of the `WEEK()` function is as follows:

```plaintext
WEEK(date[, mode])
```

Where:

- `date`: The date from which you want to extract the week number. This can be a column containing date values, a date literal, or an expression that evaluates to a date.
- `mode`: (Optional) An integer value that specifies the week numbering system. If omitted, the default mode is 0.

## The `mode` Argument: Specifying the Week Numbering System

The `mode` argument is crucial for controlling how the `WEEK()` function calculates the week number. Different modes produce different results, so choosing the right mode is essential for accuracy. Here's a breakdown of the available modes:

| Mode | Description                                                                   | First Day of Week | First Week of Year                                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Week starts on Sunday. Weeks are numbered from 0-53 (or 0-52 for some years). | Sunday            | The week containing January 1st.                                                   |
| 1    | Week starts on Monday. Weeks are numbered from 0-53 (or 0-52 for some years). | Monday            | The week containing January 1st.                                                   |
| 2    | Week starts on Sunday. Weeks are numbered from 1-53 (or 1-52 for some years). | Sunday            | The week containing January 1st.                                                   |
| 3    | Week starts on Monday. Weeks are numbered from 1-53 (or 1-52 for some years). | Monday            | The week containing January 1st.                                                   |
| 4    | Week starts on Sunday. Weeks are numbered from 0-53 (or 0-52 for some years). | Sunday            | The week containing the year's first Thursday. This follows the ISO 8601 standard. |
| 5    | Week starts on Monday. Weeks are numbered from 0-53 (or 0-52 for some years). | Monday            | The week containing the year's first Thursday. This follows the ISO 8601 standard. |
| 6    | Week starts on Sunday. Weeks are numbered from 1-53 (or 1-52 for some years). | Sunday            | The week containing the year's first Thursday. This follows the ISO 8601 standard. |
| 7    | Week starts on Monday. Weeks are numbered from 1-53 (or 1-52 for some years). | Monday            | The week containing the year's first Thursday. This follows the ISO 8601 standard. |

**Key Considerations for `mode`:**

- **`0` and `1`:** These modes are common for basic week numbering, but they can lead to issues with the first and last few days of the year. A week may begin in one year and end in another.
- **`2` and `3`:** Similar to `0` and `1`, but week numbers start at 1 instead of 0.
- **`4`, `5`, `6`, and `7`:** These modes are compliant with the ISO 8601 standard. The first week of the year is the one that contains the year's first Thursday. This is often the preferred mode for applications requiring consistent week numbering across different systems. Modes `5` and `7` are particularly useful when you need to ensure that weeks always start on a Monday.

## Practical Examples

Let's illustrate the `WEEK()` function with various examples, demonstrating the impact of different `mode` values.

**1. Basic Usage (Default Mode):**

```plaintext
SELECT WEEK('2024-10-27');
-- Output (usually): 43  (depending on your server's default week settings)
```

Without specifying the `mode`, the function uses the default, which is typically mode `0`. This means weeks start on Sunday and are numbered from 0.

**2. Using Mode 1 (Week starts on Monday):**

```plaintext
SELECT WEEK('2024-10-27', 1);
-- Output: 43
```

In this case, the week starts on Monday. Since October 27th, 2024 is a Sunday, the week number is 43.

**3. Using Mode 5 (ISO 8601, Week starts on Monday):**

```plaintext
SELECT WEEK('2024-01-01', 5);
-- Output: 1
SELECT WEEK('2023-12-31', 5);
-- Output: 52

SELECT WEEK('2024-01-02', 5); -- A Tuesday
-- Output: 1
```

This example shows the ISO 8601 compliant mode. Notice how December 31, 2023, is assigned to week 52 of 2023. January 1, 2024, being a Monday, also falls within week 1 of 2024. If January 1 was a Sunday it would fall within the last week of previous year.

**4. Using `WEEK()` with a Date Column:**

Let's assume you have a table named `orders` with a `order_date` column:

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_date, customer_id) VALUES
('2024-01-05', 1),
('2024-01-12', 2),
('2024-03-15', 3),
('2024-10-27', 4);

SELECT order_id, order_date, WEEK(order_date, 5) AS week_number
FROM orders;
```

This query would return:

| order_id | order_date | week_number |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1        | 2024-01-05 | 1           |
| 2        | 2024-01-12 | 2           |
| 3        | 2024-03-15 | 11          |
| 4        | 2024-10-27 | 43          |

**5. Grouping Data by Week:**

You can use the `WEEK()` function to group data by week:

```plaintext
SELECT WEEK(order_date, 5) AS week_number, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY week_number
ORDER BY week_number;
```

This query would count the number of orders placed in each week.

**6. Handling NULL Dates:**

If the `date` argument is NULL, the `WEEK()` function returns NULL:

```plaintext
SELECT WEEK(NULL);
-- Output: NULL
```

**7. Using with `NOW()`:**

```plaintext
SELECT WEEK(NOW(), 5);
-- Output: (The current week number, according to ISO 8601)
```

## Choosing the Right `mode`

Selecting the appropriate `mode` is crucial for data consistency and accuracy. Consider the following factors:

- **Industry standards:** If your application needs to comply with ISO 8601 standards, use modes 4, 5, 6, or 7.
- **Reporting requirements:** Understand how your reporting tools or clients expect week numbers to be calculated.
- **Data consistency:** Ensure that you use the same `mode` consistently throughout your application to avoid discrepancies.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting the `mode` argument:** Relying on the default `mode` without understanding its behavior can lead to incorrect week numbers.
- **Mixing different `mode` values:** Using different `mode` values in different parts of your application will result in inconsistent data.
- **Ignoring the first and last weeks of the year:** Be aware that the first and last weeks of the year can be tricky, especially when using modes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- **Not considering the business context:** The "correct" `mode` depends on the business rules defining how weeks are calculated.

## Conclusion

The MySQL `WEEK()` function is a versatile tool for working with dates and extracting week numbers. By understanding the different `mode` values and their implications, you can effectively use this function for a wide range of applications, from simple reporting to complex data analysis. Remember to choose the `mode` that best suits your specific requirements and maintain consistency throughout your application. Using the ISO 8601 compliant modes (4, 5, 6, or 7) is generally recommended for most applications as it ensures interoperability and consistency. Remember to test thoroughly to ensure you are getting the expected results.
