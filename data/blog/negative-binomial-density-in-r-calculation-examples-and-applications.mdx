# Negative Binomial Density in R: Calculation, Examples, and Applications

The negative binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of trials needed for a fixed number of successes in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success. In R, we can easily calculate the probability mass function (PMF) or density of the negative binomial distribution using the `dnbinom()` function. This blog post will provide a thorough explanation of how to use `dnbinom()`, along with practical examples and its applications in various statistical scenarios.

## Understanding the Negative Binomial Distribution

Before diving into the R code, let's recap the basics of the negative binomial distribution. Unlike the binomial distribution which models the _number of successes_ in a fixed number of trials, the negative binomial distribution models the _number of failures_ before a specified number of _successes_.

Key parameters of the negative binomial distribution are:

- **`size` (or `r`):** The number of successes we want to achieve. This is often referred to as the "stopping point".
- **`prob` (or `p`):** The probability of success on each individual trial.
- **`x`:** The number of failures observed before the `size` number of successes.

The negative binomial distribution is often used as an alternative to the Poisson distribution when data exhibits overdispersion (variance greater than the mean). This makes it a valuable tool in various fields like ecology, epidemiology, and economics.

## The `dnbinom()` Function in R

R's `dnbinom()` function allows us to calculate the probability mass function (PMF) for the negative binomial distribution. Its syntax is as follows:

```plaintext
dnbinom(x, size, prob, mu, log = FALSE)
```

Let's break down each argument:

- **`x`:** The number of failures _before_ the `size` number of successes. This is the value for which you want to calculate the probability. `x` must be a non-negative integer.
- **`size`:** The number of successes to be achieved (the "stopping point"). This must be a positive number.
- **`prob`:** The probability of success on each trial. This must be a number between 0 and 1.
- **`mu`:** An alternative way to parameterize the distribution using the _mean_ (Î¼). If `mu` is provided, `prob` is not used, and `prob` is implicitly derived from `mu` and `size` using the relationship: `prob = size / (size + mu)`. Using `mu` is useful when you have an estimate of the mean directly.
- **`log`:** A logical value. If `TRUE`, the logarithm of the density is returned. Defaults to `FALSE`. Using `log = TRUE` is beneficial when dealing with very small probabilities to avoid underflow issues.

## Practical Examples with Code

Let's illustrate the use of `dnbinom()` with several examples.

**Example 1: Basic Calculation**

Suppose we want to find the probability of observing 5 failures before achieving 3 successes, given that the probability of success on each trial is 0.6.

```plaintext
# Calculate the probability of 5 failures before 3 successes, with p = 0.6
probability <- dnbinom(x = 5, size = 3, prob = 0.6)
print(probability) # Output: 0.11664
```

This code calculates the probability of observing exactly 5 failures before the 3rd success.

**Example 2: Using the `mu` Parameter**

Assume we know the mean of the negative binomial distribution is 8 and the number of successes is 2. Let's calculate the probability of observing 10 failures.

```plaintext
# Calculate the probability using the mean (mu) parameter
probability <- dnbinom(x = 10, size = 2, mu = 8)
print(probability) # Output: 0.04701473
```

R internally converts the `mu` parameter to `prob` using the formula mentioned earlier, ensuring consistency.

**Example 3: Calculating Log Probabilities**

When dealing with very small probabilities, using the log scale can prevent underflow issues.

```plaintext
# Calculate the log probability
log_probability <- dnbinom(x = 50, size = 5, prob = 0.01, log = TRUE)
print(log_probability) # Output: -14.25684
probability = exp(log_probability)
print(probability) # Output: 4.567136e-07
```

Note how using `log = TRUE` returns the logarithm of the probability. You can exponentiate it to get the actual probability, but working directly with the log value is often more numerically stable.

**Example 4: Creating a Probability Distribution Table**

We can generate a table of probabilities for a range of failure values.

```plaintext
# Generate probabilities for failures from 0 to 10
failures <- 0:10
probabilities <- dnbinom(x = failures, size = 4, prob = 0.4)

# Create a data frame
distribution_table <- data.frame(Failures = failures, Probability = probabilities)
print(distribution_table)

# Plot the probability distribution
plot(distribution_table$Failures, distribution_table$Probability,
     type = "h",  # "h" for histogram-like lines
     xlab = "Number of Failures",
     ylab = "Probability",
     main = "Negative Binomial Distribution (size=4, prob=0.4)")
```

This code generates a table showing the probability for each number of failures from 0 to 10. It then plots these probabilities, giving a visual representation of the distribution.

**Example 5: Overdispersion Compared to Poisson**

Let's demonstrate how the negative binomial can handle overdispersion better than the Poisson distribution. Imagine you're counting the number of insects found in a series of traps. Suppose the data exhibits more variability than a Poisson distribution would predict.

```plaintext
# Simulate overdispersed count data
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
counts <- rnbinom(n = 100, size = 2, mu = 5)  # Mean is roughly 5

# Calculate mean and variance of the simulated data
mean_counts <- mean(counts)
var_counts <- var(counts)

print(paste("Mean of counts:", mean_counts)) # Around 5
print(paste("Variance of counts:", var_counts)) # Should be greater than the mean

# Likelihood functions (for demonstration; more sophisticated model fitting would be needed)

loglik_poisson <- function(lambda, data) {
  sum(dpois(data, lambda = lambda, log = TRUE))
}

loglik_negbin <- function(size, mu, data) {
  sum(dnbinom(data, size = size, mu = mu, log = TRUE))
}


# Example likelihood calculation
lambda_est = mean(counts)
size_est = 2
mu_est = mean(counts)

poisson_loglik = loglik_poisson(lambda = lambda_est, data = counts)
negbin_loglik = loglik_negbin(size = size_est, mu = mu_est, data = counts)


print(paste("Poisson Log-Likelihood:", poisson_loglik))
print(paste("Negative Binomial Log-Likelihood:", negbin_loglik))

# In a real analysis, you would maximize these log-likelihoods to find the best parameter estimates.
# However, this example showcases that, in general, the Negative Binomial will likely fit the data better
# if the variance significantly exceeds the mean (overdispersion).  You'd typically use functions like `glm.nb` from the `MASS` package for model fitting.
```

In this example, the variance of the simulated data is greater than its mean, indicating overdispersion. While a proper model fitting exercise using methods like maximum likelihood estimation via functions from the `MASS` package (e.g., `glm.nb`) would be more rigorous, this demonstration shows that the negative binomial distribution can be a more appropriate choice than the Poisson distribution when overdispersion is present. The log-likelihood values should generally reflect this, though model fitting is the proper way to confirm this statistically.

## Applications of the Negative Binomial Distribution

The negative binomial distribution finds applications in various fields:

- **Ecology:** Modeling the distribution of insects, animals, or plants in a given area. It's particularly useful when data exhibits clumped distributions.
- **Epidemiology:** Analyzing the number of disease cases in a population over time, particularly when the assumption of constant risk in the Poisson distribution is violated.
- **Econometrics:** Modeling count data, such as the number of patents filed by a company or the number of accidents at a particular location.
- **Quality Control:** Analyzing the number of defects found in a production process.
- **Actuarial Science:** Modeling the number of claims in insurance portfolios.

## Conclusion

The `dnbinom()` function in R provides a powerful tool for calculating probabilities related to the negative binomial distribution. Understanding its parameters and applications enables statisticians and data scientists to model count data effectively, particularly when dealing with overdispersion. By mastering the techniques outlined in this guide, you'll be well-equipped to leverage the negative binomial distribution in your own statistical analyses. Remember to consider the context of your data and whether the assumptions of the negative binomial distribution (independent trials, constant probability of success) are reasonably met before applying it.
