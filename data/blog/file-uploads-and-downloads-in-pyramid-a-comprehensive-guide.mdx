# File Uploads and Downloads in Pyramid: A Comprehensive Guide

Pyramid is a versatile Python web framework known for its flexibility and adherence to WSGI principles. Handling file uploads and downloads is a common requirement in many web applications, and Pyramid provides the tools you need to implement this functionality efficiently and securely. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process, from setting up your environment to implementing advanced streaming techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python:** Python 3.7 or higher is recommended.
- **Pyramid:** Installed and configured. If you don't have Pyramid, you can install it using `pip install pyramid`.
- **Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):** Use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.

## Setting up your Pyramid Project

If you don't have an existing Pyramid project, create a new one using `pcreate`:

```plaintext
pcreate -s alchemy myproject
cd myproject
python setup.py develop
```

This command creates a Pyramid project named `myproject` using the SQLAlchemy scaffold.

## Basic File Uploads with Form Data

The simplest way to handle file uploads is through standard HTML forms and form data.

**1. Create the HTML Form:**

Create an HTML form in your template (e.g., `templates/mytemplate.pt`) to allow users to select and upload files. Remember to include `enctype="multipart/form-data"` in the `<form>` tag.

```plaintext
<form method="POST" action="/upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <label for="file">Choose file to upload</label>
  <input type="file" id="file" name="file" />
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

**2. Create the View:**

Create a Pyramid view to handle the form submission. This view will extract the uploaded file data from the request.

```plaintext
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.response import Response
import os

@view_config(route_name='upload', renderer='templates/mytemplate.pt', request_method='POST')
def upload_view(request):
    if 'file' in request.POST:
        uploaded_file = request.POST['file']
        filename = uploaded_file.filename
        input_file = uploaded_file.file

        #  Sanitize the filename to prevent security vulnerabilities.
        filename = os.path.basename(filename)

        #  Save the file to a directory (make sure the directory exists).
        save_path = os.path.join('uploads', filename)  #  Create an 'uploads' directory
        with open(save_path, 'wb') as output_file:
            input_file.seek(0)  # Important: Reset the file pointer to the beginning
            output_file.write(input_file.read())

        return {'message': f'File {filename} uploaded successfully!'}
    else:
        return {'message': 'No file uploaded.'}

@view_config(route_name='home', renderer='templates/mytemplate.pt', request_method='GET')
def home_view(request):
    return {}
```

**3. Add Routes:**

Configure the routes in your `__init__.py` (or `main` function) to map the URL paths to the views.

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator

def main(global_config, **settings):
    """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
    """
    with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
        config.include('pyramid_jinja2')
        config.include('.models')
        config.include('.routes')  # If you're using a separate routes.py file
        config.scan()
    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

Create a `routes.py` file (if you don't have one) and add the following routes:

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator

def includeme(config):
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.add_route('upload', '/upload')
```

**4. Create the `uploads` directory:**

Make sure you create the `uploads` directory in the root of your project where the uploaded files will be stored.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Security:** Always sanitize the filename to prevent malicious users from uploading files with harmful names (e.g., with "../" to overwrite system files). `os.path.basename()` is a good starting point, but you might need more robust sanitization.
- **File Size Limits:** Implement file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks. You can configure this in your web server (e.g., nginx, Apache) or in your Pyramid application using middleware.
- **Storage:** Consider storing uploaded files in a more scalable and reliable storage solution like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, especially for larger applications.
- **Error Handling:** Add proper error handling to catch exceptions during file processing.

## File Downloads

Serving files for download is another common task. Here's how you can implement it in Pyramid.

**1. Create the View:**

Create a view that retrieves the file and returns it as a `Response` object with the appropriate headers.

```plaintext
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.response import FileResponse
import os

@view_config(route_name='download', renderer='json')
def download_view(request):
    filename = request.matchdict['filename']
    filepath = os.path.join('uploads', filename)

    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        return {'error': 'File not found'}

    response = FileResponse(
        filepath,
        request=request,
        content_type='application/octet-stream' # or appropriate mime type
    )
    response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment;filename="{filename}"'
    return response
```

**2. Add the Route:**

Add a route to your `routes.py` file:

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator

def includeme(config):
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.add_route('upload', '/upload')
    config.add_route('download', '/download/{filename}')
```

**3. Link to the Download:**

In your templates or views, create a link to the download URL:

```plaintext
<a href="/download/my_uploaded_file.txt">Download File</a>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`FileResponse`:** This class automatically handles streaming the file content to the client, improving performance for larger files.
- **`content_type`:** Set the appropriate MIME type for the file being downloaded. `application/octet-stream` forces the browser to download the file, regardless of its content.
- **`Content-Disposition`:** This header tells the browser how to handle the response. `attachment` indicates that the file should be downloaded, and `filename` suggests a filename for the downloaded file.
- **Error Handling:** Check if the file exists before attempting to serve it.

## Advanced Techniques: Streaming Large Files

For very large files, loading the entire file into memory can be inefficient and cause performance problems. Pyramid allows you to stream files directly from disk, which is more memory-efficient.

```plaintext
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.response import Response
import os

@view_config(route_name='stream_download', renderer='json')
def stream_download_view(request):
    filename = request.matchdict['filename']
    filepath = os.path.join('uploads', filename)

    if not os.path.isfile(filepath):
        return {'error': 'File not found'}

    def file_iterator(filepath, chunk_size=4096):
        with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
            while True:
                chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                yield chunk

    response = Response(
        app_iter=file_iterator(filepath),  # Use the iterator for the file content
        content_type='application/octet-stream'
    )
    response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment;filename="{filename}"'
    return response
```

**Explanation:**

- **`file_iterator`:** This function opens the file in binary mode (`'rb'`) and reads it in chunks. It yields each chunk as it's read.
- **`app_iter`:** The `Response` object is initialized with the `file_iterator` as its `app_iter`. This tells Pyramid to stream the data from the iterator to the client.
- **Chunk Size:** The `chunk_size` parameter controls how much data is read and sent in each chunk. A larger chunk size can improve performance but might consume more memory. Experiment to find the optimal value for your application.

**Add the route to `routes.py`:**

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator

def includeme(config):
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.add_route('upload', '/upload')
    config.add_route('download', '/download/{filename}')
    config.add_route('stream_download', '/stream_download/{filename}')
```

## Using Blob Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage)

For production applications, storing files directly on the web server is generally not recommended. Blob storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage offer better scalability, reliability, and security.

Here's a simplified example using `boto3` (for AWS S3). You'll need to install `boto3`: `pip install boto3`. You'll also need to configure your AWS credentials.

```plaintext
import boto3
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.response import Response
import os

S3_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-s3-bucket-name'  # Replace with your bucket name

@view_config(route_name='s3_upload', renderer='templates/mytemplate.pt', request_method='POST')
def s3_upload_view(request):
    if 'file' in request.POST:
        uploaded_file = request.POST['file']
        filename = uploaded_file.filename
        input_file = uploaded_file.file

        s3 = boto3.client('s3')

        try:
            s3.upload_fileobj(
                input_file,
                S3_BUCKET_NAME,
                filename
            )
            return {'message': f'File {filename} uploaded to S3 successfully!'}
        except Exception as e:
            return {'message': f'Error uploading to S3: {str(e)}'}
    else:
        return {'message': 'No file uploaded.'}


@view_config(route_name='s3_download', renderer='json')
def s3_download_view(request):
    filename = request.matchdict['filename']

    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    try:
        obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=S3_BUCKET_NAME, Key=filename)
        file_content = obj['Body'].read()

        response = Response(
            body=file_content,
            content_type='application/octet-stream'
        )
        response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment;filename="{filename}"'
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        return {'error': f'Error downloading from S3: {str(e)}'}
```

**Add the routes to `routes.py`:**

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator

def includeme(config):
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.add_route('upload', '/upload')
    config.add_route('download', '/download/{filename}')
    config.add_route('stream_download', '/stream_download/{filename}')
    config.add_route('s3_upload', '/s3_upload')
    config.add_route('s3_download', '/s3_download/{filename}')
```

**Key Points:**

- **Configuration:** Store your AWS credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables or AWS IAM roles).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions related to S3 operations.
- **Permissions:** Configure your S3 bucket permissions appropriately to control who can upload and download files.
- **Scalability:** Blob storage services are designed for massive scalability and can handle a large number of files and requests.
- **Other Blob Storage Providers:** The principles are the same for other providers like Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage; you just need to use the appropriate client libraries (e.g., `google-cloud-storage`, `azure-storage-blob`).

## Security Best Practices

- **Input Validation:** Always validate user input, including filenames and file sizes.
- **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize filenames to prevent directory traversal attacks and other vulnerabilities. `os.path.basename()` is a minimum requirement, but you might need more robust sanitization based on your application's needs.
- **File Size Limits:** Enforce file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- **Content-Type Validation:** Verify the file's content type to prevent users from uploading malicious files with misleading extensions. Use libraries like `python-magic` to determine the actual file type.
- **Storage Security:** Securely store uploaded files using appropriate permissions and access controls. Use blob storage services for production applications.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit between the client and the server.

## Conclusion

Handling file uploads and downloads in Pyramid can be achieved with various techniques, from basic form handling to advanced streaming and blob storage integration. By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your Pyramid applications handle files efficiently, securely, and reliably. Remember to prioritize security and scalability as your application grows. Experiment with different approaches to find the best solution for your specific needs.
