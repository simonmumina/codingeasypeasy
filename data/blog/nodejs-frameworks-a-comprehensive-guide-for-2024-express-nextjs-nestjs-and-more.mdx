**Example:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

**Pros:**

*   **Flexibility:**  Ideal for projects where you need complete control over the architecture.
*   **Easy to Learn:**  Simple and straightforward API makes it easy for beginners to get started.

*   Creating simple web servers

## Next.js: Server-Side Rendering and Full-Stack Capabilities

Next.js is a React framework that excels at building server-rendered and statically generated websites. It provides a seamless development experience and optimizes for performance and SEO.

**Key Features:**

*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**  Improves SEO and initial page load time by rendering pages on the server.
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):**  Generates static HTML files at build time for faster performance and reduced server load.
*   **Automatic Code Splitting:**  Splits your code into smaller chunks for optimized loading.
*   **Built-in Routing:**  Provides a file-system-based routing system.
*   **API Routes:**  Allows you to create serverless API endpoints within your Next.js application.
*   **Image Optimization:** Built in components for optimized image delivery.
*   **TypeScript Support:** First class TypeScript support.

**Example:**

Create a basic `pages/index.js` file:

```javascript
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
      <p>This page is server-rendered.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

**Pros:**

*   **Improved SEO:**  SSR and SSG make your website more search engine friendly.
*   **Excellent Performance:**  Optimized for speed and efficiency.
