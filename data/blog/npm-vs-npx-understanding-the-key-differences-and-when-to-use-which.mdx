# npm vs npx: Understanding the Key Differences and When to Use Which

Node.js developers often encounter `npm` and `npx`, two command-line tools that play crucial roles in managing packages and executing binaries. While both are related and often used together, they serve distinct purposes. Understanding their differences is essential for efficient and effective Node.js development. This comprehensive guide will explore the core differences between `npm` and `npx`, providing practical examples to illustrate their usage and help you determine when to use which command.

## What is npm?

`npm` (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It comes bundled with Node.js and is responsible for:

- **Installing and managing dependencies:** `npm` allows you to install, update, and uninstall packages and their dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.
- **Running scripts:** You can define custom scripts in your `package.json` file and execute them using `npm run <script-name>`.
- **Publishing packages:** `npm` provides a platform for sharing your own Node.js packages with the community.

**How `npm` works:**

When you install a package using `npm install <package-name>`, it downloads the package and its dependencies into the `node_modules` directory within your project. These packages are then available for use in your code. `npm` also updates the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files to reflect the changes in your project's dependencies.

**Example:**

To install the popular `lodash` library, you would use the following command:

```plaintext
npm install lodash
```

This will install `lodash` into your `node_modules` directory and update your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

## What is npx?

`npx` (Node Package eXecutor) is a tool that comes with `npm` (since npm version 5.2.0). It's designed to execute Node.js packages without globally installing them. It's particularly useful for running command-line tools that are not installed globally or for running different versions of the same tool without conflicts.

**Key features of `npx`:**

- **Executes packages without global installation:** `npx` can download and run a package on-the-fly without requiring you to install it globally using `npm install -g`.
- **Runs local binaries:** If a package is already installed locally in your `node_modules` directory, `npx` will prioritize using that local version.
- **Clears cache after execution:** By default, `npx` clears the downloaded package from the cache after it's executed, saving disk space.
- **Allows specifying package version:** You can specify a specific version of a package to execute.

**How `npx` works:**

When you run a command with `npx <package-name>`, `npx` first checks if the package is installed locally in your `node_modules` directory. If it is, it executes the local version. If not, it downloads the package from the npm registry into a temporary cache, executes it, and then (by default) clears the cache.

**Example:**

To run the `create-react-app` command-line tool without installing it globally, you can use:

```plaintext
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

This will download `create-react-app` (if it's not already in the cache), execute it to create a new React application named `my-react-app`, and then (usually) clear the downloaded files.

## Key Differences: npm vs npx

| Feature                 | npm                                                           | npx                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**             | Package management and script execution                       | Package execution without global installation                            |
| **Installation**        | Bundled with Node.js                                          | Bundled with npm (>= 5.2.0)                                              |
| **Package Handling**    | Installs packages into `node_modules`                         | Executes packages directly from the npm registry or local `node_modules` |
| **Global Installation** | Typically requires global installation for command-line tools | Avoids global installation of packages                                   |
| **Version Management**  | Relies on project dependencies in `package.json`              | Allows specifying package versions directly in the command line          |

## When to Use npm

- **Installing Project Dependencies:** Use `npm install` to install packages required by your project. These packages are typically listed in your `package.json` file.
- **Updating Packages:** Use `npm update` to update your project's dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
- **Running Scripts Defined in `package.json`:** Use `npm run <script-name>` to execute custom scripts defined in your `package.json` file, such as build scripts, test scripts, or development server scripts.
- **Publishing Packages to npm Registry:** If you want to share your own Node.js packages with the community, you'll use `npm publish`.

**Example: Using npm for script execution**

In your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^26.6.3"
  }
}
```

You can run the server using:

```plaintext
npm start
```

And run your tests using:

```plaintext
npm test
```

## When to Use npx

- **Running Command-Line Tools Without Global Installation:** Use `npx` to run command-line tools like `create-react-app`, `vue-cli`, or `gatsby-cli` without installing them globally. This helps keep your global environment clean and prevents version conflicts.
- **Testing Different Versions of a Package:** You can use `npx` to quickly test a specific version of a package without affecting your project's dependencies. For example: `npx react@16.0.0`. However it may not work as intended and you should also specify the command to run within that package.
- **Executing One-Off Commands:** Use `npx` for executing commands that you only need to run occasionally.
- **Avoiding Global Package Pollution:** `npx` is the preferred way to use commands that are typically installed globally. For example, if you have multiple projects that use different versions of `webpack`, using `npx webpack` will run the version local to the project (if installed) or download a temporary copy instead of relying on a globally installed (and potentially outdated) version.

**Example: Using npx to run a specific version of a package**

```plaintext
npx eslint@7.0.0 .
```

This will run ESLint version 7.0.0 on your current directory, even if you have a different version installed globally or in your project's `node_modules`.

## Best Practices

- **Prefer `npx` for running command-line tools:** Unless you have a specific reason to install a tool globally, use `npx` to avoid potential conflicts and keep your global environment clean.
- **Use `npm` for managing project dependencies:** `npm` is the go-to tool for installing, updating, and managing the packages required by your project.
- **Combine `npm` scripts with `npx`:** You can use `npx` within your `npm` scripts to execute command-line tools. This allows you to leverage the benefits of both tools.

**Example: Combining npm scripts and npx**

In your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "format": "npx prettier --write ."
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "^2.2.1"
  }
}
```

Now you can run:

```plaintext
npm run format
```

This will execute the `prettier` command using `npx`, formatting your code according to your `prettier` configuration. The advantage is that `prettier` doesn't need to be installed globally.

## Conclusion

`npm` and `npx` are powerful tools that complement each other in the Node.js ecosystem. `npm` is your package manager for installing and managing project dependencies and running scripts. `npx` is your package executor for running command-line tools without global installation and managing different versions. Understanding their differences and following best practices will help you streamline your development workflow, avoid common pitfalls, and write cleaner, more maintainable code. By using these tools effectively, you can become a more efficient and productive Node.js developer.
