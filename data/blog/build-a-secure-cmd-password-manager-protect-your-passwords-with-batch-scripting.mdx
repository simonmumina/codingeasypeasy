# Build a Secure CMD Password Manager: Protect Your Passwords with Batch Scripting

Are you looking for a secure and customizable way to manage your passwords directly from the command line? This blog post will guide you through the process of creating your own CMD-based password manager using batch scripting. While not as feature-rich as dedicated password manager applications, this project provides a valuable learning experience in scripting, security principles, and offers a degree of control and portability that commercial solutions may not.

**Disclaimer:** Batch scripting has inherent limitations. This method is suitable for personal use and educational purposes. For sensitive data, consider using dedicated and professionally audited password management tools. The security of this system relies heavily on the strength of your master password and the security of your system.

## Why Build a CMD Password Manager?

- **Control:** You have complete control over how your passwords are stored and managed.
- **Customization:** Tailor the script to your specific needs and preferences.
- **Learning:** Gain practical experience with batch scripting, encryption techniques, and command-line tools.
- **Portability:** The script can be easily copied and run on any Windows machine.
- **Simplicity:** A lightweight alternative to complex password management software.

## Project Overview: Features and Functionality

Our CMD password manager will include the following key features:

- **Secure Storage:** Passwords are encrypted before being stored in a plain text file.
- **Encryption/Decryption:** Utilizing a simple XOR-based encryption (for demonstration purposes only. See Security Considerations).
- **Password Retrieval:** Ability to retrieve passwords based on a service/website identifier.
- **Password Addition:** Adding new passwords to the password database.
- **Password Updating:** Modify existing passwords.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** (As user-friendly as CMD allows!).

## Prerequisites

- A Windows operating system (7 or later recommended).
- Basic understanding of the command prompt (CMD).
- Text editor (Notepad is sufficient).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create the Password Database File

First, create a plain text file named `passwords.txt` in a secure location on your computer. This file will store your encrypted passwords.

**Important:** Choose a location that is not easily accessible and has proper file permissions set. Ideally, encrypt the entire folder containing the `passwords.txt` file using Windows' built-in encryption features or a third-party encryption tool.

### 2. Create the Batch Script

Open a text editor (like Notepad) and paste the following code into it. Save the file as `password_manager.bat`.

```plaintext
@echo off
title CMD Password Manager

:mainMenu
cls
echo ===================================
echo       CMD Password Manager

  call :decrypt "%%b" "%masterKey%" decryptedPassword
  if "%serviceName%"=="%service%" (
    echo.
    echo Service: %serviceName%
    echo Password: %decryptedPassword%
    echo.
  )
)

if not defined decryptedPassword (
    echo Service not found.
)

pause
goto mainMenu

:updatePassword

echo          Update Password
echo ===================================
echo.
set /p service="Enter the service/website to update: "
set /p newPassword="Enter the new password: "
set /p masterKey="Enter your master password: "

call :encrypt "%service%:%newPassword%" "%masterKey%" encryptedNewPassword

(for /f "tokens=1* delims=:" %%a in ('type passwords.txt') do (
    set "line=%%a:%%b"
    for /f "tokens=1 delims=:" %%c in ("%%a") do (
        if /i "%%c"=="%service%" (
            echo %service%:%encryptedNewPassword%
        ) else (
            echo %%a:%%b
        )
    )
)) > temp.txt

move /y temp.txt passwords.txt >nul

echo Password updated successfully!
pause
goto mainMenu

:encrypt
setlocal
set "plaintext=%~1"
set "key=%~2"
set "encrypted="

:encryptLoop
if not defined plaintext (
    endlocal & set "%~3=%encrypted%"
    exit /b
)

set "char=%plaintext:~0,1%"
set "keyChar=%key:~0,1%"

set /a "charCode=%char%"
set /a "keyCharCode=%keyChar%"

set /a "xorCode=charCode^keyCharCode"
set "xorChar="
for /l %%i in (0,1,255) do (
    if %%i equ %xorCode% set "xorChar=!asc[%%i]!"
)
if not defined xorChar set "xorChar=!"

set "encrypted=%encrypted%!xorChar!"
set "plaintext=%plaintext:~1%"

    cmd /v:on /c "exit !%%i!"
    set "asc[%%i]=!errorlevel!"
  )
)>nul 2>&1
goto mainMenu
```

### 3. Understanding the Code

- **`@echo off`:** Disables command echoing.
- **`title CMD Password Manager`:** Sets the title of the command prompt window.
- **`:mainMenu`:** Defines the main menu label.
- **`cls`:** Clears the screen.
- **`echo`:** Displays text on the console.
- **`set /p`:** Prompts the user for input and stores it in a variable.
- **`if %choice%==1 goto addPassword`:** Conditional branching based on user input.
- **`:addPassword`, `:retrievePassword`, `:updatePassword`:** Labels for different sections of the script.
- **`type passwords.txt`:** Reads the contents of the password file.
- **`findstr /b "%service%:"`:** Searches for lines starting with the specified service.
- **`for /f "tokens=1* delims=:" %%a in (...)`:** Parses the lines from the password file, separating the service and the encrypted password.
- **`:encrypt` and `:decrypt` subroutines:** Performs the encryption and decryption using a simple XOR cipher.
- **`endlocal & set "%~3=%encrypted%"` and `endlocal & set "%~3=%decrypted%"`:** Used to return the encrypted/decrypted value from the subroutine.

### 4. Run the Script

Double-click the `password_manager.bat` file. The command prompt will open with the main menu.

### 5. Using the Password Manager

- **Add Password (Option 1):**
  - Enter the service/website (e.g., `Gmail`).
  - Enter the password.
  - Enter your **master password**. **This is crucial! Do not lose it!**
- **Retrieve Password (Option 2):**
  - Enter the service/website.
  - Enter your **master password**.
- **Update Password (Option 3):**
  - Enter the service/website you want to update.
  - Enter the new password.
  - Enter your **master password**.

### 6. Explanation of the Encryption/Decryption

The provided script utilizes a simple XOR (exclusive OR) cipher for encryption and decryption. Here's how it works:

1.  **XOR Operation:** The XOR operation compares two bits. If the bits are different, the result is 1; if they are the same, the result is 0.
2.  **Encryption:** Each character of the plaintext password is XORed with a character from the master password. The master password is repeated if it's shorter than the plaintext password. The result is the ciphertext.
3.  **Decryption:** Each character of the ciphertext is XORed with the _same_ character from the master password used for encryption. This reverses the encryption process, recovering the original plaintext password.

**Important Note:** The provided XOR encryption is extremely basic and vulnerable to various attacks. It's **not suitable for storing highly sensitive information**. Consider these limitations and explore stronger encryption methods if you intend to use this for anything beyond simple experimentation. Specifically, this code uses ASCII characters, but makes no attempt to handle non-printable or special characters which can create issues in a batch context.

### 7. Security Considerations and Improvements

- **Master Password Security:** The security of your passwords depends entirely on the strength and secrecy of your master password. Choose a long, complex, and unique password. Store it securely (ideally, memorized and not written down).
- **Encryption Strength:** The XOR cipher is easily broken. **Do not rely on it for strong security.** Consider using more robust encryption algorithms, such as AES or ChaCha20, which can be implemented using external tools or more advanced scripting techniques (e.g., PowerShell integration). However, using PowerShell will greatly reduce the "pure CMD" aspect of the script.
- **Storage Security:** The `passwords.txt` file is stored in plain text (albeit with encrypted passwords). Encrypt the entire file or the folder containing it using Windows' built-in encryption or a third-party encryption tool.
- **Key Derivation:** Instead of directly using the master password as the encryption key, use a key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2 or bcrypt to generate a stronger key from the master password. This makes it more resistant to brute-force attacks. However, implementing this in pure CMD is incredibly challenging and likely impractical.
- **Salt:** Use a unique salt for each password entry. A salt is a random value that is combined with the password before hashing or encryption. This prevents rainbow table attacks. Again, the complexity of implementing this in pure CMD is significant.
- **Input Validation:** Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks. Sanitize user input before using it in commands. For example, restrict the characters allowed in the service name and password. This is important because the script uses `findstr` and other commands that could be exploited with malicious input.
- **Secure Deletion:** When updating passwords, ensure the old passwords are securely deleted from the `passwords.txt` file (overwritten multiple times) to prevent recovery. This is difficult to achieve reliably with batch scripts. The current script only overwrites entries, it doesn't securely delete the old entries from a security standpoint.
- **Error Handling:** Add error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as file access errors or invalid input.
- **Consider PowerShell:** While this guide focuses on CMD, PowerShell offers more advanced scripting capabilities and security features. Consider migrating your password manager to PowerShell for improved security and functionality.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** While extremely difficult to implement directly in a batch script, consider using external tools that support 2FA to add an extra layer of security.
- **Password Complexity Requirements:** Implement checks to enforce password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) when adding or updating passwords.

### 8. Code Improvements

The provided script can be improved in several ways:

- **More Robust Encryption:** Replace the XOR cipher with a stronger encryption algorithm. The complexity here quickly escalates beyond what is easily achievable in pure CMD.
- **Parameter Validation:** Validate user input to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities.
- **Clearer Error Messages:** Provide more informative error messages to the user.
- **Modular Design:** Break the script into smaller, more manageable functions to improve readability and maintainability.

### 9. Conclusion

This guide provides a foundation for building your own CMD-based password manager. While it has limitations, it's a great learning project for understanding scripting, security principles, and command-line tools. Remember to prioritize security by using a strong master password, considering stronger encryption methods, and implementing appropriate security measures.

**Disclaimer:** This is a simplified example and should not be used for storing highly sensitive information without significant security enhancements. Always prioritize security when handling passwords and other sensitive data. Use dedicated and professionally audited password management tools for critical data protection.

Happy scripting!
