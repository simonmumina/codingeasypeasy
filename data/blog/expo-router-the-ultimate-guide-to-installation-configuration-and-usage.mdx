# Expo Router: The Ultimate Guide to Installation, Configuration, and Usage

Expo Router has revolutionized navigation in React Native development, offering a file-based routing system similar to Next.js for the web, but optimized for mobile and universal apps. This blog post will guide you through the installation, configuration, and usage of Expo Router, empowering you to build intuitive and performant navigation experiences in your Expo projects.

## What is Expo Router?

Expo Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React Navigation. It leverages a file-based routing system, meaning your app's navigation structure is determined by the directory and file structure within your project. This approach provides several benefits:

*   **Intuitive and Declarative:** Defining routes is as simple as creating files and folders.
*   **Deep Linking Support:** Automatic deep linking integration streamlines user journeys from external sources.
*   **Type Safety:** Encourages a structured codebase, promoting maintainability and reducing errors.
*   **Universal Apps:** Designed for creating apps that can run seamlessly on both web and native platforms.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Built on top of React Navigation, ensuring efficient transitions and resource management.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the installation process, ensure you have the following:

*   **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 16 or later is recommended).
*   **npm or Yarn:** Choose your preferred package manager (npm or Yarn).
*   **Expo CLI:** Install the Expo CLI globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    # or
    yarn global add expo-cli
    ```
*   **An Expo Project:**  Either create a new Expo project or use an existing one.

## Installation

There are two main ways to add Expo Router to your project: by creating a new project with Expo Router already configured or adding it to an existing Expo project.

### Method 1: Creating a New Project with Expo Router

This is the simplest approach for starting a new project with Expo Router pre-configured.

1.  **Create a new Expo project using the `tabs` template:**

    ```bash
    npx create-expo-app --template tabs
    # or
    yarn create expo-app --template tabs
    ```

2.  **Choose a name for your project:**  Follow the prompts to select a name and options for your project.

3.  **Navigate to your project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <your-project-name>
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

This will launch the Expo development server, allowing you to preview your app on a simulator, emulator, or physical device.  The `tabs` template comes pre-configured with Expo Router and a basic tab navigation structure.

### Method 2: Adding Expo Router to an Existing Expo Project

If you already have an Expo project, follow these steps to integrate Expo Router:

1.  **Install Expo Router and its dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar
    # or
    yarn add expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar
    ```

    These packages are essential for Expo Router to function correctly.

2.  **Modify `metro.config.js` (or create it if it doesn't exist):**

    In your project's root directory, you'll need to adjust the Metro bundler configuration. Create a `metro.config.js` file (if you don't have one already) and add the following:

    ```javascript
    // Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
    const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

    /** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
    const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname, {
      // [Web-only]: Enables CSS support.
      isCSSEnabled: true,
    });

    module.exports = config;
    ```

    This ensures Metro is configured correctly for Expo.

3.  **Create an `app` directory:**

    Create a directory named `app` in the root of your project. This is where you will define your routes.  Any files placed within this directory automatically become routes in your application.

4.  **Modify `app.json`:**

    Add `"scheme"` to your `app.json` file. Replace `your-app-name` with your app's actual name. This is crucial for deep linking.

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "Your App Name",
        "slug": "your-app-name",
        "scheme": "your-app-name",
        // ... other configurations
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Update `index.js`:**

    Replace the content of `index.js` (or `index.ts` if you're using TypeScript) with the following:

    ```javascript
    import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
    import App from './app'; // Import your app directory

    // registerRootComponent calls AppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => App);
    // It also ensures that whether you load the app in Expo Go or in a native build,
    // the environment is set up appropriately
    registerRootComponent(App);
    ```

    This ensures your app is properly registered with Expo.

6.  **Create a sample route (e.g., `app/index.js` or `app/index.tsx`):**

    Inside the `app` directory, create a file named `index.js` (or `index.tsx` for TypeScript). This will serve as the root route ( `/` ) of your application.

    ```javascript
    // app/index.js
    import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, Expo Router!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
      },
      text: {
        fontSize: 20,
        fontWeight: 'bold',
      },
    });
    ```

7.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    You should now see "Hello, Expo Router!" displayed on your device or emulator.

## Basic Routing

Expo Router uses a file-based routing system.  Here's how it works:

*   **`app/index.js` (or `app/index.tsx`):**  This file represents the root route (`/`).
*   **`app/about.js` (or `app/about.tsx`):**  This file represents the `/about` route.
*   **`app/users/[id].js` (or `app/users/[id].tsx`):**  This file represents a dynamic route where `[id]` is a parameter (e.g., `/users/1`, `/users/2`).

### Navigation with `Link`

The `<Link>` component is the primary way to navigate between routes in Expo Router.

```javascript
import { Link } from 'expo-router';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Link href="/about">
        <Text>Go to About</Text>
      </Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

This code creates a link that, when pressed, navigates the user to the `/about` route.

### Navigating Programmatically with `useRouter`

For more complex navigation scenarios, such as navigating after an API call or based on certain conditions, you can use the `useRouter` hook.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleGoToAbout = () => {
    router.push('/about'); // Navigate to the /about route
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button title="Go to About" onPress={handleGoToAbout} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

The `router.push()` function allows you to programmatically navigate to a specified route.  Other methods available on the `router` object include:

*   `router.replace(href)`:  Replaces the current route in the history stack, preventing the user from going back.
*   `router.back()`: Navigates back to the previous route.
*   `router.forward()`:  Navigates forward to the next route (if available).

### Accessing Route Parameters with `useLocalSearchParams`

For dynamic routes like `app/users/[id].js`, you can access the route parameters using the `useLocalSearchParams` hook.

```javascript
// app/users/[id].js
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function UserDetails() {
  const { id } = useLocalSearchParams();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>User ID: {id}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this example, if the user navigates to `/users/123`, the `id` variable will contain the value "123".

## Advanced Routing Techniques

Expo Router offers several advanced routing techniques for building sophisticated navigation structures.

### Group Routes (`_layout.js`)

Group routes allow you to organize your routes into logical groups without affecting the URL structure.  You can define a `_layout.js` file within a directory to create a layout that applies to all routes within that directory.

For example:

```
app/
  (auth)/       // Group Route (doesn't appear in URL)
    _layout.js  // Layout for auth routes (e.g. authentication context)
    login.js   // /login
    register.js  // /register
  home.js      // /home
  about.js     // /about
```

In this example, both `/login` and `/register` will be wrapped in the layout defined in `app/(auth)/_layout.js`.  The `(auth)` part of the directory name is ignored in the URL.

A typical `_layout.js` file might look like this:

```javascript
// app/(auth)/_layout.js
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import { AuthProvider } from '../context/AuthContext'; // Assuming you have an AuthContext

export default function AuthLayout() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <Stack>
        {/* Define common screen options for auth routes here */}
      </Stack>
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```

### Stack Navigator (`Stack`)

The `Stack` navigator provides a familiar stack-based navigation experience, allowing users to push and pop screens.  You can define a `Stack` navigator within a `_layout.js` file.

```javascript
// app/_layout.js
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen name="index" options={{ title: 'Home' }} />  // / (root route)
      <Stack.Screen name="about" options={{ title: 'About' }} /> // /about
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

### Tabs Navigator (`Tabs`)

The `Tabs` navigator allows you to create tab-based navigation, commonly used in mobile applications.  Similar to the `Stack` navigator, you can define a `Tabs` navigator within a `_layout.js` file.

```javascript
// app/_layout.js
import { Tabs } from 'expo-router';

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="index"
        options={{
          tabBarLabel: 'Home',
          title: 'Home',
        }}
      />
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="settings"
        options={{
          tabBarLabel: 'Settings',
          title: 'Settings'
        }}
      />
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

Each `Tabs.Screen` component defines a tab and its associated route.

### Bottom Tabs Navigator

To achieve a standard bottom tab navigation experience, you would typically use the `Tabs` navigator within your root layout (`app/_layout.js`). The example above shows a basic tabs configuration.

### Universal Links and Deep Linking

Expo Router simplifies handling universal links and deep linking.  By configuring the `"scheme"` in your `app.json` file, Expo Router automatically handles incoming links and routes the user to the appropriate screen in your app.

## Best Practices

*   **Organize your `app` directory logically:** Group related routes into directories.
*   **Use `_layout.js` files to define common layouts:**  Avoid repeating layout code across multiple screens.
*   **Leverage the `useLocalSearchParams` hook to access route parameters:**  Easily retrieve data from dynamic routes.
*   **Keep your routes simple and focused:** Break down complex screens into smaller, reusable components.
*   **Test your navigation thoroughly on both web and native platforms:**  Ensure a consistent user experience.
*   **Use TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability:**  This is highly recommended for larger projects.
*   **Take advantage of Expo's built-in features like OTA updates:**  Streamline your development and deployment workflow.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Routes not working:**  Double-check your file structure and ensure that your files are correctly placed within the `app` directory.
*   **Deep linking issues:**  Verify that the `"scheme"` in your `app.json` is correct and that your device/emulator is properly configured for deep linking.
*   **Metro bundler errors:**  Ensure that your `metro.config.js` file is correctly configured for Expo Router. If using TypeScript, make sure all necessary types are installed.
*   **Navigation issues:**  Check your navigation logic and ensure that you are using the `Link` component or `useRouter` hook correctly.
*   **"Can't find variable: require" error:**  This can happen sometimes if Expo hasn't fully initialized. Try restarting the Expo development server (stopping it with Ctrl+C and then `npm start` or `yarn start` again).
