# How to Check if a Variable or Function is Defined in JavaScript (and TypeScript)

Ensuring that a variable or function is defined before using it is crucial for writing robust and error-free JavaScript and TypeScript code.  Accessing an undefined variable will result in a `ReferenceError`, halting the execution of your script.  This post will explore various methods to safely check for the existence of variables and functions, along with examples and best practices.

## Why Check if a Variable or Function is Defined?

Before diving into the "how," let's understand the "why."  Consider these common scenarios:

*   **Conditional Logic:**  You might want to execute a certain piece of code only if a specific configuration variable is present.
*   **Optional Dependencies:**  Your code might rely on an external library or module that isn't always available.
*   **User-Defined Functions:**  You might want to use a function that's optionally defined by the user.
*   **Handling Legacy Code:** When working with older codebases, you might encounter variables that are inconsistently defined.
*   **Module Federation:** Dynamically loading modules can cause dependencies to be unavailable.

## Methods for Checking if a Variable is Defined in JavaScript

### 1.  The `typeof` Operator

The `typeof` operator is the most common and generally recommended way to check if a variable is defined. It returns a string indicating the data type of the operand or "undefined" if the variable hasn't been declared.  Crucially, using `typeof` *before* the variable has been declared doesn't throw a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
let myVariable; // Declared but not assigned

console.log(typeof myVariable); // Output: "undefined"

if (typeof myVariable !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('myVariable is defined!');
} else {
  console.log('myVariable is undefined.'); // This will be printed.
}

// Undefined variable (not even declared)
// console.log(notDeclaredVariable); // This would cause a ReferenceError without a check.

if (typeof notDeclaredVariable !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('notDeclaredVariable is defined!');
} else {
  console.log('notDeclaredVariable is undefined.'); // This will be printed.
}
```

**Important Considerations with `typeof`:**

*   `typeof` returns `"undefined"` for both undeclared variables and variables that have been declared but not assigned a value (i.e., they are explicitly set to `undefined` or declared without an initial value).
*   It's crucial to compare the result of `typeof` with the string `"undefined"` (in quotes).  Using the undefined variable `undefined` itself without a check will throw a `ReferenceError`!

### 2. Checking with `window` (For Browser Environments)

In browser environments, all global variables are properties of the `window` object (or `globalThis` in more recent environments). You can check if a variable is defined by checking if it exists as a property of the `window` object.  However, this approach only works for *global* variables.

```javascript
// In a browser context:

// Assume 'globalVariable' might or might not be defined globally.

if (window.globalVariable) { // Careful! This will throw an error if globalVariable is never declared.
  console.log('globalVariable exists!');
} else {
  console.log('globalVariable does not exist.');
}

if (typeof window.globalVariable !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('globalVariable exists! (using typeof)');
} else {
  console.log('globalVariable does not exist. (using typeof)');
}

//Safe way to check if a global variable is defined using 'in' operator
if ('globalVariable' in window) {
    console.log('globalVariable exists using in operator!');
} else {
    console.log('globalVariable does not exist using in operator.');
}
```

**Advantages of `window.variableName` (with caution):**

*   Directly checks if the variable is a property of the global scope.

**Disadvantages of `window.variableName`:**

*   **`ReferenceError` if not used with `typeof` or `'in'`**: Accessing `window.variableName` directly *without* checking with `typeof` or the `in` operator will throw a `ReferenceError` if `globalVariable` is never declared. **This is the biggest pitfall.**
*   **Only works for global variables**:  It won't work for variables defined within functions or blocks (local scope).  It's ineffective inside modules.
*   **Less Portable:**  It's specific to browser environments. Server-side JavaScript environments like Node.js use `global` instead of `window`.  Using `globalThis` helps with portability but requires checks to ensure it's available.

**Better Approach: Using the `in` Operator**

The `in` operator checks if a property exists within an object, and it's safe to use even if the property is not present.  In a browser, you can check if a global variable exists using `in window`. This is generally preferred over direct access without checks.

```javascript
if ('globalVariable' in window) {
  console.log('globalVariable is defined in the global scope.');
} else {
  console.log('globalVariable is not defined in the global scope.');
}
```

This is safe because it doesn't try to access the value of `globalVariable` directly until it's confirmed to exist.

### 3.  Conditional Statements (Less Reliable for Variables, Useful for Functions)

You might be tempted to use a simple `if` statement to check for the existence of a variable:

```javascript
// WARNING: This can be dangerous for variables!

let someVariable;

if (someVariable) { // Can cause a ReferenceError if someVariable is *never* declared.
  console.log('someVariable is truthy!');
} else {
  console.log('someVariable is falsy or undefined.'); // Correctly identifies that someVariable is currently falsy
}

//This will throw a ReferenceError
//if (anotherVariable) {
//    console.log("anotherVariable is truthy");
//}
```

**Why this is problematic for variables:**

If `someVariable` is *never* declared at all, this `if` statement will throw a `ReferenceError`.  It only works *after* the variable has been declared (even if it's `undefined`). This method is better used for functions, especially when checking for optional implementations.

## Checking if a Function is Defined in JavaScript

The same principles apply to checking if a function is defined.  You can use `typeof` or conditional statements (with more reliability) to determine if a function exists.

### 1. Using `typeof` to Check for Functions

The `typeof` operator is the safest and most reliable way to check if a function is defined. It returns `"function"` if the variable holds a function, and `"undefined"` otherwise.

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  console.log('myFunction is defined!');
}

console.log(typeof myFunction); // Output: "function"

if (typeof myFunction === 'function') {
  myFunction(); // Safely call the function
}

if (typeof notAFunction === 'function') {
    notAFunction(); //This won't execute, no error.
}
console.log(typeof notAFunction); // Output: undefined
```

### 2. Conditional Statements for Functions (Generally Safe)

Using conditional statements to check for functions is generally safer than for variables. This is because the JavaScript engine treats function declarations differently. If the function declaration *exists* in the scope, even if it's not executed yet, the engine knows about it.

```javascript
functionAnotherExample(); // No ReferenceError - the function is *declared* (but may not have executed yet).

if (functionAnotherExample) {
  functionAnotherExample(); // This works even though functionAnotherExample is not yet 'called' here.
}

function functionAnotherExample() {
  console.log("I'm functionAnotherExample!");
}

// However, a function expression assigned to a variable is different:
let myFunctionExpression; // Declared but undefined

// myFunctionExpression();  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myFunctionExpression' before initialization

if (myFunctionExpression) {
    console.log("This won't work safely");
}

if (typeof myFunctionExpression === 'function') {
    myFunctionExpression();
} else {
    console.log("myFunctionExpression is not a function (yet)."); //this line is output
}

myFunctionExpression = function() {
  console.log('myFunctionExpression is now defined!');
};

if (typeof myFunctionExpression === 'function') {
    myFunctionExpression(); // Now, this works!
}
```

**Key Differences between Function Declarations and Function Expressions:**

*   **Function Declarations (hoisted):**  Functions declared with the `function` keyword are *hoisted* to the top of their scope. This means you can call them before they appear in the code.
*   **Function Expressions (not hoisted):**  Functions assigned to variables (function expressions) are not hoisted. You must define the variable *and* assign the function to it before you can call it. If you try to call the function before it's initialized (e.g., `myFunctionExpression();` before `myFunctionExpression = function() { ... };`), you'll get a `ReferenceError`.

### Best Practices for TypeScript

TypeScript provides static typing, offering even more robust ways to handle potentially undefined variables and functions.

*   **Optional Properties and Parameters:**  Use the `?` operator to declare optional properties in interfaces or optional parameters in functions. This signals to the compiler that these values might be undefined.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name?: string; // Optional name property
}

function greetUser(user: User) {
  if (user.name) { // TypeScript knows user.name might be undefined, so a check is good practice.
    console.log(`Hello, ${user.name}!`);
  } else {
    console.log('Hello, User!');
  }
}

greetUser({ id: 1, name: 'Alice' }); // Output: Hello, Alice!
greetUser({ id: 2 }); // Output: Hello, User!
```

*   **Strict Null Checks:**  Enable the `strictNullChecks` compiler option in your `tsconfig.json`. This option enforces stricter type checking related to `null` and `undefined`. It forces you to explicitly handle potentially null or undefined values, preventing runtime errors.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true // Enable strict null checks
  }
}
```

With `strictNullChecks` enabled, you'll get compiler errors if you try to use a potentially null or undefined value without first checking if it exists.

```typescript
function maybeReturnString(input: number): string | undefined {
  if (input > 5) {
    return "Valid string";
  } else {
    return undefined;
  }
}

const result = maybeReturnString(3);

// console.log(result.toUpperCase()); // Error: Object is possibly 'undefined'.

if(result) {
    console.log(result.toUpperCase()); // TypeScript knows 'result' is not undefined here.
}
```

*   **Non-null Assertion Operator (!):**  Use the non-null assertion operator (`!`) to tell the TypeScript compiler that you're certain a value isn't null or undefined. However, use this operator with caution, as it can mask potential errors if you're wrong.

```typescript
let potentiallyNullString: string | null = "Hello";

// potentionallyNullString = null; //Uncommenting will cause problems at runtime with ! operator.

const uppercaseString: string = potentiallyNullString!.toUpperCase(); // TypeScript trusts that 'potentiallyNullString' is not null

console.log(uppercaseString);
```

Only use the `!` operator when you are absolutely sure the value is not null or undefined. In the example above, there is a comment showing where you might introduce an error.

*   **Optional Chaining (?.)**:  Safely access properties of an object, even if the object or an intermediate property is null or undefined. If a value is null or undefined, the expression short-circuits and returns undefined.

```typescript
interface Address {
  street?: string;
  city: string;
}

interface User {
  name: string;
  address?: Address;
}

const user1: User = { name: "John Doe" };
const user2: User = { name: "Jane Doe", address: { city: "New York" } };

console.log(user1.address?.street); // undefined (safe, no error)
console.log(user2.address?.street); // undefined (safe, no error if not defined)
console.log(user2.address?.city);   // New York
```

### Conclusion

Checking if a variable or function is defined is an essential practice for writing reliable JavaScript and TypeScript code. By using the `typeof` operator, the `in` operator (for global variables), and taking advantage of TypeScript's strict type checking features, you can avoid `ReferenceError` exceptions and ensure your code behaves predictably.  Remember to choose the method that best suits your specific needs and context, and always prioritize safety and readability.  By following these guidelines, you can write more robust and maintainable JavaScript and TypeScript applications.
