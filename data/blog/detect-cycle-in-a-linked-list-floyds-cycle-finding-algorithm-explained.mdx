# Detect Cycle in a Linked List: Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm Explained

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science. However, unlike arrays, linked lists can sometimes have cycles, where a node points back to a previous node in the list, creating a loop. Detecting these cycles is crucial for avoiding infinite loops and ensuring the integrity of your data. This blog post will delve into the intricacies of detecting cycles in linked lists, focusing on the renowned Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm).

## What is a Cycle in a Linked List?

A cycle exists in a linked list when following the `next` pointers leads you back to a node you've already visited. Imagine a straight path (a typical linked list). Now, picture the end of the path connecting back to somewhere in the middle. That's a cycle!

**Why is cycle detection important?**

- **Preventing Infinite Loops:** If you traverse a cyclic linked list without cycle detection, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop, eventually crashing your program.
- **Data Corruption:** Cycles can indicate underlying errors in how the linked list was constructed or manipulated. Identifying and resolving these cycles prevents further data corruption.
- **Algorithm Performance:** Knowing whether a list has a cycle can allow you to choose more efficient algorithms for other operations, as certain algorithms behave differently (or fail entirely) with cycles.

## Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)

Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm, provides an efficient way to detect cycles in a linked list. It uses two pointers, a "tortoise" (slow pointer) and a "hare" (fast pointer), that move through the linked list at different speeds.

**How it works:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start both the `tortoise` and `hare` pointers at the head of the linked list.

2.  **Iteration:** In each iteration:

    - The `tortoise` moves one node forward ( `tortoise = tortoise.next`).
    - The `hare` moves two nodes forward (`hare = hare.next.next`).

3.  **Collision:** If a cycle exists, the `tortoise` and `hare` will eventually meet (collide) at some node within the cycle.

4.  **Cycle Detection:** If the `hare` reaches the end of the list (i.e., `hare == null` or `hare.next == null`), it means there is no cycle.

5.  **Finding the Start of the Cycle (Optional):** After detecting a cycle, you can find the starting node of the cycle. To do this:
    - Keep the `tortoise` at the collision point.
    - Move the `hare` back to the head of the linked list.
    - Move both `tortoise` and `hare` one node at a time until they meet again. This meeting point will be the starting node of the cycle.

**Why does it work?**

Imagine the `hare` running around a circular track while the `tortoise` walks slowly. Eventually, the `hare` will catch up to the `tortoise` from behind. The speed difference guarantees a collision if a cycle exists. The mathematics behind finding the starting node of the cycle involves analyzing the distances traveled by each pointer.

## Code Examples

Here are code examples of Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm in JavaScript, Python, and Java. Each example includes a function to detect the cycle and optionally find the start of the cycle.

### JavaScript

```plaintext
class ListNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val
    this.next = null
  }
}

function detectCycle(head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) {
    return null // No cycle possible with 0 or 1 nodes
  }

  let tortoise = head
  let hare = head

  while (hare && hare.next) {
    tortoise = tortoise.next
    hare = hare.next.next

    if (tortoise === hare) {
      // Cycle detected!
      return tortoise // Return the collision point.
    }
  }

  return null // No cycle found
}

function findCycleStart(head) {
  let collisionPoint = detectCycle(head)

  if (!collisionPoint) {
    return null // No cycle, no start
  }

  let tortoise = collisionPoint
  let hare = head

  while (tortoise !== hare) {
    tortoise = tortoise.next
    hare = hare.next
  }

  return hare // Meeting point is the start of the cycle
}

// Example usage:
const head = new ListNode(3)
head.next = new ListNode(2)
head.next.next = new ListNode(0)
head.next.next.next = new ListNode(-4)
head.next.next.next.next = head.next // Create a cycle

const cycleStartNode = findCycleStart(head)

if (cycleStartNode) {
  console.log('Cycle detected! Start node value:', cycleStartNode.val)
} else {
  console.log('No cycle detected.')
}

//Example with no cycle

const head2 = new ListNode(1)
head2.next = new ListNode(2)

const cycleStartNode2 = findCycleStart(head2)

if (cycleStartNode2) {
  console.log('Cycle detected! Start node value:', cycleStartNode2.val)
} else {
  console.log('No cycle detected.')
}
```

### Python

```plaintext
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

def detect_cycle(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return None

    tortoise = head
    hare = head

    while hare and hare.next:
        tortoise = tortoise.next
        hare = hare.next.next

        if tortoise == hare:
            return tortoise  # Collision point

    return None # No cycle

def find_cycle_start(head):
    collision_point = detect_cycle(head)

    if not collision_point:
        return None

    tortoise = collision_point
    hare = head

    while tortoise != hare:
        tortoise = tortoise.next
        hare = hare.next

    return hare # Cycle start

# Example Usage
head = ListNode(3)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(0)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(-4)
head.next.next.next.next = head.next # Create a cycle

cycle_start = find_cycle_start(head)

if cycle_start:
    print("Cycle detected! Start node value:", cycle_start.val)
else:
    print("No cycle detected.")

#Example with no cycle

head2 = ListNode(1)
head2.next = ListNode(2)

cycle_start2 = find_cycle_start(head2)

if cycle_start2:
    print("Cycle detected! Start node value:", cycle_start2.val)
else:
    print("No cycle detected.")
```

### Java

```plaintext
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; this.next = null; }
}

public class LinkedListCycle {

    public static ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return null;
        }

        ListNode tortoise = head;
        ListNode hare = head;

        while (hare != null && hare.next != null) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next.next;

            if (tortoise == hare) {
                return tortoise; // Collision point
            }
        }

        return null; // No cycle
    }

    public static ListNode findCycleStart(ListNode head) {
        ListNode collisionPoint = detectCycle(head);

        if (collisionPoint == null) {
            return null;
        }

        ListNode tortoise = collisionPoint;
        ListNode hare = head;

        while (tortoise != hare) {
            tortoise = tortoise.next;
            hare = hare.next;
        }

        return hare; // Cycle start
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ListNode head = new ListNode(3);
        head.next = new ListNode(2);
        head.next.next = new ListNode(0);
        head.next.next.next = new ListNode(-4);
        head.next.next.next.next = head.next; // Create a cycle

        ListNode cycleStart = findCycleStart(head);

        if (cycleStart != null) {
            System.out.println("Cycle detected! Start node value: " + cycleStart.val);
        } else {
            System.out.println("No cycle detected.");
        }

        //Example with no cycle
        ListNode head2 = new ListNode(1);
        head2.next = new ListNode(2);

        ListNode cycleStart2 = findCycleStart(head2);

        if (cycleStart2 != null) {
            System.out.println("Cycle detected! Start node value: " + cycleStart2.val);
        } else {
            System.out.println("No cycle detected.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, the `hare` might traverse the entire list before colliding with the `tortoise`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The algorithm uses only two pointers, regardless of the list size. This makes it a very memory-efficient solution.

## Alternatives to Floyd's Algorithm

While Floyd's Algorithm is the most common and efficient, here are a couple of less common approaches:

- **Hashing:** You can traverse the linked list and store each node in a hash set (or hash table). If you encounter a node already present in the hash set, you've found a cycle.
  - **Pros:** Simple to understand and implement.
  - **Cons:** Requires O(N) space complexity for the hash set, which is less efficient than Floyd's Algorithm in terms of space.
- **Marking Visited Nodes:** You can modify the linked list by adding a "visited" flag to each node. When you visit a node, set its "visited" flag to `true`. If you encounter a node with the "visited" flag already set to `true`, you've found a cycle.
  - **Pros:** Simple to understand.
  - **Cons:** Modifies the original linked list, which might not be desirable. Also, it might not be possible if you don't have write access to the list.

## Conclusion

Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm provides a robust and efficient way to detect cycles in a linked list. Its O(1) space complexity makes it particularly valuable when memory is limited. Understanding and implementing this algorithm is an essential skill for any software engineer, especially when preparing for coding interviews. By mastering this technique, you'll be well-equipped to handle linked list manipulation challenges and write more reliable and efficient code. Remember to practice with different scenarios and linked list structures to solidify your understanding. Good luck!
