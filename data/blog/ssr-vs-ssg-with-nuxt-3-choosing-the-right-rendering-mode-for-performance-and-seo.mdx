# SSR vs SSG with Nuxt 3: Choosing the Right Rendering Mode for Performance & SEO

Choosing the right rendering mode is crucial for building performant and SEO-friendly web applications with Nuxt 3. This decision often comes down to choosing between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). Both offer distinct advantages and disadvantages, and understanding these differences is key to selecting the mode best suited for your specific project requirements.

In this guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of SSR and SSG within the Nuxt 3 ecosystem, exploring their benefits, drawbacks, and providing practical examples to help you make an informed decision.

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) involves rendering your application's pages on the server for each request. When a user requests a page, the server executes the JavaScript code, generates the HTML, and sends the fully rendered HTML to the browser. The browser then displays the content, which is already fully formed.

**Benefits of SSR:**

- **Improved SEO:** Search engines can easily crawl and index fully rendered HTML, leading to better search engine rankings. This is crucial for content-heavy websites and blogs that rely on organic traffic.
- **Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP) & Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Users see content quicker because the server delivers fully rendered HTML. This improves the perceived performance and user experience, especially on slower networks or devices.
- **Dynamic Content:** SSR is ideal for applications with frequently updated content or personalized user experiences. The server can dynamically generate content based on user requests and data.

**Drawbacks of SSR:**

- **Increased Server Load:** Each request requires server-side processing, which can increase server load and potentially impact performance if not properly optimized.
- **More Complex Infrastructure:** SSR requires a server environment to handle requests and execute JavaScript. This can add complexity to the deployment and maintenance process.
- **Time To First Byte (TTFB) Can Be Slower:** The server needs to process and render the page before sending it to the browser, which can lead to a slower TTFB compared to SSG.

**Example of SSR in Nuxt 3:**

Nuxt 3 defaults to SSR. Here's a simple example:

```plaintext
// pages/index.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to my SSR Nuxt 3 app!</h1>
    <p>The current time is: {{ currentTime }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  const currentTime = ref(new Date().toLocaleTimeString())
</script>
```

In this example, the `currentTime` is generated on the server for each request, demonstrating the dynamic nature of SSR. Each time you refresh the page, the time will update.

## What is Static Site Generation (SSG)?

Static Site Generation (SSG) involves pre-rendering your application's pages at build time. This means that all the HTML files are generated before deployment, and the server simply serves these static files when a user requests a page.

**Benefits of SSG:**

- **Excellent Performance:** Serving static files is incredibly fast, leading to exceptional performance and a smooth user experience.
- **Improved Security:** SSG reduces the attack surface because there's no server-side code execution.
- **Scalability:** SSG sites are easy to scale because they can be served from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) without requiring a server.
- **Lower Hosting Costs:** Static sites can be hosted on cost-effective platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

**Drawbacks of SSG:**

- **Rebuild for Content Updates:** Any changes to the content require a rebuild and redeployment of the entire site. This can be time-consuming for large websites with frequent updates.
- **Not Suitable for Highly Dynamic Content:** SSG is not ideal for applications with content that changes rapidly or requires real-time updates. User-specific data cannot be rendered statically.
- **Build Times Can Increase:** For large websites with many pages, the build process can take a significant amount of time.

**Example of SSG in Nuxt 3:**

To enable SSG in your Nuxt 3 project, you need to modify the `nuxt.config.ts` file and use the `nuxt generate` command:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false, // Disable server-side rendering
})
```

Then, run the following command to generate the static site:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This will create a `dist` directory containing the statically generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can then deploy this directory to a static hosting provider.

To generate dynamic routes with SSG (e.g., blog posts), you'll need to use the `generate` property in your `nuxt.config.ts`. This property accepts a function that returns an array of routes to generate. Here's an example:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false,
  generate: {
    routes: async () => {
      const { data } = await $fetch('/api/posts') // Assuming you have an API endpoint for posts
      return data.map((post) => `/blog/${post.slug}`)
    },
  },
})
```

In this example, the `generate.routes` function fetches a list of blog posts from an API endpoint and generates a route for each post based on its slug. This ensures that each blog post is pre-rendered at build time. You will need to ensure that you have a route `/api/posts` that returns a JSON object with a `slug` property.

## When to Choose SSR vs. SSG in Nuxt 3

Here's a guide to help you decide when to use SSR or SSG in Nuxt 3:

**Choose SSR if:**

- **SEO is a primary concern:** You need your website to be easily crawled and indexed by search engines.
- **Content is frequently updated:** You have dynamic content that changes frequently.
- **Personalization is important:** You need to display personalized content to users based on their preferences or data.
- **You need real-time data:** Your application relies on real-time data updates.
- **You are comfortable managing a server environment.**

**Choose SSG if:**

- **Performance is critical:** You need your website to load as quickly as possible.
- **Security is a major concern:** You want to minimize the attack surface of your application.
- **Content is relatively static:** Your content doesn't change frequently. Think blogs, documentation sites, portfolios, or marketing websites.
- **Scalability is important:** You need to handle a large volume of traffic without performance degradation.
- **You want to minimize hosting costs.**

## Nuxt 3 Hybrid Rendering (SSR and SSG combined)

Nuxt 3 offers a hybrid rendering approach, allowing you to combine the benefits of both SSR and SSG. You can statically generate most of your website's pages while using SSR for specific routes or components that require dynamic content or real-time updates.

To achieve this, you can use the `$fetch` hook in your components to fetch data on the client-side for specific sections of your page that require dynamic content, even if the rest of the page is statically generated.

**Example of Hybrid Rendering:**

Let's say you have a blog website where the majority of the content is static, but you want to display the current number of online users in real-time. You can statically generate the blog posts using SSG and then use the `$fetch` hook in a component to fetch the number of online users from an API endpoint on the client-side.

```plaintext
// components/OnlineUsers.vue
<template>
  <div>
    Online Users: {{ onlineUsers }}
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const { data: onlineUsers } = await useAsyncData('online-users', () => $fetch('/api/online-users'))
</script>
```

In this example, the `OnlineUsers` component fetches the number of online users from the `/api/online-users` endpoint on the client-side. This allows you to display dynamic content on a statically generated page.

## Conclusion

Choosing between SSR and SSG in Nuxt 3 depends on the specific requirements of your project. Consider the trade-offs between performance, SEO, content dynamism, and infrastructure complexity when making your decision. Nuxt 3's flexibility allows you to leverage both rendering modes and even create hybrid applications that combine the benefits of SSR and SSG. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, you can build a web application that is performant, SEO-friendly, and provides a great user experience.
