# Node.js Password Hashing: A Comprehensive Guide Using the Crypto Module

Protecting user passwords is a cornerstone of web application security. Storing passwords in plaintext is a huge vulnerability, leaving your users susceptible to data breaches. This guide delves into how to properly hash passwords in Node.js using the built-in `crypto` module. We'll explore different hashing algorithms, the importance of salting, and best practices for building a secure authentication system.

## Why Password Hashing Matters

Imagine a scenario where your database is compromised. If passwords are stored in plain text, attackers have immediate access to all user accounts. Hashing, on the other hand, transforms passwords into irreversible strings, making it significantly harder for attackers to access the original passwords, even if they gain access to your database.

**Here's why you _must_ hash passwords:**

- **Protection Against Data Breaches:** Hashing prevents attackers from directly accessing user passwords.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Many security standards and regulations require password hashing.
- **Enhanced User Trust:** Demonstrates a commitment to user data security.

## The Basics: Hashing and Salting

Before we dive into the code, let's clarify some key concepts:

- **Hashing:** A one-way function that transforms data (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters (the hash). It's computationally infeasible to reverse the hash back to the original password.
- **Salt:** A randomly generated string added to the password _before_ hashing. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed "rainbow tables" to crack passwords. Salts should be unique for each user and stored alongside the hashed password.
- **Cost Factor (Work Factor/Rounds):** A parameter that controls the computational effort required for hashing. A higher cost factor makes the hashing process slower, increasing the time it takes for attackers to crack passwords through brute-force attacks. As computing power increases over time, you should increase the cost factor to maintain security.

## Choosing a Hashing Algorithm

The `crypto` module in Node.js offers several hashing algorithms. However, **some are more suitable for password hashing than others.**

**Recommended Algorithms:**

- **bcrypt:** A widely used and well-regarded password hashing function. It incorporates salting and a configurable work factor, making it resistant to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. _While bcrypt is not directly available within the `crypto` module, a library is needed to use it like `bcrypt` or `bcryptjs`._
- **scrypt:** Designed specifically for password hashing, scrypt consumes a significant amount of memory in addition to CPU cycles, making it harder for attackers to perform parallel attacks. It is available within the `crypto` module, but `bcrypt` tends to be more popular due to its maturity and widespread usage.
- **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2):** While generally considered less secure than `bcrypt` or `scrypt` for _new_ applications, it's still often used in legacy systems. It allows you to specify the number of iterations (similar to the cost factor). It's available within the `crypto` module.

**Algorithms to Avoid:**

- **MD5 & SHA-1:** These algorithms are _cryptographically broken_ and should **never** be used for password hashing. They are too fast and vulnerable to collision attacks. While available in the `crypto` module, their use is highly discouraged.

## Implementing Password Hashing with the `crypto` Module

Let's explore how to use the `crypto` module to implement password hashing using `scrypt` and `PBKDF2`. Remember, for `bcrypt` you'll need to install a third-party package.

### Using `scrypt`

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto')

async function hashPasswordWithScrypt(password, salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')) {
  const algorithm = 'scrypt' // Fixed algorithm name
  const keylen = 64
  const cost = 16384 // CPU/memory cost parameter (2^n) - adjust this based on your resources
  const blocksize = 8 // Block size parameter
  const parallelization = 1 // Parallelization parameter

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    crypto.scrypt(
      password,
      salt,
      keylen,
      { N: cost, r: blocksize, p: parallelization },
      (err, derivedKey) => {
        if (err) {
          reject(err)
        } else {
          resolve({
            salt: salt,
            hashedPassword: derivedKey.toString('hex'),
            algorithm: algorithm,
            cost: cost,
            blocksize: blocksize,
            parallelization: parallelization,
          })
        }
      }
    )
  })
}

async function verifyPasswordWithScrypt(
  password,
  hashedPassword,
  salt,
  cost,
  blocksize,
  parallelization
) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    crypto.scrypt(
      password,
      salt,
      64,
      { N: cost, r: blocksize, p: parallelization },
      (err, derivedKey) => {
        if (err) {
          reject(err)
        }
        resolve(derivedKey.toString('hex') === hashedPassword)
      }
    )
  })
}

async function main() {
  const password = 'MySecurePassword123!'
  const { salt, hashedPassword, algorithm, cost, blocksize, parallelization } =
    await hashPasswordWithScrypt(password)

  console.log('Salt:', salt)
  console.log('Hashed Password:', hashedPassword)
  console.log('Algorithm:', algorithm)
  console.log('Cost:', cost)
  console.log('Blocksize:', blocksize)
  console.log('Parallelization:', parallelization)

  const isMatch = await verifyPasswordWithScrypt(
    password,
    hashedPassword,
    salt,
    cost,
    blocksize,
    parallelization
  )
  console.log('Password Match:', isMatch) // Output: true

  const wrongPasswordMatch = await verifyPasswordWithScrypt(
    'wrongPassword',
    hashedPassword,
    salt,
    cost,
    blocksize,
    parallelization
  )
  console.log('Password Match (wrong password):', wrongPasswordMatch)
}

main()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')`**: Generates a 16-byte (128-bit) random salt and converts it to a hexadecimal string.
2.  **`crypto.scrypt(password, salt, keylen, options, callback)`**: This function performs the `scrypt` hashing.
    - `password`: The password to hash.
    - `salt`: The salt to use.
    - `keylen`: The desired length of the derived key (in bytes). 64 bytes (512 bits) is a reasonable choice.
    - `options`: An object containing the parameters for `scrypt`:
      - `N`: CPU/memory cost parameter (2^n). Higher values increase computational cost.
      - `r`: Block size parameter.
      - `p`: Parallelization parameter.
    - `callback`: A function that receives the derived key (or an error).
3.  **`derivedKey.toString('hex')`**: Converts the derived key to a hexadecimal string for storage.
4.  **Verification:** When verifying the password, you reuse the salt, cost, blocksize and parallelization parameters to hash the entered password again and compare it to the stored hashed password.

**Important Considerations for `scrypt`:**

- **Memory Usage:** `scrypt` is memory-intensive. The `cost` parameter (N) significantly impacts memory consumption. Choose a value that balances security with available resources. Testing is crucial to ensure performance doesn't degrade excessively.
- **Parameter Selection:** Carefully select the `cost`, `blocksize`, and `parallelization` parameters. There's no one-size-fits-all value. Research recommended settings based on current hardware capabilities.
- **Algorithm Parameter Storage:** It's crucial to store the `salt`, `cost`, `blocksize` and `parallelization` along with the hashed password in your database. You'll need these parameters to verify the password later. Storing the algorithm is a good practice to maintain compatibility with future updates or algorithm changes.
- **Asynchronous Operation:** `crypto.scrypt` is an asynchronous function. Use callbacks or promises to handle the results.

### Using `PBKDF2`

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto')

async function hashPasswordWithPBKDF2(password, salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')) {
  const algorithm = 'pbkdf2'
  const iterations = 10000 // Number of iterations - adjust for security vs. performance
  const keylen = 64 // Desired key length (in bytes)
  const digest = 'sha512' // Hash algorithm to use

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest, (err, derivedKey) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err)
      } else {
        resolve({
          salt: salt,
          hashedPassword: derivedKey.toString('hex'),
          algorithm: algorithm,
          iterations: iterations,
          keylen: keylen,
          digest: digest,
        })
      }
    })
  })
}

async function verifyPasswordWithPBKDF2(
  password,
  hashedPassword,
  salt,
  iterations,
  keylen,
  digest
) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest, (err, derivedKey) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err)
      }
      resolve(derivedKey.toString('hex') === hashedPassword)
    })
  })
}

async function mainPBKDF2() {
  const password = 'MySecurePassword123!'
  const { salt, hashedPassword, algorithm, iterations, keylen, digest } =
    await hashPasswordWithPBKDF2(password)

  console.log('Salt:', salt)
  console.log('Hashed Password:', hashedPassword)
  console.log('Algorithm:', algorithm)
  console.log('Iterations:', iterations)
  console.log('Key Length:', keylen)
  console.log('Digest:', digest)

  const isMatch = await verifyPasswordWithPBKDF2(
    password,
    hashedPassword,
    salt,
    iterations,
    keylen,
    digest
  )
  console.log('Password Match:', isMatch) // Output: true

  const wrongPasswordMatch = await verifyPasswordWithPBKDF2(
    'wrongPassword',
    hashedPassword,
    salt,
    iterations,
    keylen,
    digest
  )
  console.log('Password Match (wrong password):', wrongPasswordMatch)
}

mainPBKDF2()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`crypto.pbkdf2(password, salt, iterations, keylen, digest, callback)`**: This function performs PBKDF2 hashing.
    - `password`: The password to hash.
    - `salt`: The salt to use.
    - `iterations`: The number of iterations. A higher number increases security but also increases processing time. Start with at least 10,000 iterations and increase as computing power grows.
    - `keylen`: The desired key length (in bytes). 64 bytes (512 bits) is a reasonable choice.
    - `digest`: The hash algorithm to use (e.g., 'sha512'). SHA-512 is generally preferred over SHA-256.
    - `callback`: A function that receives the derived key (or an error).
2.  **`derivedKey.toString('hex')`**: Converts the derived key to a hexadecimal string for storage.

**Important Considerations for `PBKDF2`:**

- **Iterations:** The `iterations` parameter is crucial for security. Start with a high number (at least 10,000) and increase it over time as hardware capabilities improve. Monitor the performance impact as you increase iterations.
- **Digest Algorithm:** Use a strong digest algorithm like `sha512`.
- **Algorithm Parameter Storage:** You _must_ store the `salt`, `iterations`, `keylen`, and `digest` algorithm along with the hashed password.
- **Asynchronous Operation:** `crypto.pbkdf2` is an asynchronous function.

### Using `bcrypt` (With `bcryptjs` Package)

Since `bcrypt` isn't part of the `crypto` core module, you need to install it:

```plaintext
npm install bcryptjs
```

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs')

async function hashPasswordWithBcrypt(password) {
  const saltRounds = 10 // Cost factor - adjust this for security vs. performance

  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds)
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt)

  return {
    salt: salt,
    hashedPassword: hashedPassword,
    saltRounds: saltRounds,
  }
}

async function verifyPasswordWithBcrypt(password, hashedPassword) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword)
}

async function mainBcrypt() {
  const password = 'MySecurePassword123!'
  const { salt, hashedPassword, saltRounds } = await hashPasswordWithBcrypt(password)

  console.log('Salt:', salt)
  console.log('Hashed Password:', hashedPassword)
  console.log('Salt Rounds:', saltRounds)

  const isMatch = await verifyPasswordWithBcrypt(password, hashedPassword)
  console.log('Password Match:', isMatch) // Output: true

  const wrongPasswordMatch = await verifyPasswordWithBcrypt('wrongPassword', hashedPassword)
  console.log('Password Match (wrong password):', wrongPasswordMatch)
}

mainBcrypt()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds)`**: Generates a salt with the specified number of rounds (the cost factor). Higher rounds increase security but also increase hashing time. A value of 10 is a good starting point but should be increased over time. Note that the salt is incorporated into the final `hashedPassword` result so you typically don't need to store it seperately.
2.  **`bcrypt.hash(password, salt)`**: Hashes the password using the generated salt and the configured number of rounds.
3.  **`bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword)`**: Compares the provided password (plain text) with the stored hashed password. This function automatically handles the salt and cost factor.

**Important Considerations for `bcrypt`:**

- **Cost Factor (Salt Rounds):** The `saltRounds` parameter (cost factor) is critical. Increase this value to improve security as hardware capabilities increase. Aim for a hashing time of around 0.1 to 1 second per hash on your server hardware.
- **Error Handling:** Always handle potential errors during the hashing and comparison processes.
- **Ease of Use:** `bcrypt` handles salt generation and storage internally, making it generally easier to use than `scrypt` or `PBKDF2`. However, understanding the importance of the cost factor is essential.
- **The generated salt is already embedded into the hashed password** so you don't need to store it.

## Best Practices for Password Hashing in Node.js

- **Choose a Strong Algorithm:** Prioritize `bcrypt` for new applications. If you have legacy systems using PBKDF2, consider migrating to `bcrypt` where feasible.
- **Use Unique Salts:** Generate a unique salt for each password.
- **Store Salts Securely:** Store the salt (and other algorithm parameters if applicable) alongside the hashed password in your database. For bcrypt, this is automatically done.
- **Increase the Cost Factor Over Time:** Regularly evaluate and increase the cost factor (iterations or salt rounds) to keep pace with advancements in computing power.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
- **Input Validation:** Validate user input to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like salts and API keys in environment variables rather than hardcoding them into your application.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server, protecting passwords in transit.

## Example Schema Considerations

When storing passwords in your database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL), consider the following schema structure:

**Example (MongoDB with Mongoose):**

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  hashedPassword: { type: String, required: true },
  algorithm: { type: String, required: true }, //bcrypt does not need this
  salt: { type: String }, //bcrypt does not need this
  iterations: { type: Number }, //bcrypt does not need this
  keylen: { type: Number }, //bcrypt does not need this
  digest: { type: String }, //bcrypt does not need this
  cost: { type: Number }, // Used for scrypt
  blocksize: { type: Number }, // Used for scrypt
  parallelization: { type: Number }, // Used for scrypt
  saltRounds: { type: Number }, // Used for bcrypt
})

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

module.exports = User
```

**Explanation:**

- `hashedPassword`: Stores the hashed password.
- `algorithm`: Stores the hashing algorithm used. _Not needed for bcrypt._
- `salt`: Stores the unique salt used for hashing. _Not needed for bcrypt._
- `iterations`: Stores the number of iterations used (for PBKDF2).
- `keylen`: Stores the key length used (for PBKDF2 and scrypt).
- `digest`: Stores the digest algorithm used (for PBKDF2).
- `cost`, `blocksize`, `parallelization`: Store scrypt specific parameters.
- `saltRounds`: Store bcrypt salt rounds.

## Conclusion

Secure password hashing is a crucial aspect of web application security. By using the `crypto` module (or bcrypt library) in Node.js and following best practices, you can significantly enhance the protection of your user's credentials. Remember to stay informed about the latest security recommendations and regularly update your hashing strategies to mitigate evolving threats. Choosing the right algorithm, using salts, increasing cost factors, and implementing other security measures will help you build a robust and secure authentication system. Choose `bcrypt` for best results and ease of use.
