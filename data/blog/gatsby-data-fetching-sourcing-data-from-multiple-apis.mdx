# Gatsby Data Fetching: Sourcing Data from Multiple APIs

Gatsby is a powerful static site generator that allows you to build blazing-fast websites with React. A key feature of Gatsby is its ability to fetch data from various sources at build time, making it incredibly efficient. Often, you'll need to pull data from multiple APIs to create a complete and dynamic website. This blog post will guide you through the process of sourcing data from multiple APIs in Gatsby, using source plugins and GraphQL.

## Why Source Data from Multiple APIs in Gatsby?

Modern web applications often rely on data from various sources. Think of a blog that displays articles from a CMS (Content Management System), user profiles from a social media API, and product information from an e-commerce platform. Gatsby excels at bringing all these data sources together into a single, cohesive website.

Here are some key benefits of sourcing data from multiple APIs in Gatsby:

- **Centralized Data Layer:** Gatsby's GraphQL layer provides a unified interface for querying data from all your sources.
- **Performance Optimization:** Data is fetched and transformed at build time, resulting in faster page load times and improved user experience.
- **Flexibility:** Gatsby's plugin ecosystem makes it easy to integrate with a wide range of APIs and data sources.
- **Improved SEO:** Static rendering makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content, leading to better SEO performance.

## Approaches to Sourcing Data from Multiple APIs

There are several approaches to sourcing data from multiple APIs in Gatsby. The most common and recommended approach involves creating or using existing Gatsby source plugins. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Using Existing Gatsby Source Plugins:** Check if a Gatsby source plugin already exists for the API you want to integrate with. This is the easiest approach, as the plugin handles the data fetching and transformation logic for you.

2.  **Creating a Custom Gatsby Source Plugin:** If no plugin exists for your API, you can create your own. This gives you complete control over the data fetching and transformation process.

3.  **Direct API Calls (Less Recommended):** While possible, making direct API calls within your components is generally discouraged. This can lead to performance issues and makes it difficult to manage data consistently.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Sourcing Data with Source Plugins

Let's walk through an example of sourcing data from two different APIs:

- **JSONPlaceholder:** A free online REST API that provides fake data for testing and prototyping. We'll use it to fetch a list of posts.
- **Random User API:** A free API for generating random user data. We'll use it to fetch user profiles.

### 1. Install Necessary Packages

First, create a new Gatsby project if you don't have one already:

```plaintext
gatsby new my-gatsby-site
cd my-gatsby-site
```

Next, install the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin (we'll use it for a simple local data source) and necessary development packages for local plugin creation:

```plaintext
npm install gatsby-source-filesystem
npm install --save-dev prettier eslint eslint-plugin-react
```

### 2. Create a Custom Source Plugin (for Random User API)

Since there might not be a pre-built plugin perfectly tailored to your needs (or for learning purposes), let's create a custom source plugin for the Random User API.

Create a new directory in your project's `plugins` folder called `gatsby-source-randomuser`. Inside this directory, create a file called `gatsby-node.js`.

```plaintext
mkdir plugins
mkdir plugins/gatsby-source-randomuser
touch plugins/gatsby-source-randomuser/gatsby-node.js
```

Now, open `plugins/gatsby-source-randomuser/gatsby-node.js` and add the following code:

```plaintext
const fetch = require('node-fetch') // Import node-fetch

exports.sourceNodes = async ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }, configOptions) => {
  const { createNode } = actions
  const { numUsers = 5 } = configOptions // Default to fetching 5 users

  // Helper function to create a node
  const processUser = (user) => {
    const nodeId = createNodeId(`randomuser-${user.email}`)
    const nodeContent = JSON.stringify(user)
    const nodeData = Object.assign({}, user, {
      id: nodeId,
      parent: null,
      children: [],
      internal: {
        type: `RandomUser`,
        content: nodeContent,
        contentDigest: createContentDigest(user),
      },
    })
    return nodeData
  }

  // Fetch data from Random User API
  const apiUrl = `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=${numUsers}`
  const response = await fetch(apiUrl)
  const data = await response.json()

  // Create nodes for each user
  data.results.forEach((user) => {
    const nodeData = processUser(user)
    createNode(nodeData)
  })

  return
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`sourceNodes` Function:** This is the core function that Gatsby calls when the plugin is loaded.
- **`actions`:** Provides access to Gatsby's actions, including `createNode` for creating new nodes in the GraphQL data layer.
- **`createNodeId`:** A helper function for generating unique IDs for each node. Important for Gatsby's caching and data management.
- **`createContentDigest`:** Generates a unique hash of the node's content. This is used to determine if a node has changed and needs to be updated.
- **`configOptions`:** Allows you to pass configuration options to the plugin from `gatsby-config.js`. We use it here to specify the number of users to fetch.
- **`fetch`:** We use the `node-fetch` library to make the API request. Make sure you have it installed (`npm install node-fetch`).
- **`processUser` Function:** Transforms the raw API data into a Gatsby node. This includes setting the node's ID, content, and internal metadata.
- **API Call:** Fetches data from the Random User API using `node-fetch`.
- **Node Creation:** Iterates over the results and creates a Gatsby node for each user.

### 3. Configure Gatsby

Open your `gatsby-config.js` file and add the following configuration:

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Gatsby Site`,
    siteUrl: `https://www.example.com`,
    description: `A sample Gatsby site sourcing data from multiple APIs`,
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-manifest`,
      options: {
        name: `gatsby-starter-default`,
        short_name: `starter`,
        start_url: `/`,
        background_color: `#663399`,
        theme_color: `#663399`,
        display: `minimal-ui`,
        icon: `src/images/gatsby-icon.png`, // This path is relative to the root of the site.
      },
    },
    // Add the custom plugin
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-randomuser`,
      options: {
        numUsers: 10, // Fetch 10 users
      },
    },
    // Add the JSON Placeholder API
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-jsonplaceholder`,
      options: {
        typeName: `JsonPlaceholderPost`,
        postId: 1, // Specify a single postId, or omit to fetch all posts
      },
    },
    // this (optional) plugin enables Progressive Web App + Offline functionality
    // To learn more, visit: https://gatsby.dev/offline
    // `gatsby-plugin-offline`,
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`gatsby-source-randomuser`:** This plugin configuration tells Gatsby to use the custom source plugin we created. We pass the `numUsers` option to specify the number of users to fetch.
- **`gatsby-source-filesystem`:** We use it to load static images from the filesystem (already setup in the starter).
- **`gatsby-source-jsonplaceholder`:** To leverage existing plugin we install `gatsby-source-jsonplaceholder`, then add it.

```plaintext
npm install gatsby-source-jsonplaceholder
```

### 4. Query the Data with GraphQL

Now you can query the data from both APIs using GraphQL. Open `src/pages/index.js` and update it with the following code:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { GatsbyImage, getImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image'

const IndexPage = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Sourcing Data from Multiple APIs</h1>

      <h2>Random Users:</h2>
      <ul>
        {data.allRandomUser.nodes.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.email}>
            {user.name.first} {user.name.last} ({user.email})
            <img src={user.picture.thumbnail} alt="User Thumbnail" />
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h2>JSONPlaceholder Post:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Title:</b>
        {data.jsonplaceholderPost.title}
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Body:</b>
        {data.jsonplaceholderPost.body}
      </p>
    </main>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    allRandomUser {
      nodes {
        email
        name {
          first
          last
        }
        picture {
          thumbnail
        }
      }
    }
    jsonplaceholderPost {
      title
      body
    }
  }
`

export default IndexPage
```

**Explanation:**

- **GraphQL Query:** The GraphQL query retrieves data from both the `allRandomUser` and `jsonplaceholderPost` data sources.
- **Data Mapping:** The component iterates over the `allRandomUser` nodes and displays the user's name, email, and thumbnail. It then shows the title and body of the `jsonplaceholderPost` post.
- **Data Access:** The data returned from the GraphQL query is available in the `data` prop of the component.

### 5. Run Gatsby Development Server

Now, start the Gatsby development server:

```plaintext
gatsby develop
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see a list of random users and details from the JSONPlaceholder post, demonstrating that you've successfully sourced data from multiple APIs.

## Best Practices for Sourcing Data from APIs

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your source plugins to gracefully handle API failures.
- **Caching:** Leverage Gatsby's built-in caching mechanisms to improve build times.
- **Pagination:** If your API returns large datasets, implement pagination to avoid overwhelming Gatsby.
- **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of API rate limits and implement appropriate strategies to avoid being throttled.
- **Security:** Never expose API keys or other sensitive information in your client-side code. Use environment variables to store sensitive data.
- **Data Transformation:** Transform the data from the API into a format that is easy to work with in your components.

## Conclusion

Sourcing data from multiple APIs is a common requirement for modern web applications. Gatsby provides a powerful and flexible framework for fetching and transforming data from various sources, enabling you to build dynamic and high-performance websites. By using source plugins and GraphQL, you can create a unified data layer that makes it easy to manage and query data from all your APIs. This guide provides a foundation for building more complex Gatsby projects that leverage multiple data sources. Experiment with different APIs and plugins to create truly unique and data-rich experiences.
