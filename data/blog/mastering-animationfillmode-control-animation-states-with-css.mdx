# Mastering `animationFillMode`: Control Animation States with CSS

Animations are crucial for creating engaging and interactive web experiences. The `animationFillMode` CSS property is a powerful tool for fine-tuning animation behavior, specifically controlling how an element appears _before_ an animation starts (initial state) and _after_ it finishes (final state). Without `animationFillMode`, the element reverts to its original styles. This post provides an in-depth look at `animationFillMode`, covering its values, use cases, and practical examples to help you master its capabilities.

## What is `animationFillMode`?

The `animationFillMode` property in CSS defines how an animation applies styles to its target element when the animation is not actively running. It addresses two specific scenarios:

1.  **Before the animation starts:** How should the element look before the animation's first keyframe?
2.  **After the animation finishes:** How should the element look after the animation's last keyframe?

By default, when an animation is not running, the element returns to its original, pre-animation styles. `animationFillMode` allows you to override this default behavior, ensuring a smoother and more predictable user experience.

## Understanding the Values of `animationFillMode`

`animationFillMode` accepts the following values:

- **`none` (Default):** The animation doesn't apply any styles to the element before or after it's running. The element reverts to its original style.

- **`forwards`:** The element retains the style values that are applied by the _last_ keyframe of the animation during the last iteration. This means the element "sticks" in the final animated state after the animation completes.

- **`backwards`:** The element adopts the style values defined in the _first_ keyframe of the animation as soon as the animation is applied, even before it starts. This prepares the element visually for the animation's start.

- **`both`:** The element follows the rules for both `forwards` and `backwards`. It applies the styles from the first keyframe before the animation begins and retains the styles from the last keyframe after the animation ends. This is generally the most useful value for ensuring smooth transitions.

## Practical Examples and Code Snippets

Let's illustrate the use of `animationFillMode` with code examples.

**Example 1: Using `forwards` to Keep the Final Animation State**

Consider a simple animation that moves an element to the right:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'

const AnimationForwards = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="box forwards">Animation with forwards</div>
      <style jsx>{`
        .container {
          display: flex;
          flex-direction: column;
          align-items: center;
          gap: 20px;
        }

        .box {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: #3498db;
          color: white;
          text-align: center;
          line-height: 100px;
          animation-name: slideRight;
          animation-duration: 2s;
          animation-iteration-count: 1;
        }

        .forwards {
          animation-fill-mode: forwards;
        }

        @keyframes slideRight {
          from {
            transform: translateX(0);
          }
          to {
            transform: translateX(200px);
          }
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default AnimationForwards
```

In this example, the `forwards` value ensures that the element stays at `translateX(200px)` after the animation finishes. Without `animation-fill-mode: forwards`, the element would snap back to its original position.

**Example 2: Using `backwards` to Set the Initial State**

Imagine an animation that fades an element in:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'

const AnimationBackwards = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="box backwards">Animation with backwards</div>
      <style jsx>{`
        .container {
          display: flex;
          flex-direction: column;
          align-items: center;
          gap: 20px;
        }

        .box {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: #3498db;
          color: white;
          text-align: center;
          line-height: 100px;
          animation-name: fadeIn;
          animation-duration: 2s;
          animation-delay: 1s;
          animation-iteration-count: 1;
        }

        .backwards {
          animation-fill-mode: backwards;
        }

        @keyframes fadeIn {
          from {
            opacity: 0;
          }
          to {
            opacity: 1;
          }
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default AnimationBackwards
```

Here, even though there's a 1-second `animation-delay`, the element starts with `opacity: 0` (defined in the `from` keyframe) thanks to `animation-fill-mode: backwards`. Without it, the element would be fully visible until the animation starts, then fade in.

**Example 3: Combining `forwards` and `backwards` with `both`**

This is generally the most useful and versatile setting:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'

const AnimationBoth = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="box both">Animation with both</div>
      <style jsx>{`
        .container {
          display: flex;
          flex-direction: column;
          align-items: center;
          gap: 20px;
        }

        .box {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: #3498db;
          color: white;
          text-align: center;
          line-height: 100px;
          animation-name: moveAndFade;
          animation-duration: 2s;
          animation-delay: 1s;
          animation-iteration-count: 1;
        }

        .both {
          animation-fill-mode: both;
        }

        @keyframes moveAndFade {
          from {
            transform: translateX(-100px);
            opacity: 0;
          }
          to {
            transform: translateX(100px);
            opacity: 1;
          }
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default AnimationBoth
```

With `animation-fill-mode: both`, the element starts with `translateX(-100px)` and `opacity: 0` due to the `from` keyframe and the `backwards` part of `both`. After the animation, it stays at `translateX(100px)` and `opacity: 1` because of the `to` keyframe and the `forwards` part of `both`. This ensures a clean transition from start to finish.

**Example 4: Multiple Animations**

`animationFillMode` can also be defined alongside other animation properties like `animationName`, `animationDuration`, etc.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'

const MultipleAnimations = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="box multiple">Multiple Animation Properties</div>
      <style jsx>{`
        .container {
          display: flex;
          flex-direction: column;
          align-items: center;
          gap: 20px;
        }

        .box {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: #3498db;
          color: white;
          text-align: center;
          line-height: 100px;
          animation-name: colorChange;
          animation-duration: 3s;
          animation-iteration-count: infinite;
          animation-direction: alternate;
          animation-fill-mode: both; // Explicitly setting animationFillMode
        }

        @keyframes colorChange {
          from {
            background-color: #3498db;
            transform: rotate(0deg);
          }
          to {
            background-color: #e74c3c;
            transform: rotate(360deg);
          }
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MultipleAnimations
```

In this example, `animationFillMode: both` ensures a consistent appearance throughout the continuous animation.

## Common Use Cases

- **Loading Indicators:** Keep the loading indicator visible after the loading animation completes until the data is fully loaded.
- **Interactive Buttons:** Maintain a highlighted state on a button after a click animation.
- **Intro Animations:** Ensure elements remain in their animated positions after an initial entrance animation.
- **Transition Effects:** Provide a smooth visual flow between different states of a web page.

## Important Considerations

- **Specificity:** `animationFillMode` is a standard CSS property, and its behavior is governed by CSS specificity rules. Ensure that the style rules containing `animationFillMode` have sufficient specificity to override any conflicting styles.
- **Performance:** Overusing complex animations can impact performance. Optimize your animations and use `animationFillMode` judiciously to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.
- **Readability:** When using multiple animation properties, consider using the `animation` shorthand to improve code readability:

  ```plaintext
  .box {
    animation: slideRight 2s forwards; /* Shorthand property */
  }
  ```

## Conclusion

The `animationFillMode` CSS property is a powerful tool for controlling the appearance of elements before and after animations. By understanding the different values and their implications, you can create more polished and user-friendly web animations. Experiment with the examples provided and integrate `animationFillMode` into your projects to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of your web applications.
