# API Key Rotation in FastAPI: Secure and Seamless Management

API keys are a fundamental part of modern API security, allowing you to control access to your resources and track usage. However, static API keys pose a security risk. If compromised, they can grant unauthorized access to your data and services.  API key rotation is the process of periodically changing your API keys to mitigate this risk.  This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to implement API key rotation in FastAPI applications, ensuring both security and minimal disruption to your users.

## Why API Key Rotation is Crucial

Think of API keys like physical keys to your house.  You wouldn't leave the same key under the doormat forever, right?  Similarly, relying on a single, unchanging API key for an extended period makes your API vulnerable.  Here's why rotation is important:

*   **Compromise Mitigation:** If a key is compromised (e.g., through a data breach, accidental exposure in code, or phishing), rotating the keys invalidates the compromised key, limiting the damage.
*   **Regular Security Hygiene:**  Rotation is a best practice for overall security hygiene.  Regularly changing keys makes it harder for attackers to gain and maintain persistent access.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Some regulatory frameworks require regular key rotation as part of their security standards.
*   **Improved Auditing:** Rotating keys can simplify auditing and tracking of API usage.  You can associate specific key versions with specific periods or users.
*   **Deprecation of Old Keys:** Allows for planned deprecation of older key versions, possibly with more permissive access levels as users are migrated.

## Strategies for API Key Rotation in FastAPI

Several strategies can be employed for API key rotation in FastAPI.  The best approach depends on your application's architecture, security requirements, and user base. We'll explore a few common and effective methods:

**1. Simple Replacement (with Grace Period):**

This is the most straightforward approach. A new key is generated, and clients are notified to update their applications. A grace period is provided during which both the old and new keys are valid. After the grace period, the old key is revoked.

**Pros:**

*   Easy to implement.
*   Requires minimal code changes.

**Cons:**

*   Requires communication with clients, which can be challenging.
*   Clients need to update their applications promptly.
*   Downtime might occur if clients fail to update within the grace period.

**Code Example (Simple Replacement with Grace Period):**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Header
from typing import Optional
import datetime
import secrets

app = FastAPI()

# Store API keys (ideally in a database or secrets management system)
API_KEYS = {
    "current_key": "supersecretkey123",
    "previous_key": "oldsecretkey456",
    "key_creation_time": datetime.datetime.now(),
    "grace_period": datetime.timedelta(days=7)
}


async def api_key_auth(x_api_key: Optional[str] = Header(None)):
    """
    Authentication dependency to validate the API key.
    """
    global API_KEYS  # Access the global API_KEYS

    if not x_api_key:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="X-API-Key header missing")

    current_time = datetime.datetime.now()

    # Check the current key
    if x_api_key == API_KEYS["current_key"]:
        return True

    # Check the previous key during the grace period
    if x_api_key == API_KEYS["previous_key"] and current_time <= (API_KEYS["key_creation_time"] + API_KEYS["grace_period"]):
        print("Using the previous API key during grace period.")
        return True

    raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API Key")


@app.get("/protected-resource", dependencies=[Depends(api_key_auth)])
async def protected_resource():
    """
    A protected endpoint requiring a valid API key.
    """
    return {"message": "Successfully accessed the protected resource!"}


# Example function to simulate key rotation (would typically be an automated process)
def rotate_api_keys():
    """
    Simulates the API key rotation process. In a real-world scenario, this would involve:
    1. Generating a new API key.
    2. Updating the API_KEYS dictionary (ideally updating the database).
    3. Notifying clients to update their API keys.
    """
    global API_KEYS
    new_key = secrets.token_urlsafe(32) # Generate a strong, random key
    API_KEYS["previous_key"] = API_KEYS["current_key"]
    API_KEYS["current_key"] = new_key
    API_KEYS["key_creation_time"] = datetime.datetime.now()
    print(f"API keys rotated. New key: {new_key}") # In real life, don't print the key to the console. Log it securely.

# This would normally be triggered by a scheduled task or a management endpoint.
# For demonstration, we'll just call it directly.
# rotate_api_keys()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`API_KEYS` Dictionary:** This dictionary stores the current and previous API keys, the key creation time, and the grace period.  **Important:**  In a real-world application, *never* store API keys directly in code like this. Use a secure secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) or a database with proper encryption.
*   **`api_key_auth` Dependency:** This dependency checks if the `X-API-Key` header is present and if it matches either the current key or the previous key (within the grace period).
*   **`rotate_api_keys` Function:** This function simulates the key rotation process.  In a production environment, this would be an automated process triggered by a scheduler or an administrative endpoint. It generates a new key, updates the `API_KEYS` dictionary, and (critically) notifies clients to update their keys.
*   **Grace Period:** The grace period allows clients time to update their applications to use the new key without immediate downtime.

**Important Considerations for the Simple Replacement Method:**

*   **Secret Management:**  Never hardcode API keys in your code. Store them securely in a secrets management system or an encrypted database.
*   **Notification:**  Implement a robust notification system to inform clients about the key rotation schedule and the new key.  Consider using email, push notifications, or API endpoints to deliver this information.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor the usage of both the old and new keys during the grace period to track client migration and identify potential issues.
*   **Error Handling:**  Provide clear error messages to clients who are still using the old key after the grace period.

**2. Versioned API Keys:**

Assign versions to your API keys. Clients specify the key version they are using. The server supports multiple key versions simultaneously, allowing for gradual migration.

**Pros:**

*   More flexible than simple replacement.
*   Allows for gradual migration.
*   Reduces the risk of downtime.

**Cons:**

*   More complex to implement and manage.
*   Requires supporting multiple key versions.

**Code Example (Versioned API Keys):**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Header
from typing import Optional, Dict
import secrets

app = FastAPI()

# Store API keys with versions (ideally in a database or secrets management system)
API_KEYS: Dict[str, str] = {
    "v1": "supersecretkey123",
    "v2": "anothersecretkey456",
    "v3": "yetanothersecretkey789"
}


async def api_key_auth(x_api_key_version: Optional[str] = Header(None), x_api_key: Optional[str] = Header(None)):
    """
    Authentication dependency to validate the API key and its version.
    """

    if not x_api_key_version:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="X-API-Key-Version header missing")

    if not x_api_key:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="X-API-Key header missing")

    if x_api_key_version not in API_KEYS:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API Key Version")

    if API_KEYS[x_api_key_version] != x_api_key:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API Key")

    return True


@app.get("/protected-resource", dependencies=[Depends(api_key_auth)])
async def protected_resource():
    """
    A protected endpoint requiring a valid API key and version.
    """
    return {"message": "Successfully accessed the protected resource!"}


# Example function to simulate key rotation (would typically be an automated process)
def rotate_api_keys():
    """
    Simulates the API key rotation process by adding a new version.
    In a real-world scenario, this would involve:
    1. Generating a new API key.
    2. Adding the new key with a new version to the API_KEYS dictionary (ideally updating the database).
    3. Notifying clients to update their applications.
    """
    global API_KEYS
    new_version = f"v{len(API_KEYS) + 1}"  # Simple versioning scheme
    new_key = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
    API_KEYS[new_version] = new_key
    print(f"Added new API key version: {new_version} with key {new_key}")  # Secure logging is important

# This would normally be triggered by a scheduled task or a management endpoint.
# For demonstration, we'll just call it directly.
# rotate_api_keys()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`API_KEYS` Dictionary (Versioned):** The `API_KEYS` dictionary now stores keys associated with specific versions (e.g., "v1", "v2").
*   **`api_key_auth` Dependency (Versioned):**  The authentication dependency now requires *two* headers: `X-API-Key-Version` and `X-API-Key`. It checks if the provided version exists and if the corresponding key matches.
*   **Rotation Process:**  The `rotate_api_keys` function now *adds* a new version to the `API_KEYS` dictionary instead of replacing the existing key. This allows the server to support multiple versions concurrently.
*   **Client Migration:** Clients are instructed to upgrade to the new key version when it's released.  The server continues to support older versions for a defined period, allowing clients to migrate at their own pace.

**Important Considerations for Versioned API Keys:**

*   **Versioning Scheme:**  Choose a clear and consistent versioning scheme (e.g., semantic versioning).
*   **Backward Compatibility:**  Consider the impact of key changes on older API versions.  Strive for backward compatibility whenever possible.
*   **Deprecation Policy:** Define a clear deprecation policy for older key versions.  Communicate the deprecation schedule to clients well in advance.
*   **Monitoring:**  Monitor the usage of each key version to track client migration and identify any potential issues with older versions.

**3. Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):**

Instead of storing API keys directly, store a seed and use a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to generate the actual key on-demand. Rotation involves changing the seed and informing clients. This approach allows for more granular control over key derivation and revocation.

**Pros:**

*   Enhanced security.
*   More control over key generation and revocation.
*   Reduces the risk of storing sensitive keys directly.

**Cons:**

*   More complex to implement.
*   Requires careful selection of KDF parameters.
*   Can introduce performance overhead.

**Conceptual Example (Key Derivation Functions -  Illustrative):**

This is a *simplified* example to illustrate the concept. *Never* use simple hashing algorithms like SHA256 directly for KDFs in production. Use dedicated KDF libraries like `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, or `argon2`.

```python
import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Header
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

# **DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.  USE bcrypt, scrypt, or argon2**
def derive_key(seed: str, version: int) -> str:
    """
    **INSECURE EXAMPLE.  DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.**
    Derives an API key from a seed and version using SHA256.
    """
    data = f"{seed}-{version}".encode("utf-8")
    hashed = hashlib.sha256(data).digest()
    return base64.b64encode(hashed).decode("utf-8")


# Store the seed (ideally in a secure secrets management system)
SEED = "supersecretseed123"  # NEVER hardcode seeds.

CURRENT_VERSION = 1

async def api_key_auth(x_api_key: Optional[str] = Header(None)):
    """
    Authentication dependency to validate the API key.
    """

    if not x_api_key:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="X-API-Key header missing")

    expected_key = derive_key(SEED, CURRENT_VERSION) # Derive the expected key
    if x_api_key != expected_key:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API Key")

    return True


@app.get("/protected-resource", dependencies=[Depends(api_key_auth)])
async def protected_resource():
    """
    A protected endpoint requiring a valid API key.
    """
    return {"message": "Successfully accessed the protected resource!"}


def rotate_seed():
    """
    Simulates the seed rotation process.  Generates a new seed.
    Clients need to be informed to use the new seed and potentially increment the version.
    """
    global SEED, CURRENT_VERSION
    SEED = secrets.token_urlsafe(32) # Create a new random seed
    CURRENT_VERSION += 1
    print(f"Rotated seed.  New Seed (DO NOT LOG IN PRODUCTION): {SEED}, New Version: {CURRENT_VERSION}") # Secure Logging!

# rotate_seed()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

```

**IMPORTANT WARNING:**

*   **This KDF example is for illustrative purposes ONLY.  It is *highly insecure*.  Do not use it in production.**
*   Use established KDF libraries like `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, or `argon2` instead.  These libraries provide strong cryptographic properties and protection against various attacks.
*   **Never store the seed directly in your code.**  Store it securely in a secrets management system.
*   **Consider using a salt with your KDF.**  A salt is a random value that is unique to each key and is used to prevent dictionary attacks.

**Illustrative Example with `bcrypt` (Conceptual):**

```python
import bcrypt
import secrets

def derive_key_bcrypt(seed: str) -> bytes:
    """
    Derives a key using bcrypt (a MUCH MORE SECURE KDF).
    """
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(seed.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    return hashed

SEED = "supersecretseed123" # Secret Management system recommended.
key_hash = derive_key_bcrypt(SEED)

# For verification:

def verify_key_bcrypt(seed: str, key_hash: bytes) -> bool:
    """
    Verifies that a given seed matches the stored key hash.
    """
    return bcrypt.checkpw(seed.encode('utf-8'), key_hash)


if verify_key_bcrypt("supersecretseed123", key_hash):
    print("Key Verified Correctly")
else:
    print("Key Verification Failed")


```

**Important Considerations for Key Derivation Functions:**

*   **KDF Selection:** Choose a strong and well-vetted KDF (bcrypt, scrypt, argon2).
*   **Salt Usage:** Always use a salt with your KDF to prevent dictionary attacks.
*   **Secret Management:** Store the seed securely in a secrets management system.
*   **Performance:**  Consider the performance impact of the KDF, especially for high-volume APIs.
*   **Versioned Seeds:** Use a versioning scheme for your seeds.  This allows you to rotate the seed without invalidating existing keys immediately.  Provide a grace period similar to the simple replacement strategy.

## Best Practices for API Key Rotation

Regardless of the chosen strategy, following these best practices will ensure a smoother and more secure API key rotation process:

*   **Automate the Rotation Process:** Don't rely on manual processes. Automate key generation, distribution, and revocation using scripts, scheduled tasks, or dedicated tools.  Tools like Hashicorp Vault have APIs which you can interact with to automate the distribution process.
*   **Implement Secure Storage:** Store API keys (and especially seeds for KDFs) securely using a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager. Never store keys directly in code or configuration files.
*   **Use Strong Key Generation:** Generate cryptographically strong, random API keys. Use libraries like `secrets` in Python or appropriate cryptographic libraries in other languages.
*   **Monitor Key Usage:** Track the usage of API keys to identify suspicious activity and potential breaches. Implement alerting for unusual patterns.
*   **Log Key Rotations:**  Log all key rotation events for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.  Be careful to log the *event* of rotation, *not* the key itself (log the new key's ID in your database, not the key value).
*   **Implement a Grace Period:**  Provide a grace period during which both the old and new keys are valid to allow clients time to update their applications.
*   **Communicate Effectively:**  Inform clients about upcoming key rotations well in advance. Provide clear instructions on how to update their applications. Offer support during the migration process.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your key rotation process thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying it to production.  Simulate different scenarios and edge cases.
*   **Documentation:** Document the key rotation process, including the strategy used, the key rotation schedule, and the procedures for generating and distributing new keys.

## Example FastAPI Security Scheme

Using a FastAPI security scheme is beneficial as it automatically generates OpenAPI documentation:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Header
from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

# API Key Header definition for documentation
API_KEY_NAME = "X-API-Key"
api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name=API_KEY_NAME, auto_error=True)

# Store API keys (ideally in a database or secrets management system)
API_KEY = "supersecretkey123"  # REMEMBER to store in secrets management

async def get_api_key(api_key_header: str = Depends(api_key_header)):
    """
    Dependency to validate the API key.
    """
    if api_key_header == API_KEY:
        return api_key_header
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API Key")


@app.get("/protected-resource", dependencies=[Depends(get_api_key)])
async def protected_resource():
    """
    A protected endpoint requiring a valid API key.  The securitySchemes section
    in the OpenAPI documentation will automatically include the API key header.
    """
    return {"message": "Successfully accessed the protected resource!"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```
