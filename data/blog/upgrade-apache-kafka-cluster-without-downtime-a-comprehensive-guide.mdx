# Upgrade Apache Kafka Cluster Without Downtime: A Comprehensive Guide

Maintaining a healthy and up-to-date Apache Kafka cluster is crucial for reliable data streaming. However, upgrading a live Kafka cluster can be a daunting task, often associated with potential downtime and data loss. Fortunately, Kafka supports a rolling upgrade strategy, allowing you to upgrade your cluster brokers one at a time without disrupting data flow. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to upgrading your Kafka cluster with zero downtime.

## Why Upgrade Your Kafka Cluster?

Upgrading your Kafka cluster unlocks several benefits:

- **Bug Fixes and Security Patches:** Newer versions often include crucial bug fixes and security patches, mitigating vulnerabilities and improving cluster stability.
- **Performance Improvements:** Each release typically incorporates performance optimizations, leading to faster throughput, reduced latency, and better resource utilization.
- **New Features:** Upgrading provides access to new features and capabilities, enabling you to leverage the latest advancements in Kafka technology.
- **Compatibility:** Maintaining compatibility with newer Kafka clients and other ecosystem components often requires upgrading your brokers.
- **Improved Management and Monitoring:** Newer versions frequently include enhanced monitoring capabilities and management tools, simplifying cluster operations.

## Prerequisites

Before embarking on the upgrade process, ensure you have the following:

- **Backup Strategy:** A robust backup strategy is essential. Consider backing up your Kafka metadata (Zookeeper data) and any critical data stored within Kafka.
- **Monitoring System:** A well-configured monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Kafka Manager) is crucial to track the cluster's health, performance, and any potential issues during the upgrade.
- **Test Environment:** Ideally, have a staging or test environment mirroring your production setup where you can thoroughly test the upgrade process before applying it to the production cluster.
- **Client Compatibility Check:** Verify the compatibility of your Kafka clients (producers and consumers) with the target Kafka version. Newer Kafka versions might introduce changes that require updates to your client applications.
- **Documentation:** Thoroughly review the official Apache Kafka documentation for the target version, paying attention to any specific upgrade instructions or breaking changes.
- **Downtime Tolerance:** While this guide focuses on zero-downtime upgrades, it's crucial to understand your organization's tolerance for potential disruptions, however small.
- **Communication Plan:** Inform relevant stakeholders (developers, operations teams, etc.) about the planned upgrade and its potential impact.

## Step-by-Step Rolling Upgrade Process

Here's a detailed breakdown of the rolling upgrade process:

**1. Pre-Upgrade Checks and Preparations:**

- **Cluster Health Verification:** Ensure your cluster is in a healthy state. Verify that all brokers are running, leader elections are stable, and there are no ongoing issues like under-replicated partitions.
- **Zookeeper Backup:** Back up your Zookeeper data. This is critical for recovering metadata in case of unforeseen issues. You can use `zkCli.sh` to get the data and store it in a file:

  ```plaintext
  ./bin/zkCli.sh -server <zookeeper_host:port> get / > zk_backup.txt
  ```

- **Configuration Review:** Review your Kafka broker configurations, paying close attention to settings related to:
  - `inter.broker.protocol.version`: This configuration is critical for enabling rolling upgrades. It specifies the version of the Kafka protocol used for communication between brokers.
  - `log.message.format.version`: This configuration specifies the message format used in the logs.
  - `offsets.topic.replication.factor`, `transaction.state.log.replication.factor`, `transaction.state.log.min.isr`: Ensure that these are set high enough for fault tolerance, usually to 3.
- **Stop all consumers before upgrade (Optional - only if you need to avoid any message duplication during the upgrade).**: Before starting the upgrade, stop all your consumers.

**2. Updating `inter.broker.protocol.version` (Crucial Step):**

- **Understanding `inter.broker.protocol.version`:** The `inter.broker.protocol.version` configuration is the key to performing rolling upgrades. It allows brokers running different Kafka versions to communicate with each other. This setting needs to be upgraded in two stages.

- **Stage 1: Update `inter.broker.protocol.version` to the highest version supported by your current brokers.**

  - Before upgrading any brokers, set `inter.broker.protocol.version` to the highest version supported by your _current_ Kafka version across _all_ brokers in your cluster. For example, if you are running Kafka 2.8 and upgrading to 3.6, you'd initially set this to 2.8. This ensures backward compatibility during the rolling upgrade.
  - Apply this change to all brokers' `server.properties` file.
  - **Restart all brokers one by one, allowing each to fully restart before proceeding to the next.** This can be done using the following command on each broker:

    ```plaintext
    ./bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
    ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```

  - Monitor your cluster during and after the restart process to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

**3. Upgrade Brokers One at a Time:**

- **Choose a Broker:** Select a broker to upgrade. It's generally recommended to start with a broker that's not a controller or actively serving a high volume of requests.
- **Stop the Broker:** Gracefully shut down the selected broker using the `kafka-server-stop.sh` script:

  ```plaintext
  ./bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
  ```

- **Upgrade the Kafka Software:** Replace the existing Kafka binaries with the binaries of the target version on the selected broker. This usually involves replacing the Kafka installation directory.
- **Update Configuration (if required):** Review the broker's `server.properties` file. Newer Kafka versions may introduce new configuration options or deprecate existing ones. Adjust the configuration file accordingly. Pay attention to configurations that relate to features introduced in the new version. Make sure that all new configurations are compatible with other brokers in the cluster.
- **Start the Broker:** Start the upgraded broker using the `kafka-server-start.sh` script:

  ```plaintext
  ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
  ```

- **Monitor the Broker:** Carefully monitor the newly upgraded broker to ensure it's joining the cluster correctly and functioning as expected. Check the broker's logs for any errors or warnings. Verify that it's able to communicate with other brokers and participate in leader elections. Use your monitoring system to track its performance metrics.
- **Repeat for All Brokers:** Repeat steps 3.1 to 3.5 for each broker in your cluster. **Do this one broker at a time.** Waiting for each broker to fully integrate into the cluster before upgrading the next.
- **Rebalancing (if required):** After upgrading all brokers, consider triggering a rebalance of partitions to ensure optimal data distribution across the cluster. This is often necessary after upgrading multiple brokers. You can use the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` script to perform a rebalance, but this requires careful planning and execution.

**4. Updating `inter.broker.protocol.version` to the target version (Final Step):**

- **Stage 2: Update `inter.broker.protocol.version` to the new version after all brokers have been upgraded.**

  - Once _all_ brokers in your cluster have been upgraded to the target Kafka version, you can update `inter.broker.protocol.version` to the target version (e.g., 3.6 if you upgraded to Kafka 3.6).
  - Update the `server.properties` file on _all_ brokers with the new `inter.broker.protocol.version`.
  - **Restart all brokers one by one, allowing each to fully restart before proceeding to the next.**

    ```plaintext
    ./bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
    ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```

  - After this final restart, your cluster will be fully upgraded and operating at the new Kafka version. You can now leverage any new features and optimizations.

**5. Update `log.message.format.version` (Optional but recommended):**

- Once all brokers have been upgraded and `inter.broker.protocol.version` has been updated, you can also upgrade `log.message.format.version` to the latest version supported. This enables the latest message format features.
- **Important:** Changing `log.message.format.version` requires careful consideration. If you have older consumers that do not support the new message format, they will no longer be able to read messages from the upgraded topic. Ensure all consumers are compatible before making this change.
- You can upgrade the `log.message.format.version` on a per-topic basis using the `kafka-configs.sh` script:

  ```plaintext
  ./bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper <zookeeper_host:port> --alter --entity-type topics --entity-name <topic_name> --add-config log.message.format.version=<target_version>
  ```

  - For example, to upgrade the message format version of the topic "my-topic" to 3.6:

    ```plaintext
    ./bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic --add-config log.message.format.version=3.6
    ```

**6. Post-Upgrade Verification:**

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of your applications and data pipelines to ensure they are functioning correctly after the upgrade.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Closely monitor your cluster's performance metrics (throughput, latency, CPU utilization, memory usage) to identify any performance regressions.
- **Log Analysis:** Analyze the broker logs for any errors, warnings, or unusual activity.
- **Client Compatibility:** Verify that all your Kafka clients are compatible with the new Kafka version and are functioning as expected.

## Best Practices for Zero-Downtime Upgrades

- **Automate the Process:** Automate as much of the upgrade process as possible using scripting or configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet). This reduces the risk of human error and ensures consistency.
- **Gradual Rollout:** Consider a gradual rollout of the upgrade, starting with a small subset of brokers and gradually expanding to the entire cluster.
- **Monitoring is Key:** Continuous monitoring is critical throughout the upgrade process. Use your monitoring system to track key metrics and identify any potential issues.
- **Rollback Plan:** Have a well-defined rollback plan in case the upgrade fails. This should include steps to revert the changes and restore the cluster to its previous state.
- **Document Everything:** Thoroughly document the upgrade process, including all configuration changes, commands executed, and any issues encountered. This will be invaluable for future upgrades.
- **Stagger Broker Restarts**: When restarting brokers, allow enough time for the broker to rejoin the cluster and stabilize before restarting the next one. This reduces the impact on the cluster during the upgrade.
- **Avoid Simultaneous Actions:** Avoid performing other maintenance tasks or configuration changes during the upgrade process. This minimizes the risk of conflicts or unexpected issues.

## Potential Challenges and Troubleshooting

- **Broker Incompatibility:** Ensure that all brokers are running compatible versions of Kafka during the rolling upgrade.
- **Configuration Errors:** Incorrectly configured brokers can cause issues during the upgrade. Double-check all configuration files.
- **Network Connectivity:** Network issues can disrupt communication between brokers. Verify network connectivity between all brokers.
- **Resource Constraints:** Insufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space) can lead to performance issues or failures during the upgrade. Monitor resource utilization.
- **Zookeeper Issues:** Zookeeper is critical for Kafka's operation. Any issues with Zookeeper can disrupt the upgrade process. Monitor Zookeeper health.
