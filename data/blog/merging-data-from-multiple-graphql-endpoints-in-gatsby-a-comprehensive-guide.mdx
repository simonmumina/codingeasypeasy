# Merging Data from Multiple GraphQL Endpoints in Gatsby: A Comprehensive Guide

Gatsby is a powerful static site generator that leverages React and GraphQL to create blazing-fast websites. Often, the data you need for your site isn't located in a single source. You might have data residing in a CMS, a third-party API, and your own custom GraphQL endpoint. This article provides a detailed guide on how to seamlessly merge data from multiple GraphQL endpoints into your Gatsby site.

## Why Merge GraphQL Endpoints in Gatsby?

Before diving into the implementation, let's explore why merging GraphQL endpoints is beneficial:

- **Centralized Data Access:** Consolidate data from various sources into a single GraphQL schema within your Gatsby project. This simplifies querying and management.
- **Enhanced Data Consistency:** Ensure data across different sources is consistent by merging and transforming it as needed.
- **Improved Development Workflow:** Streamline your development process by accessing all your data through a unified interface.
- **Faster Build Times:** By strategically managing data fetching, you can optimize your build times and improve site performance.
- **Flexibility:** Adapt your site to different data sources without major code changes.

## Method 1: Using `gatsby-source-graphql`

The most straightforward and common way to merge GraphQL data in Gatsby is using the `gatsby-source-graphql` plugin. This plugin allows you to pull data from any GraphQL API and make it available in your Gatsby GraphQL schema.

### Installation

First, install the plugin:

```plaintext
npm install gatsby-source-graphql
```

### Configuration

Add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` file. You'll need to configure each GraphQL endpoint as a separate source.

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
      options: {
        typeName: `CMS`, // Unique type name for this source
        fieldName: `cmsData`, // Name under which the data will be available in GraphQL
        url: `https://your-cms-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql`,
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_CMS_API_TOKEN`, // Optional: Authentication headers
        },
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
      options: {
        typeName: `API`, // Unique type name for this source
        fieldName: `apiData`, // Name under which the data will be available in GraphQL
        url: `https://your-external-api.com/graphql`,
        // Optional: Fetch options
        fetchOptions: {
          mode: 'cors',
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `typeName`: A unique name you assign to each GraphQL source. This prevents naming conflicts. Choose descriptive names like `CMS`, `API`, or `Blog`.
- `fieldName`: The name under which the data from this source will be accessible in your Gatsby GraphQL schema. For example, if `fieldName` is `cmsData`, you'll access the data via `allCmsData`.
- `url`: The URL of your GraphQL endpoint.
- `headers`: Optional. Add any required headers for authentication or authorization. Common headers include `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, and `X-API-Key`.
- `fetchOptions`: Optional. Allows you to customize the `fetch` API call used by `gatsby-source-graphql`. Useful for setting `mode: 'cors'` to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.

### Querying Merged Data

After configuring the plugins, you can query the merged data in your Gatsby components using GraphQL.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'

const IndexPage = ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data) // Inspect the data object in your browser's console
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data from CMS</h1>
      {data.cmsData.allPosts.nodes.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </div>
      ))}

      <h1>Data from API</h1>
      {data.apiData.allProducts.nodes.map((product) => (
        <div key={product.id}>
          <h2>{product.name}</h2>
          <p>${product.price}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    cmsData {
      allPosts {
        nodes {
          id
          title
          excerpt
        }
      }
    }
    apiData {
      allProducts {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          price
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

export default IndexPage
```

**Explanation:**

- The `graphql` tag allows you to write GraphQL queries directly within your components.
- The query accesses the data through the `fieldName` you defined in `gatsby-config.js`. For example, `cmsData.allPosts` accesses the `allPosts` query from the GraphQL endpoint configured with the `cmsData` field name.
- Inspect the `data` object in your browser's console to understand the structure of the fetched data and how to access it.

### Addressing Schema Conflicts

If your GraphQL endpoints have overlapping type names or field names, you'll encounter schema conflicts. `gatsby-source-graphql` provides several options to resolve these conflicts:

- **`typeName`:** The most basic way to avoid conflicts is to ensure each source has a unique `typeName`. This isolates the schemas.
- **`fieldName`:** Similarly, ensure each source has a unique `fieldName`. This controls how the data is exposed in your Gatsby GraphQL schema.
- **Schema Customization:** Use Gatsby's schema customization APIs ( `createSchemaCustomization` in `gatsby-node.js`) to rename, ignore, or transform types and fields. This is the most powerful and flexible way to handle conflicts.

**Example of Schema Customization (gatsby-node.js):**

```plaintext
exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes } = actions

  const typeDefs = `
    type CMS_Post implements Node @dontInfer {
      id: ID!
      title: String
      excerpt: String
    }

    type API_Product implements Node @dontInfer {
      id: ID!
      productName: String @proxy(from: "name") # Rename the 'name' field from the API to 'productName'
      price: Float
    }
  `

  createTypes(typeDefs)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `@dontInfer`: Prevents Gatsby from automatically inferring the schema, allowing you to define it explicitly.
- `@proxy`: Allows you to rename fields from the source GraphQL API. In the example above, the `name` field from the API is renamed to `productName`.
- `createTypes` takes an array of type definitions written in GraphQL schema language.

## Method 2: Using a GraphQL Gateway (e.g., Netlify Functions)

For more complex scenarios, such as when you need to perform advanced data transformations, implement custom authentication logic, or combine data from non-GraphQL sources, consider using a GraphQL gateway. A GraphQL gateway acts as a single point of entry for your data, aggregating and transforming data from multiple sources before exposing it to your Gatsby site.

### Creating a Netlify Function as a GraphQL Gateway

This example uses Netlify Functions, but you can use other serverless functions platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

1.  **Set up a Netlify site:** If you don't have one already, create a Netlify site for your Gatsby project.

2.  **Create a `functions` directory:** Create a directory named `functions` in your project root.

3.  **Create a Netlify Function:** Create a JavaScript file inside the `functions` directory (e.g., `functions/graphql.js`). This file will contain your Netlify Function.

4.  **Install necessary packages:** You'll need packages like `apollo-server-lambda` and `graphql`.

    ```plaintext
    npm install apollo-server-lambda graphql node-fetch
    ```

    (Node-fetch is used to make calls to other GraphQL APIs).

5.  **Implement the GraphQL Gateway Logic:**

```plaintext
// functions/graphql.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-lambda')
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

const CMS_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-cms-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql'
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-external-api.com/graphql'

// Define types based on what you want to expose
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String
    excerpt: String
  }

  type Product {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    price: Float
  }

  type Query {
    allPosts: [Post]
    allProducts: [Product]
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    allPosts: async () => {
      const res = await fetch(CMS_ENDPOINT, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ query: `{ allPosts { nodes { id title excerpt } } }` }),
      })
      const data = await res.json()
      return data.data.allPosts.nodes
    },
    allProducts: async () => {
      const res = await fetch(API_ENDPOINT, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ query: `{ allProducts { nodes { id name price } } }` }),
      })
      const data = await res.json()
      return data.data.allProducts.nodes
    },
  },
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
})

exports.handler = server.createHandler({
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
    methods: 'GET,HEAD,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS',
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`apollo-server-lambda`:** Provides the GraphQL server implementation for Netlify Functions.
- **`typeDefs`:** Defines the GraphQL schema that your gateway will expose. This schema combines types and fields from your different data sources. You may want to rename fields or types to make them more intuitive.
- **`resolvers`:** Implements the logic for resolving GraphQL queries. In this example, the `allPosts` resolver fetches data from the CMS GraphQL endpoint, and the `allProducts` resolver fetches data from the API GraphQL endpoint. You can modify the fetched data before returning it.
- **`cors`:** Configure CORS to allow requests from your Gatsby site. Set `origin` to `*` for development, but restrict it to your Gatsby site's domain in production for security.

6.  **Configure Netlify to Deploy Functions:** In your `netlify.toml` file, specify the functions directory:

```toml
[build]
  functions = "functions"
```

7.  **Deploy to Netlify:** Deploy your Gatsby site and the Netlify Function to Netlify.

### Using the Gateway in Gatsby

Now, use `gatsby-source-graphql` to connect to your Netlify Function's GraphQL endpoint.

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
      options: {
        typeName: `Gateway`, // Unique type name for this source
        fieldName: `gatewayData`, // Name under which the data will be available in GraphQL
        url: `/.netlify/functions/graphql`, // URL of your Netlify Function
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**Query the Gateway Data:**

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'

const IndexPage = ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data)
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data from Gateway</h1>
      {data.gatewayData.allPosts.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </div>
      ))}

      {data.gatewayData.allProducts.map((product) => (
        <div key={product.id}>
          <h2>{product.name}</h2>
          <p>${product.price}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    gatewayData {
      allPosts {
        id
        title
        excerpt
      }
      allProducts {
        id
        name
        price
      }
    }
  }
`

export default IndexPage
```
