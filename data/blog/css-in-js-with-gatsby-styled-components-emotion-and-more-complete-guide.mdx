# CSS-in-JS with Gatsby: Styled-Components, Emotion, and More (Complete Guide)

Gatsby, the blazing-fast static site generator for React, provides a powerful and flexible environment for building websites. When it comes to styling your Gatsby projects, you have several options, ranging from traditional CSS stylesheets to more modern approaches like CSS-in-JS. This article will dive deep into CSS-in-JS within the Gatsby ecosystem, focusing on popular libraries like styled-components and Emotion, exploring their benefits, drawbacks, and practical implementation.

## What is CSS-in-JS?

CSS-in-JS is a technique for writing CSS styles directly within your JavaScript code. Instead of managing separate CSS files, you define styles using JavaScript objects or tagged template literals, allowing you to leverage the full power of JavaScript for styling. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Component-Scoped Styling:** Styles are encapsulated within individual components, preventing naming conflicts and ensuring that styles apply only where intended.
- **Dynamic Styling:** You can dynamically adjust styles based on component props, state, or context, creating highly adaptable and interactive UI elements.
- **Dead Code Elimination:** Unused styles are automatically removed during the build process, leading to smaller CSS bundles and improved performance.
- **Improved Collaboration:** Styles are co-located with the component logic, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.
- **Theming:** CSS-in-JS libraries often provide robust theming capabilities, allowing you to easily switch between different visual styles for your application.

## Why Use CSS-in-JS with Gatsby?

While Gatsby supports traditional CSS, using CSS-in-JS offers specific advantages for Gatsby projects:

- **Performance Optimization:** Gatsby automatically extracts critical CSS during the build process, ensuring that your pages load quickly. CSS-in-JS libraries can be optimized to work seamlessly with Gatsby's performance features.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Compatibility:** CSS-in-JS libraries are designed to work well with SSR, ensuring that your styles are rendered correctly on the server and delivered to the client.
- **Developer Experience:** Writing styles in JavaScript can be more intuitive and efficient for developers who are already familiar with JavaScript.
- **Integration with Gatsby Plugins:** Many Gatsby plugins are designed to work well with CSS-in-JS, offering additional features and optimizations.

## Popular CSS-in-JS Libraries for Gatsby

Here are two of the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries for use with Gatsby:

### 1. Styled-Components

Styled-components is a highly popular CSS-in-JS library that uses tagged template literals to define styles. It provides a clean and declarative syntax for creating styled components.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install styled-components gatsby-plugin-styled-components
```

**Configuration in `gatsby-config.js`:**

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-styled-components`],
}
```

**Usage:**

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? 'palevioletred' : 'white')};
  color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? 'white' : 'palevioletred')};

  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: lightpink;
    color: white;
  }
`

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <StyledButton>Normal Button</StyledButton>
      <StyledButton primary>Primary Button</StyledButton>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `styled` from the `styled-components` library.
- We use `styled.button` to create a styled button component. You can replace `button` with any valid HTML tag or React component.
- We use tagged template literals (backticks ``) to define the CSS styles.
- We can access props within the styles using template literals (e.g., `${props => props.primary ? 'palevioletred' : 'white'}`).
- We can use CSS selectors like `:hover` to define pseudo-class styles.

**Theming with Styled-Components:**

Styled-components provides a `ThemeProvider` component that allows you to define a theme and make it available to all styled components within your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

const theme = {
  primaryColor: 'teal',
  secondaryColor: 'tomato',
  fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
}

const StyledHeading = styled.h1`
  color: ${(props) => props.theme.primaryColor};
  font-family: ${(props) => props.theme.fontFamily};
`

const StyledParagraph = styled.p`
  color: ${(props) => props.theme.secondaryColor};
  font-family: ${(props) => props.theme.fontFamily};
`

const MyThemedComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <div>
        <StyledHeading>Styled Heading</StyledHeading>
        <StyledParagraph>Styled Paragraph</StyledParagraph>
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default MyThemedComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `ThemeProvider` from `styled-components`.
- We define a `theme` object that contains the styles we want to share across our application.
- We wrap our components with the `ThemeProvider` component and pass the `theme` object as a prop.
- We can access the theme values within our styled components using `props.theme`.

### 2. Emotion

Emotion is another popular CSS-in-JS library that offers similar features to styled-components. It provides a flexible and performant solution for styling React components. Emotion focuses heavily on performance and offers a more lightweight solution.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled gatsby-plugin-emotion
```

**Configuration in `gatsby-config.js`:**

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-emotion`],
}
```

**Usage:**

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? 'palevioletred' : 'white')};
  color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? 'white' : 'palevioletred')};

  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid palevioletred;
  border-radius: 3px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: lightpink;
    color: white;
  }
`

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <StyledButton>Normal Button</StyledButton>
      <StyledButton primary>Primary Button</StyledButton>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

The usage is very similar to styled-components. The primary difference is the import statement: `import styled from '@emotion/styled';`

**Theming with Emotion:**

Emotion uses React's Context API for theming. You can use the `ThemeProvider` component from `@emotion/react`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from '@emotion/styled'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react'

const theme = {
  primaryColor: 'teal',
  secondaryColor: 'tomato',
  fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
}

const StyledHeading = styled.h1`
  color: ${(props) => props.theme.primaryColor};
  font-family: ${(props) => props.theme.fontFamily};
`

const StyledParagraph = styled.p`
  color: ${(props) => props.theme.secondaryColor};
  font-family: ${(props) => props.theme.fontFamily};
`

const MyThemedComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <div>
        <StyledHeading>Styled Heading</StyledHeading>
        <StyledParagraph>Styled Paragraph</StyledParagraph>
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default MyThemedComponent
```

The theming implementation is also largely the same as Styled Components, utilizing the `ThemeProvider`.

### Choosing Between Styled-Components and Emotion
