# ROW_NUMBER() vs RANK() vs DENSE_RANK() in SQL: Understanding the Differences with Examples

When working with data in SQL, you often need to rank rows within a result set based on specific criteria. SQL provides several window functions for this purpose, with `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` being the most common. While they all achieve a form of ranking, they behave differently, leading to different results. Understanding these differences is crucial for choosing the right function to achieve the desired outcome. This post will provide a comprehensive breakdown of each function with clear examples to illustrate their behavior.

## What are Window Functions?

Before diving into the specifics, let's briefly define window functions. Unlike aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`) that operate on groups of rows and return a single value per group, window functions operate on a set of rows (a "window") related to the current row. They calculate a value for each row based on the rows within the window, without collapsing rows into a single output. This is extremely useful for calculations involving relative positions and rankings.

The general syntax for a window function is:

```sql
window_function(arguments) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
  ORDER BY column3 [ASC | DESC], ...
  [ROWS | RANGE BETWEEN start AND end]
)
```

- **`window_function()`**: The specific window function you're using (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`).
- **`OVER()`**: This keyword indicates that we're using a window function.
- **`PARTITION BY`**: Divides the result set into partitions. The window function is applied to each partition independently. Think of it as applying the ranking within each group.
- **`ORDER BY`**: Specifies the order of rows within each partition. This is crucial for determining the rank.
- **`ROWS | RANGE BETWEEN`**: Defines the window frame, which is a set of rows relative to the current row. We won't focus on `ROWS` and `RANGE` extensively in this post, but they allow for more complex window definitions.

## 1. ROW_NUMBER(): Assigning Unique Sequential Ranks

`ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique, sequential integer to each row within a partition, based on the order specified in the `ORDER BY` clause. It doesn't consider ties. Even if multiple rows have the same value in the `ORDER BY` column(s), they will receive different rank numbers.

**Key Characteristics of `ROW_NUMBER()`:**

- **Uniqueness:** Always assigns unique rank numbers.
- **Sequential:** The rank numbers are sequential (1, 2, 3, ...).
- **Ignores Ties:** Does not account for ties in the `ORDER BY` column(s).

**Example:**

Let's imagine a table called `Employees` with the following data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(255),
    Department VARCHAR(255),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice Smith', 'Sales', 60000.00),
(2, 'Bob Johnson', 'Sales', 75000.00),
(3, 'Charlie Brown', 'Marketing', 55000.00),
(4, 'David Lee', 'Marketing', 55000.00),
(5, 'Eve Wilson', 'Engineering', 80000.00),
(6, 'Frank Davis', 'Engineering', 90000.00);
```

Now, let's use `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank employees within each department based on their salary:

```sql
SELECT
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum
FROM
    Employees;
```

**Output:**

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName  | Department  | Salary   | RowNum |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| 5          | Eve Wilson    | Engineering | 80000.00 | 1      |
| 6          | Frank Davis   | Engineering | 90000.00 | 2      |
| 3          | Charlie Brown | Marketing   | 55000.00 | 1      |
| 4          | David Lee     | Marketing   | 55000.00 | 2      |
| 2          | Bob Johnson   | Sales       | 75000.00 | 1      |
| 1          | Alice Smith   | Sales       | 60000.00 | 2      |

**Explanation:**

- `PARTITION BY Department` divides the employees into groups based on their department.
- `ORDER BY Salary DESC` orders the employees within each department by salary in descending order (highest salary first).
- `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique rank to each employee within their department based on the salary order. Notice that even though Charlie Brown and David Lee have the same salary, they receive different `RowNum` values (1 and 2). The specific order between them is determined by the database engine and isn't guaranteed to be consistent unless you add more tie-breaking criteria to the `ORDER BY` clause.

## 2. RANK(): Handling Ties with Gaps in Rank Numbers

`RANK()` assigns a rank to each row within a partition based on the order specified in the `ORDER BY` clause. It handles ties by assigning the same rank to all tied rows. The next rank number is then skipped, creating a gap in the sequence.

**Key Characteristics of `RANK()`:**

- **Handles Ties:** Assigns the same rank to rows with equal values in the `ORDER BY` column(s).
- **Gaps in Rank:** Skips rank numbers after a tie.
- **Non-Unique:** May assign the same rank to multiple rows.

**Example:**

Using the same `Employees` table, let's use `RANK()` to rank employees within each department based on their salary:

```sql
SELECT
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
FROM
    Employees;
```

**Output:**

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName  | Department  | Salary   | Rank |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---- |
| 5          | Eve Wilson    | Engineering | 80000.00 | 2    |
| 6          | Frank Davis   | Engineering | 90000.00 | 1    |
| 3          | Charlie Brown | Marketing   | 55000.00 | 1    |
| 4          | David Lee     | Marketing   | 55000.00 | 1    |
| 2          | Bob Johnson   | Sales       | 75000.00 | 1    |
| 1          | Alice Smith   | Sales       | 60000.00 | 2    |

**Explanation:**

- The `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses remain the same.
- `RANK()` assigns the same rank (1) to both Charlie Brown and David Lee because they have the same salary in the Marketing department.
- The next rank assigned in the Marketing department is skipped to '3' _if another employee had a salary less than 55000_. However, in this case, there are only two employees so this skipping is not shown in the dataset.

## 3. DENSE_RANK(): Handling Ties Without Gaps in Rank Numbers

`DENSE_RANK()` is similar to `RANK()`, but it assigns consecutive rank numbers, even when there are ties. It handles ties by assigning the same rank to all tied rows, but unlike `RANK()`, it does _not_ skip the next rank number.

**Key Characteristics of `DENSE_RANK()`:**

- **Handles Ties:** Assigns the same rank to rows with equal values in the `ORDER BY` column(s).
- **No Gaps in Rank:** Does not skip rank numbers after a tie.
- **Non-Unique:** May assign the same rank to multiple rows.

**Example:**

Using the same `Employees` table, let's use `DENSE_RANK()` to rank employees within each department based on their salary:

```sql
SELECT
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM
    Employees;
```

**Output:**

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName  | Department  | Salary   | DenseRank |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| 5          | Eve Wilson    | Engineering | 80000.00 | 2         |
| 6          | Frank Davis   | Engineering | 90000.00 | 1         |
| 3          | Charlie Brown | Marketing   | 55000.00 | 1         |
| 4          | David Lee     | Marketing   | 55000.00 | 1         |
| 2          | Bob Johnson   | Sales       | 75000.00 | 1         |
| 1          | Alice Smith   | Sales       | 60000.00 | 2         |

**Explanation:**

- The `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses remain the same.
- `DENSE_RANK()` assigns the same rank (1) to both Charlie Brown and David Lee because they have the same salary in the Marketing department.
- The next rank assigned in the Marketing department is `2`, _not_ `3` like in the `RANK()` example. `DENSE_RANK()` doesn't skip rank numbers.

## Summary Table: ROW_NUMBER() vs. RANK() vs. DENSE_RANK()

| Feature         | ROW_NUMBER() | RANK()    | DENSE_RANK() |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Uniqueness      | Yes          | No        | No           |
| Sequential      | Yes          | No (Gaps) | Yes          |
| Handles Ties    | No           | Yes       | Yes          |
| Gaps in Ranking | No           | Yes       | No           |

## Choosing the Right Function

The choice between `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` depends on your specific requirements:

- **`ROW_NUMBER()`**: Use this when you need a unique, sequential rank for each row, regardless of ties. For example, if you need to select the first N rows based on a particular criteria, even if some rows have the same value.
- **`RANK()`**: Use this when you want to account for ties and want to reflect those ties in the ranking by assigning the same rank to equal values. The skipped rank numbers can be useful to understand the relative density of values.
- **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Use this when you want to account for ties but still have consecutive rank numbers without gaps. This is often useful when you need to summarize how many distinct ranks exist.

## Practical Use Cases

- **Finding the Top N Performers:** Using `ROW_NUMBER()` after ordering by sales to select the top 5 sales representatives.
- **Identifying Medal Winners in a Competition:** Using `RANK()` to assign the same rank to multiple athletes who tie for a position (e.g., two athletes getting a shared silver medal).
- **Calculating Percentiles:** Using `NTILE()` (another related window function) to divide the data into percentile groups. While not directly `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK` or `DENSE_RANK`, it follows the same `OVER()` syntax and is a common alternative.

## Conclusion

Understanding the nuances of `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` is essential for writing efficient and accurate SQL queries. By carefully considering the characteristics of each function, you can choose the right one to meet your specific ranking needs and gain valuable insights from your data. Remember to consider the impact of ties and whether you need unique ranks or gaps in the ranking sequence. Experiment with these functions and different datasets to further solidify your understanding.
