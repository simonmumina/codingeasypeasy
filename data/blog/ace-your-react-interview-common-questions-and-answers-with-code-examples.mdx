# Ace Your React Interview: Common Questions and Answers with Code Examples

Landing a React developer job often requires navigating a technical interview process filled with challenging questions.  This guide provides a comprehensive overview of common React interview questions, covering fundamental concepts, best practices, and problem-solving scenarios.  We'll not only present the questions but also dive into detailed explanations and provide practical code examples to help you showcase your React expertise.

## Fundamentals

### 1. What is React?

**Why it's asked:** This is a foundational question to gauge your understanding of React's core purpose.

**Answer:**  React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage application state efficiently. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates to the actual DOM, resulting in improved performance.

### 2. What are the key features of React?

**Why it's asked:**  Demonstrates your understanding of React's core strengths.

**Answer:** Key features include:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:**  UI is broken down into reusable and independent components.
*   **Virtual DOM:** Minimizes direct DOM manipulation for faster rendering.
*   **JSX (JavaScript XML):** Allows writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.
*   **One-Way Data Binding:** Data flows in a single direction, making it easier to manage and debug.
*   **React Hooks:** Enables using state and other React features in functional components.
*   **Large and Active Community:** Access to a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and support.

### 3. What is JSX?

**Why it's asked:**  Tests your understanding of a fundamental part of React syntax.

**Answer:** JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code. It's not HTML itself but gets transformed into regular JavaScript calls to `React.createElement()` which then creates the DOM elements.

**Example:**

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This JSX code is equivalent to:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

### 4. What is the Virtual DOM? How does it work?

**Why it's asked:** Checks your understanding of React's performance optimization techniques.

**Answer:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When data changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first.  Then, it compares the Virtual DOM with its previous state and calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM.  This process is called "diffing."  By only updating the parts of the DOM that have changed, React significantly improves performance.

### 5. What are React components? Differentiate between functional and class components.

**Why it's asked:** Assesses your understanding of React's building blocks and the differences between component types.

**Answer:** React components are independent, reusable pieces of UI. There are two main types:

*   **Functional Components:**  These are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return JSX. They are typically used for presentational logic.  With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also manage state and lifecycle effects.

*   **Class Components:**  These are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They have a `render()` method that returns JSX.  They can manage state using `this.state` and handle lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`.

**Example (Functional Component with Hooks):**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyFunctionalComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyFunctionalComponent;
```

**Example (Class Component):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyClassComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  incrementCount = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyClassComponent;
```

### 6. What are props in React?

**Why it's asked:**  A fundamental concept for passing data between components.

**Answer:** Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component.  Props are read-only within the child component; a child component cannot directly modify the props it receives. This helps maintain a clear data flow.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Parent Component
function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <ChildComponent name="Alice" age={30} />
  );
}

// Child Component
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 7. What is state in React? How is it different from props?

**Why it's asked:**  Distinguishes your understanding of data management within components.

**Answer:** State is data that is managed within a component. It represents the internal data of a component that can change over time, triggering re-renders.

**Key Differences between State and Props:**

| Feature         | State                                | Props                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Ownership       | Owned and managed by the component.  | Passed down from parent component.     |
| Mutability      | Mutable (can be changed).            | Immutable (read-only within the child). |
| Data Flow       | Local to the component.             | Passed from parent to child.           |

### 8. Explain the component lifecycle methods in React.

**Why it's asked:**  Tests your understanding of how components are rendered, updated, and unmounted.

**Answer:**  (Focus on the common ones.  Less focus on the deprecated ones.  Mention the modern replacements)

**Common Lifecycle Methods (Class Components):**

*   **`constructor(props)`:**  Initializes the component.  Used for setting initial state and binding event handlers.
*   **`render()`:**  Required method that returns the JSX to be rendered. This method should be pure and not modify the component's state directly.
*   **`componentDidMount()`:** Invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the DOM).  Commonly used for fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or interacting with the DOM directly.
*   **`componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`:**  Invoked immediately after an update occurs.  You can perform side effects here based on the previous and current props/state.  Remember to compare `prevProps` and `this.props` (or `prevState` and `this.state`) to avoid infinite loops.
*   **`componentWillUnmount()`:**  Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.  Used for cleaning up resources, such as timers, subscriptions, and event listeners.

**Modern Alternative (Functional Components with Hooks):**

Lifecycle methods are largely replaced by the `useEffect` hook in functional components. `useEffect` can handle mounting, updating, and unmounting logic.

**Example (useEffect):**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This effect runs after every render
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;

    // Cleanup function (runs on unmount and before re-running the effect)
    return () => {
      document.title = 'React App'; // Reset title on unmount
    };
  }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if 'count' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Explanation of `useEffect`:**

*   The first argument to `useEffect` is a function containing the effect logic.
*   The second argument is an optional array of dependencies. React will only re-run the effect when one of the dependencies changes.
*   If you pass an empty array `[]` as the dependency array, the effect will only run once after the initial render (similar to `componentDidMount`).
*   The function can optionally return a cleanup function that runs when the component unmounts or before the effect runs again.

### 9. What are React Hooks? Why are they used?

**Why it's asked:**  Tests your knowledge of modern React development practices.

**Answer:** React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and provide a more concise and reusable way to manage state and side effects without using class components.

**Why use Hooks?**

*   **Reusability:**  Hooks make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components.
*   **Readability:**  Functional components with Hooks are often more concise and easier to read than class components.
*   **Logic Organization:** Hooks allow you to group related logic together within a component.
*   **Avoid Class Component Complexity:**  Class components can become complex and difficult to manage as they grow. Hooks provide a more straightforward alternative.

**Common Hooks:**

*   `useState`:  For managing state within functional components.
*   `useEffect`:  For performing side effects (data fetching, DOM manipulation, subscriptions).
*   `useContext`:  For accessing the React context.
*   `useReducer`:  For managing complex state logic.
*   `useCallback`:  For memoizing functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
*   `useMemo`:  For memoizing expensive calculations.
*   `useRef`: For creating persistent references.
*   `useImperativeHandle`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useDebugValue` (Less common, but good to be aware of their existence).

### 10. Explain `useState` hook.

**Why it's asked:**  Tests your knowledge of the most fundamental React Hook.

**Answer:** The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array containing two elements:

*   The current state value.
*   A function to update the state value.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state is 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### 11. Explain `useEffect` hook.

**Why it's asked:** Tests your knowledge of how to perform side effects in functional components. (See answer above for question #8, including the comprehensive example).  Focus on dependency array and cleanup functions.

### 12. What is the purpose of the `useContext` hook?

**Why it's asked:** Tests your understanding of how to manage global state or shared data.

**Answer:** The `useContext` hook provides a way to access the value of a React context within a functional component. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This is particularly useful for sharing data that is considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Create a context
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext('light'); // Default theme

// Provider component
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(prevTheme => prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
  };

  const value = {
    theme,
    toggleTheme,
  };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Consuming component
function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? 'white' : 'black', color: theme === 'light' ? 'black' : 'white' }}>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage in App.js (or your root component)
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <MyComponent />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 13. Explain the use cases for `useReducer` hook.

**Why it's asked:**  Tests your knowledge of advanced state management techniques.

**Answer:** The `useReducer` hook is an alternative to `useState` for managing complex state logic. It's particularly useful when:

*   The next state depends on the previous state.
*   You have multiple sub-values that need to be updated.
*   State updates are complex and involve multiple actions.

`useReducer` works by dispatching actions to a reducer function, which then calculates the new state based on the current state and the action. This pattern is similar to Redux.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

// Reducer function
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Initial state
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function MyComponent() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### 14. What is the purpose of `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks?

**Why it's asked:** Tests your understanding of performance optimization techniques with hooks.

**Answer:** Both `useCallback` and `useMemo` are used for performance optimization by memoizing values.

*   **`useCallback(fn, deps)`:** Returns a *memoized* version of the callback function `fn` that only changes if one of the dependencies in `deps` has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on referential equality to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  If no dependencies are provided, a new callback is created on every render.

*   **`useMemo(fn, deps)`:** Returns a *memoized* value.  Only recomputes the value when one of the dependencies in `deps` has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render if the inputs haven't changed. If no dependencies are provided, a new value is computed on every render.

**Example (useCallback):**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Memoize the handleClick function
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Re-create only when 'count' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <MyComponent onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

**Example (useMemo):**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [a, setA] = useState(1);
  const [b, setB] = useState(2);

  // Memoize the calculation
  const result = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating...'); // This will only log when a or b changes
    return a * b;
  }, [a, b]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>a: {a}</p>
      <p>b: {b}</p>
      <p>Result: {result}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setA(a + 1)}>Increment A</button>
      <button onClick={() => setB(b + 1)}>Increment B</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### 15. What is the purpose of `useRef` hook?

**Why it's asked:**  Tests your understanding of how to access DOM elements or persist values between renders.

**Answer:** The `useRef` hook provides a way to create a mutable reference that persists across renders. It's primarily used for:

*   **Accessing DOM elements directly:** You can attach a ref to a DOM element and access its properties and methods.
*   **Storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders:** Unlike state, changing the value of a ref doesn't cause the component to re-render. This is useful for storing values that you want to persist between renders but don't need to display in the UI.

**Example (Accessing DOM Element):**

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Focus the input element after the component mounts
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Example (Persisting Value without Re-render):**

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const previousCountRef = useRef(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    previousCountRef.current = count; // Store the previous count
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Previous Count: {previousCountRef.current}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Data Handling and Communication

### 16. What is lifting state up in React? Why is it important?

**Why it's asked:**  Demonstrates your understanding of how to share state between components.

**Answer:** Lifting state up is a technique in React where you move the state from a child component to a common ancestor component. This allows the ancestor component to control the state and pass it down as props to the child components that need it.

**Why is it important?**

*   **Shared State:**  Enables multiple components to access and modify the same state.
*   **Controlled Components:**  Makes components more predictable and easier to manage because the parent component controls their behavior.
*   **Single Source of Truth:**  Ensures that the state is managed in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ChildA({ value, onChange }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={onChange} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildB({ value }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Value from Input: {value}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function ParentComponent() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildA value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
      <ChildB value={inputValue} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

### 17. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

**Why it's asked:** Tests your understanding of different approaches to handling form data.

**Answer:**

*   **Controlled Components:** The component's state is controlled by React.  The value of the input element is stored in the component's state, and the `onChange` event handler updates the state whenever the input value changes.  This gives React complete control over the input's value.

*   **Uncontrolled Components:** The component's state is not controlled by React. The input element stores its own value internally, and you can access the value using a ref. This is similar to how traditional HTML form elements work.

**Example (Controlled Component):**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledInput() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />
  );
}

export default ControlledInput;
```

**Example (Uncontrolled Component):**

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('Input Value:', inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledInput;
```

### 18. What are fragments in React? Why are they used?

**Why it's asked:**  Checks your knowledge of returning multiple elements from a component.

**Answer:** Fragments are a way to group multiple React elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. They are useful when you need to return multiple elements from a component's render method, but you don't want to introduce an unnecessary parent element.

**Why use Fragments?**

*   **Cleaner DOM:** Avoids adding extra DOM nodes, which can improve performance and simplify the DOM structure.
*   **Valid JSX:**  Ensures that your component returns a single root element, as required by JSX.

**Syntax:**

*   `<React.Fragment>`
*   `<>` (Shorthand syntax)

**Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <> {/* Shorthand Fragment */}
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>World</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### 19. How do you conditionally render content in React?

**Why it's asked:**  A fundamental skill for creating dynamic UIs.

**Answer:** There are several ways to conditionally render content in React:

*   **If/Else Statements:**  Use traditional JavaScript `if/else` statements within your `render` method or component function.

*   **Ternary Operator:**  Use the ternary operator (`condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`) for simple conditional rendering.

*   **Logical AND Operator:** Use the logical AND operator (`condition && valueIfTrue`) to render something only if the condition is true.

*   **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):** Use an IIFE to execute more complex logic within the JSX.

**Example (If/Else):**

```jsx
function MyComponent({ isLoggedIn }) {
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <p>Welcome, user!</p>;
  } else {
    return <p>Please log in.</p>;
  }
}
```

**Example (Ternary Operator):**

```jsx
function MyComponent({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome, user!</p> : <p>Please log in.</p>;
}
```

**Example (Logical AND):**

```jsx
function MyComponent({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return isLoggedIn && <p>Welcome, user!</p>; // Only renders if isLoggedIn is true
}
```

### 20. How can you prevent re-renders in React?

**Why it's asked:** Tests your knowledge of performance optimization.

**Answer:** Preventing unnecessary re-renders is crucial for optimizing React application performance. Here are several techniques:

*   **`React.memo` (for functional components):**  `React.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component.  It only re-renders the component if its props have changed.  You can provide a custom comparison function as the second argument to `React.memo` if you need more control over the comparison logic.

*   **`PureComponent` (for class components):** `PureComponent` is similar to `React.Component`, but it implements `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow prop and state comparison.  It only re-renders if the props or state have changed.

*   **`shouldComponentUpdate` (for class components):**  This lifecycle method allows you to control whether a component should re-render based on the next props and state.  Implement a custom `shouldComponentUpdate` method to compare the relevant props and state and return `true` if the component should re-render, or `false` if it should not.

*   **`useCallback` and `useMemo` (with Hooks):** Use these hooks to memoize functions and values, respectively.  This prevents unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on those memoized values.

*   **Immutable Data Structures:** Using immutable data structures can simplify the process of detecting changes in props and state, as you can simply compare references.

**Example (React.memo):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ name }) {
  console.log('Rendering MyComponent');
  return <p>Name: {name}</p>;
});

export default MyComponent;
```

**Example (PureComponent):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    console.log('Rendering MyComponent');
    return <p>Name: {this.props.name}</p>;
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Example (shouldComponentUpdate):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Only re-render if the 'name' prop has changed
    return nextProps.name !== this.props.name;
  }

  render() {
    console.log('Rendering MyComponent');
    return <p>Name: {this.props.name}</p>;
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Styling

### 21. What are the different ways to style React components?

**Why it's asked:** Tests your knowledge of styling techniques in React.

**Answer:** There are several ways to style React components:

*   **Inline Styles:** Apply styles directly to the element using the `style` attribute.  The value of the `style` attribute is a JavaScript object where keys are CSS properties (camelCase) and values are CSS values.

*   **CSS Stylesheets:** Import CSS stylesheets into your components. This is the traditional approach and allows you to separate your styles from your component logic.

*   **CSS Modules:** CSS Modules are CSS files where all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. This helps to avoid naming collisions and makes it easier to manage styles in large projects.

*   **Styled Components:** Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS directly in your JavaScript code using tagged template literals. It generates unique class names for your styles and automatically injects them into the DOM.

*   **CSS-in-JS Libraries (e.g., Emotion, JSS):**  CSS-in-JS libraries provide a more programmatic way to define styles in JavaScript. They offer features such as dynamic styling, theming, and component composition.

**Example (Inline Styles):**

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const style = {
    color: 'blue',
    fontSize: '16px'
  };

  return <p style={style}>This is a styled paragraph.</p>;
}
```

**Example (CSS Stylesheets):**

```jsx
// MyComponent.css
.paragraph {
  color: green;
  font-size: 18px;
}

// MyComponent.js
import './MyComponent.css';

function MyComponent() {
  return <p className="paragraph">This is a styled paragraph.</p>;
}
```

**Example (Styled Components):**

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledParagraph = styled.p`
  color: purple;
  font-size: 20px;
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return <StyledParagraph>This is a styled paragraph.</StyledParagraph>;
}
```

## Routing

### 22. What is React Router? How does it work?

**Why it's asked:**  Tests your knowledge of how to handle navigation in React applications.

**Answer:** React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It provides a way to navigate between different views or pages within your application without requiring a full page reload. React Router uses component-based routing, where you define routes as React components.

**How it works:**

1.  **Define Routes:** You use the `<Route>` component to define the routes in your application. Each `<Route>` component maps a specific path to a component that should be rendered when that path is matched.

2.  **`<BrowserRouter>`, `<HashRouter>` or `<MemoryRouter>`:** You wrap your application in one of these router components which manage the browser history. `<BrowserRouter>` uses the HTML5 history API for clean URLs. `<HashRouter>` uses the hash portion of the URL (e.g., `#/about`). `<MemoryRouter>` keeps the history in memory.

3.  **`<Link>` or `<NavLink>`:** You use the `<Link>` or `<NavLink>` component to create links that navigate between routes.  `<NavLink>` is a special type of `<Link>` that adds an `active` class when the link is active.

4.  **Matching and Rendering:** When the user clicks a link, React Router updates the URL and matches it against the defined routes. The component associated with the matched route is then rendered.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Switch>
          <Route path="/about">
            <About />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Advanced Topics

### 23. What is code-splitting in React? Why is it important?

**Why it's asked:** Demonstrates understanding of optimizing application load times.

**Answer:** Code-splitting is a technique for breaking down your React application into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand. This can significantly improve the initial load time of your application, as the browser only needs to download the code that is necessary for the current view.

**Why is it important?**

*   **Improved Initial Load Time:** Reduces the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and parsed when the user first visits your application.
*   **Better User Experience:** Faster load times lead to a better user experience and can improve engagement.
*   **Reduced Network Bandwidth:** Reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.

**Techniques for Code-Splitting:**

*   **`React.lazy` and `Suspense`:**  `React.lazy` allows you to dynamically import components, and `Suspense` allows you to display a fallback UI while the component is loading.
*   **Dynamic Imports:** Use dynamic `import()` statements to load modules on demand.
*   **Route-Based Code-Splitting:** Split your application based on routes, so that each route has its own bundle of code.

**Example (`React.lazy` and `Suspense`):**

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent')); // Dynamically import MyComponent

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 24. What is Context API in React?

**Why it's asked:** Tests knowledge of a built-in state management solution. (Answer already given in Question #12. Refer back to that detailed response.)

### 25. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?

**Why it's asked:** Tests your knowledge of a pattern for reusing component logic.

**Answer:** A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new, enhanced component. HOCs are a pattern for reusing component logic. They allow you to add functionality to existing components without modifying their original code.

**Benefits of using HOCs:**

*   **Code Reusability:** HOCs allow you to share logic between multiple components.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** HOCs separate the shared logic from the component's core logic.
*   **Composability:** HOCs can be chained together to create complex functionality.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// HOC function
function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log(`Component ${WrappedComponent.name} is mounted`);
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}

// Wrapped component
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
}

// Enhance MyComponent with the withLogging HOC
const EnhancedComponent = withLogging(MyComponent);

function App() {
  return <EnhancedComponent name="World" />;
}

export default App;
```

### 26. What are render props?

**Why it's asked:** Tests your knowledge of an alternative pattern to HOCs for reusing component logic.
