# Next.js Security Headers: Best Practices for a Secure Web Application

Securing your Next.js application is crucial in today's threat landscape. One of the most effective and straightforward ways to bolster security is by implementing proper HTTP security headers. These headers act as instructions to the browser, telling it how to behave when handling your website's resources, effectively mitigating common web vulnerabilities. This blog post will delve into the world of Next.js security headers, providing you with best practices and code examples to enhance your application's security posture.

## What are HTTP Security Headers?

HTTP security headers are response headers that a web server sends to the browser. They provide instructions on how the browser should behave while handling the website's resources. They are designed to prevent various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities. By setting these headers correctly, you can drastically improve the security of your Next.js application.

## Key Security Headers to Implement in Next.js

Here's a breakdown of the most important security headers and how to configure them in your Next.js application:

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)

CSP is arguably the most important security header. It defines a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources like scripts, styles, images, and fonts. This significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks.

**How it Works:** You define a policy that dictates which origins are trusted for various resource types. The browser then enforces this policy, blocking any resources that violate it.

**Implementation in Next.js:**

You can implement CSP using middleware or directly in your `next.config.js` file. Here's an example using middleware:

```javascript
// middleware.js (or similar)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const cspHeader = `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
    img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;
    font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
    object-src 'none';
    media-src 'self';
    frame-ancestors 'none';
    upgrade-insecure-requests;
    base-uri 'self';
  `;

  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', cspHeader.replace(/\n/g, ''));

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next
     * - static (static files)
     * - favicon.ico
     */
    '/((?!_next|static|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

**Explanation:**

*   `default-src 'self'`:  Allows resources from the same origin as the document.
*   `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com;`:  Allows scripts from the same origin, inline scripts (use with caution!), scripts using `eval()`, and scripts from Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.  **Important:** 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' should be avoided when possible.  Consider refactoring your code to avoid them. Use nonces or hashes instead for inline styles and scripts if refactoring isn't immediately feasible.
*   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;`: Allows styles from the same origin, inline styles (use with caution!), and styles from Google Fonts.  Use nonces or hashes to secure inline styles.
*   `img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;`: Allows images from the same origin, data URIs (base64 encoded images), and images from Google Analytics.
*   `font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;`: Allows fonts from the same origin and Google Fonts.
*   `object-src 'none'`: Disallows embedding plug-ins like Flash.
*   `media-src 'self'`: Allows media resources from the same origin.
*   `frame-ancestors 'none'`:  Prevents your site from being framed (Clickjacking protection).
*   `upgrade-insecure-requests`: Tells the browser to automatically upgrade HTTP requests to HTTPS.
*   `base-uri 'self'`:  Restricts the base URL to the same origin.

**Important Considerations for CSP:**

*   **Start with `report-uri` or `report-to`:** Use these directives to collect CSP violation reports before enforcing the policy. This allows you to identify and fix any issues without breaking your site.
*   **Be specific:**  Avoid using wildcards (`*`) as they can weaken the effectiveness of CSP.  Be as specific as possible with the allowed origins.
*   **Test thoroughly:** Ensure your CSP doesn't block legitimate resources.  Use browser developer tools to identify and fix any CSP violations.
*   **Nonce or Hash for Inline Styles/Scripts:** If you need to use inline styles or scripts (which should be avoided when possible), use a cryptographically secure nonce or hash.  This tells the browser to only allow inline styles/scripts with the matching nonce or hash.  This is significantly more secure than `'unsafe-inline'`.

**Example using `report-uri`:**

```javascript
const cspHeader = `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
    img-src 'self' data: https://www.google-analytics.com;
    font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
    object-src 'none';
    media-src 'self';
    frame-ancestors 'none';
    upgrade-insecure-requests;
    base-uri 'self';
    report-uri /api/csp-report;
  `;
```

You would then need to create an API route (`/api/csp-report`) to handle the CSP violation reports.

### 2. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

HSTS forces browsers to use HTTPS for all connections to your website. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that all traffic is encrypted.

**Implementation in Next.js:**

```javascript
// middleware.js (or similar)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set(
    'Strict-Transport-Security',
    'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
  );

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|static|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

**Explanation:**

*   `max-age=31536000`: Specifies the time (in seconds) that the browser should remember to only access your site over HTTPS (31536000 seconds is one year).
*   `includeSubDomains`:  Applies the HSTS policy to all subdomains of your website.
*   `preload`: Allows you to submit your website to a HSTS preload list, which is built into browsers. This ensures that even the first connection to your site is made over HTTPS.  You can submit your site to the HSTS preload list at [https://hstspreload.org/](https://hstspreload.org/).

**Important:** Before enabling HSTS with `includeSubDomains` and `preload`, ensure that all your subdomains support HTTPS.

### 3. X-Frame-Options

This header protects against Clickjacking attacks by preventing your website from being embedded in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, or `<object>`.

**Implementation in Next.js:**

```javascript
// middleware.js (or similar)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|static|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

**Options:**

*   `DENY`: Prevents the page from being displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so. This is the most secure option.
*   `SAMEORIGIN`: Allows the page to be displayed in a frame only if the origin of the frame is the same as the origin of the page.

**Recommendation:** Use `DENY` unless you have a specific need to allow framing from the same origin.

### 4. X-Content-Type-Options

This header prevents MIME-sniffing, a technique where browsers try to guess the content type of a resource based on its content, even if the server specifies a different content type. This can lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Implementation in Next.js:**

```javascript
// middleware.js (or similar)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|static|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

**Value:**

*   `nosniff`:  Instructs the browser to strictly adhere to the content type declared in the `Content-Type` header.

### 5. Referrer-Policy

This header controls how much referrer information (the URL of the previous page) is sent along with requests.  It can help prevent information leakage.

**Implementation in Next.js:**

```javascript
// middleware.js (or similar)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|static|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

**Common Options:**

*   `no-referrer`:  Never send the referrer header.
*   `no-referrer-when-downgrade`:  Don't send the referrer header when navigating from HTTPS to HTTP.
*   `origin`:  Send only the origin (scheme, host, and port) in the referrer header.
*   `origin-when-cross-origin`:  Send the origin when navigating to a different origin, and the full URL when navigating within the same origin.
*   `same-origin`:  Send the full URL when navigating within the same origin, and no referrer information when navigating to a different origin.
*   `strict-origin`: Send only the origin (scheme, host, and port) in the referrer header when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send nothing to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
*   `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`:  Send the origin when navigating to a different origin with the same protocol security level (HTTPS→HTTPS), send the full URL when navigating within the same origin, and send nothing to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).

**Recommendation:** `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` provides a good balance between security and functionality.

### 6. Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy)

This header allows you to control which browser features (like geolocation, microphone, camera, etc.) are available to your website. This can help to prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive features without the user's explicit consent.

**Implementation in Next.js:**

```javascript
// middleware.js (or similar)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set(
    'Permissions-Policy',
    'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()'
  );

  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|static|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
};
```

**Explanation:**

*   `geolocation=()`: Disables access to the Geolocation API.
*   `microphone=()`: Disables access to the microphone.
*   `camera=()`: Disables access to the camera.

**Example allowing geolocation from the same origin:**

```javascript
response.headers.set(
    'Permissions-Policy',
    'geolocation=(self)'
);
```

**Important:** Carefully consider which features your website needs and disable the rest.

## Implementing Security Headers in `next.config.js` (Alternative Method)

While middleware is generally the preferred approach for setting security headers as it allows for dynamic configuration, you can also configure them directly in your `next.config.js` file using a custom server. This approach is less flexible but can be suitable for simpler configurations.

**Example `next.config.js` with Custom Server:**

```javascript
const { createServer } = require('http');
const { parse } = require('url');
const next = require('next');

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
const hostname = 'localhost';
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
// when using middleware `hostname` and `port` must be provided like this
const app = next({ dev, hostname, port });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer(async (req, res) => {
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true);
    // Add security headers
    res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:");
    res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload');
    res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
    res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
    res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
    res.setHeader('Permissions-Policy', 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()');


    await handle(req, res, parsedUrl);
  }).listen(port, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(`> Ready on http://${hostname}:${port}`);
  });
});

module.exports = {
  // your other next.config.js options
};
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Custom Server:** Using a custom server in `next.config.js` disables automatic static optimization features. You may need to adjust your application to handle static assets manually.
*   **Flexibility:** This approach is less flexible than using middleware, as you cannot dynamically adjust the headers based on the request.

## Testing Your Security Headers

After implementing your security headers, it's crucial to test them to ensure they are working correctly. Here are some tools you can use:

*   **SecurityHeaders.com:** A website that analyzes your website's HTTP security headers and provides recommendations for improvement.
*   **Browser Developer Tools:**  Use the "Network" tab in your browser's developer tools to inspect the HTTP response headers and verify that your security headers are present and configured correctly. Pay close attention to any CSP violation reports in the console.
*   **CSP Evaluator (Google):**  [https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/)  Helps you evaluate your CSP policy for potential weaknesses.

## Conclusion

Implementing security headers is an essential step in securing your Next.js application. By carefully configuring these headers, you can significantly reduce the risk of common web vulnerabilities like XSS, Clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing. Remember to test your headers thoroughly and keep them updated as your application evolves.  Prioritize using middleware for greater flexibility and consider starting with reporting-only CSP policies before enforcing them to avoid breaking your application. Securing your Next.js application is an ongoing process, and security headers are just one piece of the puzzle.  Stay informed about the latest security best practices and regularly review your application's security posture.
