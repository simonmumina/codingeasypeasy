# Expo Mail Composer: Sending Emails From Your React Native App

Sending emails directly from your React Native application can be a crucial feature for various use cases, such as providing feedback, sharing content, or offering support. The Expo Mail Composer simplifies this process by providing a straightforward API to compose and send emails natively on iOS and Android. This blog post will guide you through integrating Expo Mail Composer into your project, covering installation, usage, handling user interactions, and common troubleshooting tips.

## Why Use Expo Mail Composer?

- **Native Experience:** Leverages the native email client on the user's device, providing a familiar and consistent experience.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android with a single codebase.
- **Simplified API:** Offers a clean and easy-to-use API for composing email drafts.
- **Expo Integration:** Built specifically for Expo projects, ensuring smooth integration and compatibility.
- **No Native Code Required:** Use JavaScript (or TypeScript) to handle email composition, eliminating the need for native code modifications.

## Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Before diving into the code, ensure you have an Expo project set up. If not, you can create a new project using the Expo CLI:

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app my-email-app
cd my-email-app
```

Next, install the `expo-mail-composer` package:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-mail-composer
```

This command installs the necessary package and its dependencies.

## Basic Usage: Composing and Sending Emails

The core functionality of `expo-mail-composer` lies in the `composeAsync` function. This function allows you to specify various email parameters, such as recipients, subject, body, attachments, etc.

Here's a basic example of how to compose an email:

```plaintext
import * as MailComposer from 'expo-mail-composer'
import { Button, Alert } from 'react-native'

const sendEmail = async () => {
  const isAvailable = await MailComposer.isAvailableAsync()

  if (!isAvailable) {
    Alert.alert(
      'Oops!',
      "Looks like you don't have an email account configured on this device.  Please set one up in your device settings."
    )
    return
  }

  const options = {
    recipients: ['recipient1@example.com', 'recipient2@example.com'],
    ccRecipients: ['ccrecipient@example.com'],
    bccRecipients: ['bccrecipient@example.com'],
    subject: 'Hello from my React Native app!',
    body: 'This is the body of the email.  Sent using Expo Mail Composer.',
    isHtml: false, // Set to true if your body contains HTML content
    attachments: [], // We'll cover attachments later
  }

  try {
    const result = await MailComposer.composeAsync(options)

    if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.SENT) {
      console.log('Email sent successfully!')
      Alert.alert('Success!', 'Email has been successfully sent')
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.CANCELLED) {
      console.log('Email composition cancelled by user.')
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.SAVED) {
      console.log('Email saved as a draft.')
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.FAILED) {
      console.log('Email composition failed.')
      Alert.alert('Error!', 'Failed to send the email.')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error composing email:', error)
    Alert.alert('Error!', 'An unexpected error occurred while sending the email.')
  }
}

export default function App() {
  return <Button title="Send Email" onPress={sendEmail} />
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`import * as MailComposer from 'expo-mail-composer';`**: Imports the MailComposer module from the `expo-mail-composer` package.
2. **`MailComposer.isAvailableAsync()`**: Checks if the device is configured to send email. This is crucial to prevent unexpected errors.
3. **`options` object**: Defines the email parameters. Let's break down the options:
   - **`recipients`**: An array of email addresses to send the email to.
   - **`ccRecipients`**: An array of email addresses to CC.
   - **`bccRecipients`**: An array of email addresses to BCC.
   - **`subject`**: The subject line of the email.
   - **`body`**: The body of the email. Can be plain text or HTML (controlled by `isHtml`).
   - **`isHtml`**: A boolean indicating whether the body contains HTML markup.
   - **`attachments`**: An array of file paths to attach to the email (we'll discuss this in detail later).
4. **`MailComposer.composeAsync(options)`**: Opens the native email client with the specified email parameters. It returns a promise that resolves with a `result` object.
5. **`result.status`**: Indicates the outcome of the email composition process. The possible values are:
   - **`MailComposer.ComposeResult.SENT`**: The email was successfully sent.
   - **`MailComposer.ComposeResult.CANCELLED`**: The user cancelled the email composition.
   - **`MailComposer.ComposeResult.SAVED`**: The email was saved as a draft.
   - **`MailComposer.ComposeResult.FAILED`**: The email composition failed.
6. **Error Handling:** A `try...catch` block is used to handle potential errors during the email composition process. Displaying an alert is crucial for user feedback.

## Handling Attachments

Adding attachments to emails is a common requirement. `expo-mail-composer` supports attachments, but you need to provide the correct file paths.

Here's an example of how to add an attachment:

```plaintext
import * as MailComposer from 'expo-mail-composer'
import { Button, Alert, Platform } from 'react-native'
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library'
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions'

// Helper function to get the file path from MediaLibrary
async function getImagePath() {
  try {
    const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.MEDIA_LIBRARY)

    if (status !== 'granted') {
      Alert.alert(
        'Permissions Denied',
        'Sorry, we need media library permissions to fetch the image.'
      )
      return null
    }

    const assets = await MediaLibrary.getAssetsAsync({
      first: 1, // Get the first image.  You can modify this to select a specific image
      mediaType: 'photo',
    })

    if (assets.assets.length > 0) {
      const imageUri = assets.assets[0].uri
      // For iOS, we may need to copy the file to the cache directory
      if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
        const fileExtension = imageUri.split('.').pop()
        const cacheDir = FileSystem.cacheDirectory
        const newUri = `${cacheDir}image.${fileExtension}`
        await FileSystem.copyAsync({
          from: imageUri,
          to: newUri,
        })
        return newUri
      }

      return imageUri
    } else {
      Alert.alert('No Images Found', 'No images were found in your media library.')
      return null
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error getting image path:', error)
    Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to access your media library.')
    return null
  }
}

const sendEmailWithAttachment = async () => {
  const isAvailable = await MailComposer.isAvailableAsync()

  if (!isAvailable) {
    Alert.alert(
      'Oops!',
      "Looks like you don't have an email account configured on this device.  Please set one up in your device settings."
    )
    return
  }

  const imagePath = await getImagePath()

  if (!imagePath) {
    // No image selected or an error occurred.  Do not proceed.
    return
  }

  const options = {
    recipients: ['recipient1@example.com'],
    subject: 'Email with Attachment',
    body: 'This email has an attachment.',
    attachments: [imagePath], // Array of file paths
  }

  try {
    const result = await MailComposer.composeAsync(options)
    if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.SENT) {
      console.log('Email sent successfully!')
      Alert.alert('Success!', 'Email with attachment has been sent.')
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.CANCELLED) {
      console.log('Email composition cancelled by user.')
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.SAVED) {
      console.log('Email saved as a draft.')
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.FAILED) {
      console.log('Email composition failed.')
      Alert.alert('Error!', 'Failed to send the email with attachment.')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error composing email:', error)
    Alert.alert('Error!', 'An unexpected error occurred while sending the email with attachment.')
  }
}

export default function App() {
  return <Button title="Send Email with Attachment" onPress={sendEmailWithAttachment} />
}
```

**Key points:**

1.  **Permissions:** You need to request permissions to access the device's media library using `expo-permissions` and `expo-media-library`.
2.  **`expo-media-library`**: Used to fetch the image from the user's device.
3.  **File Paths**: The `attachments` array requires valid file paths. This example uses an image from the media library.
4.  **iOS Considerations**: On iOS, images from the MediaLibrary may need to be copied to the application's cache directory before they can be attached to an email. The example shows how to do this using `expo-file-system`. This is due to sandboxing restrictions.
5.  **Error Handling:** Handle cases where the user denies permissions or no images are found in the library.

**Important Considerations for Attachments:**

- **File Size:** Be mindful of file sizes, as large attachments can lead to errors or slow sending times. Consider compressing images or providing options for users to select smaller files.
- **File Types:** Ensure the file types you're attaching are supported by the native email client. Common types like images, PDFs, and text files are generally supported.
- **Temporary Files:** For files that are generated dynamically (e.g., created from user input), you'll need to save them to a temporary location on the device before attaching them. Use `expo-file-system` to handle file storage.
- **Security:** Be cautious about attaching sensitive information. Encrypt data if necessary.

## TypeScript Support

`expo-mail-composer` has excellent TypeScript support. You can take advantage of type definitions for better code completion and error checking. Here's an example using TypeScript:

```plaintext
import * as MailComposer from 'expo-mail-composer';
import { Button, Alert } from 'react-native';

interface EmailOptions {
  recipients: string[];
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  isHtml: boolean;
}

const sendEmail = async (options: EmailOptions) => {
  const isAvailable = await MailComposer.isAvailableAsync();

  if (!isAvailable) {
    Alert.alert(
      "Oops!",
      "Looks like you don't have an email account configured on this device.  Please set one up in your device settings."
    );
    return;
  }

  try {
    const result = await MailComposer.composeAsync({
      recipients: options.recipients,
      subject: options.subject,
      body: options.body,
      isHtml: options.isHtml,
    });

    if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.SENT) {
      console.log('Email sent successfully!');
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.CANCELLED) {
      console.log('Email composition cancelled by user.');
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.SAVED) {
      console.log('Email saved as a draft.');
    } else if (result.status === MailComposer.ComposeResult.FAILED) {
      console.log('Email composition failed.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error composing email:', error);
  }
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Button
      title="Send Email"
      onPress={() =>
        sendEmail({
          recipients: ['test@example.com'],
          subject: 'Hello from TypeScript!',
          body: 'This email was sent using TypeScript.',
          isHtml: false,
        })
      }
    />
  );
}
```

This example defines an `EmailOptions` interface to specify the types for the email parameters.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **`MailComposer.isAvailableAsync()` returns `false`**: This indicates that the device does not have a configured email account. Prompt the user to set up an email account in their device settings.
- **Permissions Issues:** Ensure you have requested the necessary permissions (e.g., for accessing the media library for attachments) and that the user has granted them.
- **File Path Errors:** Double-check that the file paths for attachments are correct and accessible by your application. On iOS, remember to copy files from the MediaLibrary to the cache directory if needed.
- **Email Client Not Opening:** If the email client doesn't open after calling `composeAsync`, check for any errors in your code, particularly in the email options. Also, make sure you are running the code on a real device or simulator that supports email functionality. Web browsers don't have native email capabilities.
- **Error: "Mail service is not available" (iOS)**: This can occur if the application is running in the background or if there is an issue with the Mail app on the device. Try restarting the app or the device.
- **Build Issues After Adding `expo-mail-composer`:** Sometimes, adding `expo-mail-composer` can lead to build failures, especially with older Expo SDK versions. Try cleaning your build cache:
  ```plaintext
  expo start -c
  ```
  This clears the cache and restarts the bundler.

## Conclusion

Expo Mail Composer provides a simple and efficient way to integrate email functionality into your React Native applications. By leveraging the native email client on the user's device, you can provide a seamless and familiar experience. Remember to handle permissions, file paths (especially on iOS), and error cases to ensure a robust and reliable email integration. This guide covers the fundamentals, from simple email composition to handling attachments, and troubleshooting common issues. Happy coding!
