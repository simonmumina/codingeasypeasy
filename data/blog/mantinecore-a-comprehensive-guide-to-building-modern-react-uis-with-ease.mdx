## Getting Started with @mantine/core

Let's walk through the steps to integrate `@mantine/core` into your React project.

**1. Install Dependencies:**

```plaintext
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/notifications
```

- `@mantine/core`: The core package containing all the UI components.
- `@mantine/hooks`: Provides a set of useful React hooks for managing state, effects, and more.
- `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/server`: CSS-in-JS libraries used for styling.
- `@mantine/notifications`: Provides a notification system for your application. Optional, but often useful.

**2. Configure the Provider:**

Wrap your application with the `MantineProvider` to provide the Mantine theme context to your components.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core'

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={{ colorScheme: 'light' }}>
      {/* Your application content */}
      <h1>Welcome to Mantine!</h1>
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

- `withGlobalStyles`: Adds global styles for consistent typography and spacing.
- `withNormalizeCSS`: Applies a CSS reset to normalize styles across different browsers.
- `theme`: An object that allows you to customize the theme of your application. Here we're setting the `colorScheme` to 'light'.

**3. Using Components:**

Now you can start using Mantine components in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { MantineProvider, Button, TextInput } from '@mantine/core'

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={{ colorScheme: 'light' }}>
      <div>
        <TextInput
          label="Your Name"
          placeholder="Enter your name"
          description="This is used for greeting."
          required
        />
        <Button color="blue" mt="md">
          Submit
        </Button>
      </div>
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `TextInput` and `Button` components. Notice the `mt="md"` prop on the button. Mantine utilizes a consistent spacing system, where `mt` stands for margin-top and `md` corresponds to a medium spacing value defined in your theme.

## Theming in @mantine/core

Mantine's theming system allows you to customize the appearance of your application to match your brand. You can modify various aspects of the theme, including:

- **Colors:** Define your primary, secondary, and accent colors.
- **Fonts:** Choose different fonts for headings, body text, and other elements.
- **Breakpoints:** Customize the breakpoints used for responsive design.
- **Spacing:** Define the spacing scale used for margins, padding, and gaps.
- **Border Radius:** Control the roundness of borders.

**Customizing the Theme:**

You can customize the theme by passing a `theme` object to the `MantineProvider`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { MantineProvider, Button } from '@mantine/core'

const theme = {
  fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif',
  colors: {
    brand: [
      '#228BE6',
      '#339AF0',
      '#4DABF7',
      '#74C0FC',
      '#A5D8FF',
      '#D0EBFF',
      '#E7F5FF',
      '#EDF2F7',
      '#F9FAFB',
      '#FFFFFF',
    ], // Example blue shades
  },
  primaryColor: 'brand', // Use the brand color as the primary color
  headings: { fontFamily: 'Montserrat, sans-serif' },
}

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={theme}>
      <Button color="brand.0">Click Me</Button>
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

In this example, we're customizing the `fontFamily`, `colors`, `primaryColor`, and `headings` properties of the theme. We're also creating a new color palette called `brand` and using the first shade (index 0) of that palette for the button's color.

**Color Schemes (Light and Dark):**

Mantine supports light and dark color schemes. You can switch between them programmatically or let users choose their preferred scheme.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { MantineProvider, Button } from '@mantine/core'
import { useMantineColorScheme, useMantineTheme } from '@mantine/hooks'

function App() {
  const { colorScheme, toggleColorScheme } = useMantineColorScheme()
  const theme = useMantineTheme()

  return (
    <MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={{ colorScheme }}>
      <div>
        <Button onClick={() => toggleColorScheme()}>
          Toggle {colorScheme === 'dark' ? 'Light' : 'Dark'} Mode
        </Button>
        <p style={{ color: theme.colors.gray[colorScheme === 'dark' ? 0 : 9] }}>
          This text changes color based on the color scheme.
        </p>
      </div>
    </MantineProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `useMantineColorScheme` hook to toggle between light and dark modes. The `useMantineTheme` hook is used to access the current theme and apply styles dynamically based on the chosen color scheme.

## Common Components and Their Usage

Let's explore some of the most commonly used components in `@mantine/core`.

**1. Button:**

The `Button` component is a fundamental UI element for triggering actions.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@mantine/core'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button color="green" onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
      <Button variant="outline" color="red">
        Outline Button
      </Button>
      <Button loading>Loading Button</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- `color`: Specifies the color of the button (e.g., "green", "red", "blue"). Uses your theme's colors.
- `variant`: Determines the appearance of the button (e.g., "filled", "outline", "light").
- `onClick`: A function to be executed when the button is clicked.
- `loading`: Displays a loading indicator within the button.

**2. TextInput:**

The `TextInput` component provides a basic text input field.

```jsx
import { TextInput } from '@mantine/core'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <TextInput
      label="Email"
      placeholder="your@email.com"
      description="Enter your email address"
      required
      error="Invalid email address"
    />
  )
}
```

- `label`: The label for the input field.
- `placeholder`: The placeholder text displayed in the input field.
- `description`: A description that appears below the input field.
- `required`: Indicates whether the input field is required.
- `error`: Displays an error message below the input field.

**3. Select:**

The `Select` component allows users to choose from a list of options.

```jsx
import { Select } from '@mantine/core'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Select
      label="Framework"
      placeholder="Pick one"
      data={[
        { value: 'react', label: 'React' },
        { value: 'angular', label: 'Angular' },
        { value: 'vue', label: 'Vue' },
      ]}
    />
  )
}
```

- `label`: The label for the select field.
- `placeholder`: The placeholder text displayed in the select field.
- `data`: An array of objects, each representing an option in the select field. Each object must have a `value` and a `label` property.

**4. Modal:**

The `Modal` component allows you to display content in a popup window.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Modal, Button, Text } from '@mantine/core'

function MyComponent() {
  const [opened, setOpened] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      <Modal opened={opened} onClose={() => setOpened(false)} title="My Modal">
        <Text size="sm">This is the content of the modal.</Text>
      </Modal>

      <Button onClick={() => setOpened(true)}>Open Modal</Button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- `opened`: A boolean value indicating whether the modal is open.
- `onClose`: A function to be executed when the modal is closed.
- `title`: The title of the modal.

**5. Card:**

The `Card` Component is used to group related information.
