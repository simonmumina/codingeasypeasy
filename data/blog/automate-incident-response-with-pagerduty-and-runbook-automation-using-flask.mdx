# Automate Incident Response with PagerDuty and Runbook Automation using Flask

Incident response is a critical aspect of maintaining system reliability and ensuring business continuity.  The faster you can identify, diagnose, and resolve incidents, the less impact they have on your users and your bottom line. PagerDuty is a leading incident management platform that helps teams identify and respond to incidents quickly. Combining PagerDuty with Runbook Automation, especially when powered by a flexible framework like Flask, can significantly streamline your incident response process and reduce your Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).

This blog post will guide you through integrating PagerDuty with Flask to trigger automated runbooks.  We'll cover the necessary steps, including setting up a Flask application, configuring PagerDuty webhooks, and implementing the logic to execute automated tasks based on incident information.

## Why PagerDuty and Runbook Automation?

Here's why integrating PagerDuty with runbook automation is a powerful approach:

* **Faster Incident Response:**  Automated runbooks can quickly perform routine tasks like restarting services, scaling resources, or collecting diagnostic data, reducing the time it takes to resolve incidents.
* **Reduced Manual Effort:** Automating repetitive tasks frees up engineers to focus on more complex and critical aspects of incident resolution.
* **Improved Consistency:**  Runbooks ensure that tasks are performed consistently, regardless of the engineer on call.  This reduces the risk of human error and ensures that the incident is handled in a standardized way.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Runbooks can be designed to collect data and provide context that can be shared with other team members, improving collaboration and facilitating faster diagnosis.
* **Reduced MTTR:** By automating key steps in the incident response process, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to resolve incidents, minimizing downtime and improving user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

* **PagerDuty Account:**  You'll need an active PagerDuty account with the necessary permissions to create integrations.
* **Python 3.6+:**  Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.
* **Flask:** You'll need to install Flask, a Python web framework.
* **A Runbook Automation System (Optional):** This tutorial focuses on integrating with PagerDuty and providing the framework in Flask. You will need an existing runbook automation solution or a system where you define and execute your automated tasks. This could be a custom script, a configuration management tool like Ansible, or a dedicated runbook automation platform.
* **ngrok (Optional):**  If you're developing locally, you'll need a tool like ngrok to expose your Flask application to the internet so that PagerDuty can send webhooks.

## Step 1: Setting Up a Flask Application

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir pagerduty-runbook-automation
cd pagerduty-runbook-automation
```

Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

Install Flask:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

Now, create a file named `app.py` and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Replace with your actual runbook execution logic
def execute_runbook(incident_data):
    """
    This function simulates executing a runbook based on the incident data.
    In a real-world scenario, this function would trigger an actual runbook
    in your automation system (e.g., Ansible, Rundeck, custom scripts).
    """
    incident_number = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('incident_number', 'N/A')
    incident_id = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('id', 'N/A')
    log_message = f"Received PagerDuty incident #{incident_number} (ID: {incident_id}).  Simulating runbook execution."
    print(log_message)

    #  Example:  Write the incident data to a log file.
    log_file_path = "incident_log.txt"
    with open(log_file_path, "a") as log_file:
      log_file.write(json.dumps(incident_data, indent=4) + "\n")
      print(f"Incident data written to {log_file_path}")

    return {"status": "success", "message": log_message}


@app.route('/pagerduty', methods=['POST'])
def pagerduty_webhook():
    """
    This endpoint receives PagerDuty webhooks.
    """
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        print("Received PagerDuty Webhook:", json.dumps(data, indent=4))  # For debugging
        # You might want to verify the signature here for security (See PagerDuty documentation)


        # Check if the webhook event is a trigger event
        if data and 'messages' in data:
            for message in data['messages']:
                if message['event'] == 'incident.trigger':
                    incident_data = message['payload']
                    result = execute_runbook(incident_data)
                    return jsonify(result), 200
                elif message['event'] == 'incident.resolve':
                  incident_data = message['payload']
                  incident_number = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('incident_number', 'N/A')
                  print(f"Incident #{incident_number} resolved.  No runbook execution needed.")
                  return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": f"Incident {incident_number} resolved. No runbook executed."}), 200


        return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Webhook received but no runbook triggered."}), 200

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing webhook: {e}")
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": str(e)}), 500



if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Get the port number from the environment variable, default to 5000
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

**Explanation:**

* **`execute_runbook(incident_data)`:** This function is a placeholder for your actual runbook execution logic.  It currently simulates the execution by printing a message and logging the incident data.  You'll need to replace this with your own code to trigger your runbook automation system.  The `incident_data` dictionary contains information about the incident, such as the incident number, ID, and details about the impacted service.  This information is crucial for determining which runbook to execute and what parameters to pass to it.
* **`/pagerduty` endpoint:** This is the endpoint that PagerDuty will call when an incident is triggered. It receives the webhook payload, parses the data, and calls the `execute_runbook` function if the event is an `incident.trigger`. It also handles `incident.resolve` events, logging the resolution but not triggering a runbook.  The code includes basic error handling and logging for debugging purposes.  It also returns a JSON response to PagerDuty indicating the status of the webhook processing.
* **`request.get_json()`:** This retrieves the JSON payload from the incoming webhook request.
* **`jsonify()`:** This converts a Python dictionary into a JSON response.
* **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block catches any exceptions that occur during webhook processing and returns an error response to PagerDuty. This is important for ensuring that PagerDuty knows if the webhook was successfully processed.
* **Debug Mode:** The `app.run(debug=True)` line enables debug mode, which provides more detailed error messages and automatically reloads the server when you make changes to the code.  **Don't use debug mode in production!**
* **Port Handling:**  The code uses `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)` to get the port number from an environment variable. This is useful for deploying to platforms like Heroku or Google Cloud Platform, where the port number is dynamically assigned.  If the `PORT` environment variable is not set, it defaults to port 5000.
* **Signature Verification (Important):**  **This example *does not* include signature verification.**  For security reasons, you should always verify the signature of incoming PagerDuty webhooks to ensure that they are coming from PagerDuty and haven't been tampered with.  PagerDuty provides instructions and libraries for verifying webhook signatures.  See the PagerDuty documentation for details.

## Step 2: Exposing Your Flask Application

To allow PagerDuty to send webhooks to your Flask application, you need to make it accessible from the internet.  If you're deploying to a cloud platform like Heroku or Google Cloud Platform, your application will automatically be accessible via a public URL.

If you're developing locally, you can use a tool like ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your local machine.

1. **Download and install ngrok:**  You can download ngrok from [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. **Run ngrok:**  Open a new terminal window and run the following command:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000  # Assuming your Flask application is running on port 5000
   ```

   Ngrok will display a public URL that you can use to access your Flask application.  It will look something like this:

   ```
   Forwarding                    http://<random-string>.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
   Forwarding                    https://<random-string>.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
   ```

   **Copy the HTTPS URL.**  This is the URL you'll use to configure the PagerDuty webhook.

## Step 3: Configuring PagerDuty Webhooks

1. **Log in to your PagerDuty account.**
2. **Navigate to Integrations:** Go to **Services** -> **Service Directory** and select the service you want to integrate with. Then go to the **Integrations** tab.
3. **Add a new integration:** Click the "New Integration" button.
4. **Select "Webhooks v3 Endpoint":**  Choose "Webhooks v3 Endpoint" as the integration type. Give it a name (e.g., "Flask Runbook Automation").
5. **Configure the webhook:**
    * **Integration Name:**  Give your integration a descriptive name.
    * **Integration Type:** Select "Webhooks v3 Endpoint".
    * **Endpoint URL:**  Enter the HTTPS URL that ngrok provided, followed by `/pagerduty`.  For example: `https://<random-string>.ngrok.io/pagerduty`.
    * **Events to send:** Select "Incident Triggered" and "Incident Resolved".  You can also select other events as needed.  The more events you select, the more data you'll have available to your runbooks.
    * **Headers (Optional):** You can add custom headers if your Flask application requires them.
    * **Enable Integration:**  Ensure the integration is enabled.
6. **Save the integration:** Click the "Add Integration" button to save the configuration.

## Step 4: Testing the Integration

Now, you can test the integration by triggering an incident in PagerDuty.

1. **Trigger an incident:**  Create a new incident in PagerDuty for the service you configured. You can do this manually or through an alert from a monitoring tool.
2. **Check your Flask application's output:**  Look at the terminal where you're running your Flask application. You should see the "Received PagerDuty Webhook" message, followed by the incident data. You should also see the "Simulating runbook execution" message.
3. **Check the `incident_log.txt` file:** Verify that the incident data has been written to the `incident_log.txt` file.

If everything is working correctly, you've successfully integrated PagerDuty with your Flask application and are ready to implement your actual runbook execution logic.

## Step 5: Implementing Runbook Execution Logic

Now comes the crucial part: replacing the placeholder `execute_runbook` function with your actual runbook execution logic.  This is where you'll integrate with your runbook automation system (e.g., Ansible, Rundeck, custom scripts).

Here are some examples of how you might implement runbook execution logic using different technologies:

**Example 1: Executing an Ansible Playbook**

```python
import subprocess

def execute_runbook(incident_data):
    incident_number = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('incident_number', 'N/A')
    service_name = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('service', {}).get('name', 'N/A')

    # Construct the Ansible playbook command
    ansible_playbook_command = [
        "ansible-playbook",
        "path/to/your/playbook.yml",
        "-e", f"incident_number={incident_number}",
        "-e", f"service_name={service_name}"
    ]

    try:
        # Execute the Ansible playbook
        result = subprocess.run(ansible_playbook_command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

        # Log the output
        print("Ansible Playbook Output:", result.stdout)
        print("Ansible Playbook Errors:", result.stderr)

        return {"status": "success", "message": f"Ansible playbook executed successfully for incident #{incident_number}."}

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Ansible Playbook Execution Failed:", e.stderr)
        return {"status": "error", "message": f"Ansible playbook execution failed: {e.stderr}"}

```

**Explanation:**

* This example uses the `subprocess` module to execute an Ansible playbook.
* It constructs the `ansible-playbook` command, passing the incident number and service name as extra variables (`-e`).
* The `capture_output=True` argument captures the output of the playbook.
* The `check=True` argument raises an exception if the playbook fails.
* The `try...except` block handles any errors that occur during playbook execution.
* **Security Note:**  Be very careful when executing external commands.  Ensure that the input data is properly sanitized to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

**Example 2: Triggering a Rundeck Job**

```python
import requests

def execute_runbook(incident_data):
    incident_number = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('incident_number', 'N/A')
    service_name = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('service', {}).get('name', 'N/A')

    rundeck_api_url = "YOUR_RUNDECK_API_URL"
    rundeck_job_id = "YOUR_RUNDECK_JOB_ID"
    rundeck_api_token = "YOUR_RUNDECK_API_TOKEN"

    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-Rundeck-Auth-Token": rundeck_api_token
    }

    data = {
        "options": {
            "incident_number": incident_number,
            "service_name": service_name
        }
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(f"{rundeck_api_url}/api/42/job/{rundeck_job_id}/executions",
                                 headers=headers, json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)

        execution_id = response.json().get('id')
        return {"status": "success", "message": f"Rundeck job triggered successfully. Execution ID: {execution_id}"}

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return {"status": "error", "message": f"Error triggering Rundeck job: {e}"}
```

**Explanation:**

* This example uses the `requests` library to make an API call to Rundeck to trigger a job.
* It sets the necessary headers, including the Rundeck API token.
* It passes the incident number and service name as options to the Rundeck job.
* The `response.raise_for_status()` method raises an exception if the API call returns an error.

**Example 3: Executing a Custom Python Script**

```python
import subprocess

def execute_runbook(incident_data):
    incident_number = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('incident_number', 'N/A')
    service_name = incident_data.get('incident', {}).get('service', {}).get('name', 'N/A')

    script_path = "path/to/your/script.py"

    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["python3", script_path, incident_number, service_name], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)

        print("Script Output:", result.stdout)
        print("Script Errors:", result.stderr)

        return {"status": "success", "message": f"Script executed successfully for incident #{incident_number}."}

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Script Execution Failed:", e.stderr)
        return {"status": "error", "message": f"Script execution failed: {e.stderr}"}
```

**Explanation:**

* This example executes a custom Python script using the `subprocess` module.
* It passes the incident number and service name as command-line arguments to the script.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Make sure your Flask application is properly authenticated and authorized to execute runbooks.  Use API keys, tokens, or other authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users or services can trigger runbooks.
* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to catch any exceptions that occur during runbook execution.  Log errors and return informative error messages to PagerDuty.
* **Security:**  Sanitize all input data to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.  Be careful when executing external commands.  Use least privilege principles to grant your Flask application only the necessary permissions.
* **Logging:**  Log all runbook executions, including the incident data, the runbook that was executed, and the results of the execution.  This will help you troubleshoot issues and track the effectiveness of your runbooks.
* **Idempotency:**  Design your runbooks to be idempotent, meaning that they can be executed multiple times without causing unintended side effects.  This is important in case a webhook is delivered multiple times.
* **Asynchronous Execution:** For long-running runbooks, consider using a task queue (e.g., Celery) to execute them asynchronously. This will prevent your Flask application from blocking and will allow it to handle more webhook requests.

## Security Considerations

* **Webhook Signature Verification:** Implement PagerDuty webhook signature verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of incoming webhook requests. This prevents malicious actors from spoofing PagerDuty events and triggering unauthorized actions.  Refer to PagerDuty's official documentation for detailed instructions and code examples.
* **API Key Security:**  Never hardcode API keys or sensitive credentials directly into your code.  Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store API keys and other secrets.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data from PagerDuty webhooks before using it in runbook execution commands. This prevents command injection and other security vulnerabilities.  Use parameterized queries or other safe coding practices when interacting with databases or other systems.
* **Least Privilege:** Grant your Flask application and runbook automation system only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks. This limits the potential impact of a security breach.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on your Flask endpoint to prevent denial-of-service attacks. This can be done using Flask extensions or a reverse proxy server.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your Flask application and runbook automation system to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Integrating PagerDuty with runbook automation using Flask is a powerful way to streamline your incident response process and reduce your MTTR. By automating routine tasks, you can free up engineers to focus on more complex and critical aspects of incident resolution.  Remember to implement proper security measures to protect your system from vulnerabilities.  By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can create a robust and efficient incident response system that helps you keep your systems running smoothly.  Remember to adapt the code examples to your specific environment and runbook automation system. Good luck!
