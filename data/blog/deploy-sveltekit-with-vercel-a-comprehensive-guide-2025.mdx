*   **Optimized for Modern Frameworks:** Vercel is built to understand and optimize deployments for modern frameworks like SvelteKit.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

*   **A Vercel Account:** Sign up for a free account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
*   **Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm:**  SvelteKit requires Node.js. Make sure you have a recent version installed.
*   **A SvelteKit Project:** If you don't have one already, create a new SvelteKit project using the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm create svelte@latest my-sveltekit-app
    cd my-sveltekit-app
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn create svelte my-sveltekit-app
    cd my-sveltekit-app
    yarn install
    ```
    Or using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm create svelte my-sveltekit-app
    cd my-sveltekit-app
    pnpm install
    ```

*   **Git Repository:**  Initialize a Git repository for your project and push it to a service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.  This is crucial for Vercel's automatic deployment feature.

## Step 1: Configure your SvelteKit Project for Vercel

SvelteKit is designed to work seamlessly with Vercel. However, let's ensure everything is correctly configured.

1.  **Ensure the Correct Adapter:**  SvelteKit uses adapters to target different environments. By default, it uses the `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` adapter, which usually detects Vercel correctly. However, you can explicitly use the `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` adapter.

    Install the adapter if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    npm install -D @sveltejs/adapter-vercel
    ```
    Or using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add -D @sveltejs/adapter-vercel
    ```
    Or using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm add -D @sveltejs/adapter-vercel
    ```

2.  **Update `svelte.config.js`:**  Modify your `svelte.config.js` file to use the adapter:

    ```javascript
    import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';
    import { vitePreprocess } from 'svelte-preprocess';

    /** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
    const config = {
        kit: {
            adapter: adapter({
                // See below for an explanation of these options:
                edge: false, // defaults to false
                split: false // defaults to false
            }),
            prerender: {
                handleHttpError: 'warn' // or 'fail'
            }
        },
        preprocess: [
            vitePreprocess()
        ]
    };

    export default config;
    ```

    **Explanation of Adapter Options:**

    *   `edge: false` (or `true` for Edge Functions):  Determines whether your server-side code runs on Vercel's Edge Network or on Node.js serverless functions. Edge functions are generally faster for globally distributed content, but have some limitations.  For most applications, starting with `edge: false` is recommended. Setting this to `true` will deploy SvelteKit's server runtime to Vercel Edge Functions.
    *  `split: false` (or `true`): Setting to `true` will split your application into multiple Serverless Functions. This can reduce cold boot times and improve performance.

    *   `prerender.handleHttpError`: This option controls how SvelteKit handles HTTP errors during prerendering.  Setting it to `'warn'` will log errors but continue the build process, while `'fail'` will stop the build on error.

## Step 2: Connect Your Repository to Vercel

1.  **Log in to Vercel:**  Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and log in to your account.
2.  **Create a New Project:**  Click the "Add New..." button and select "Project."
3.  **Import Your Git Repository:**  Choose the Git provider where your repository is hosted (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). You might need to authorize Vercel to access your repositories.
4.  **Select Your Repository:**  Find your SvelteKit project repository in the list and click "Import."

## Step 3: Configure Your Vercel Project

Vercel will automatically detect that it's a SvelteKit project and pre-configure the deployment settings. However, it's always good to double-check.

1.  **Framework Preset:**  Vercel should automatically detect the "SvelteKit" framework preset.  If it doesn't, manually select it from the dropdown.
2.  **Root Directory:**  The root directory should be the root of your Git repository. Usually, this is just `.`.
3.  **Build Command:**  Vercel should automatically set the build command to `npm run build` (or `yarn build` or `pnpm build` depending on your package manager).
4.  **Output Directory:**  Vercel should automatically set the output directory to `.svelte-kit/vercel-output`.  This directory is generated by the SvelteKit adapter.
5.  **Install Command:** Vercel should automatically set the install command to `npm install` (or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` depending on your package manager).
6.  **Environment Variables (Optional):** If your application uses environment variables, add them to the "Environment Variables" section. This is crucial for sensitive information like API keys.  Remember to never commit sensitive information directly to your Git repository.

    Here's an example of adding a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

    *   **Name:** `DATABASE_URL`
    *   **Value:** Your actual database connection string.

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=your_actual_database_connection_string
    ```

## Step 4: Deploy!

1.  **Click "Deploy":**  Once you've verified the configuration, click the "Deploy" button.

Vercel will now build and deploy your SvelteKit application. You'll see the build progress in the Vercel dashboard.  Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL where your application is live.

## Step 5: Configure Domains (Optional)

Vercel automatically provides a `.vercel.app` domain for your deployment. However, you'll likely want to use your own custom domain.

1.  **Go to the "Domains" Tab:** In your Vercel project dashboard, click the "Domains" tab.
2.  **Add Your Domain:** Enter your domain name and follow the instructions to configure your DNS records.  Vercel will guide you through the process of adding the necessary A, CNAME, or TXT records to your domain registrar's settings.

## Continuous Deployment

One of the biggest advantages of using Vercel is its continuous deployment feature.  Whenever you push changes to your Git repository (to the branch you selected during project setup), Vercel will automatically rebuild and deploy your application. This makes it easy to keep your application up-to-date with the latest changes.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

*   **Build Errors:** Carefully examine the build logs in the Vercel dashboard for any errors during the build process.  Common causes include missing dependencies, incorrect configuration, or syntax errors in your code.
*   **Environment Variable Issues:**  Double-check that your environment variables are correctly configured in Vercel and that your application is correctly accessing them.
*   **Adapter Configuration:** Make sure the `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` (or `@sveltejs/adapter-auto`) adapter is correctly configured in your `svelte.config.js` file.
*   **Deployment Stuck:** If your deployment seems stuck, try redeploying the project or contacting Vercel support.
*   **404 Errors:** Check your routing and ensure that the correct pages are being served. Examine the browser console for any client-side errors. Make sure that the pages you expect to be prerendered are actually being prerendered in your `svelte.config.js` file if you are using static adapters

## Example: Adding a Simple API Route

Let's add a simple API route to your SvelteKit project to demonstrate the serverless functions capability:

1.  **Create an API Endpoint:** Create a file `src/routes/api/hello/+server.js` (or `.ts`):

    ```javascript
    // src/routes/api/hello/+server.js
    import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';

    /** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */
    export async function GET() {
      return json({
        message: 'Hello from SvelteKit and Vercel!'
      });
    }
    ```

2.  **Access the API Endpoint:**  You can now access this endpoint at `/api/hello`.

    For example, in a Svelte component:

    ```svelte
    <script>
      let message = 'Loading...';

      async function fetchMessage() {
        const res = await fetch('/api/hello');
        const data = await res.json();
        message = data.message;
      }

      fetchMessage();
    </script>

    <h1>{message}</h1>
    ```

This demonstrates how you can easily create serverless functions in your SvelteKit application and deploy them to Vercel.
