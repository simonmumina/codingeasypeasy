# Expo Device: Deep Dive into Device Information in React Native with Expo

Building React Native applications with Expo often requires access to device-specific information. Knowing the device type, operating system, or unique identifiers can be crucial for feature enabling, analytics, and debugging. That's where the `expo-device` package comes in. This guide provides a comprehensive exploration of the `expo-device` API, covering installation, usage with practical examples, and potential use cases to enhance your mobile development workflow.

## What is Expo Device?

`expo-device` is an Expo module that provides a consistent and reliable way to access a wealth of device information in your React Native applications. It abstracts away the complexities of platform-specific APIs (iOS vs. Android) and provides a unified interface for retrieving data such as:

- **Device Name:** The human-readable name of the device.
- **Device Type:** Whether it's a phone, tablet, desktop, TV, or a web browser.
- **Operating System:** The device's operating system (iOS or Android).
- **OS Version:** The version of the operating system.
- **Manufacturer:** The device manufacturer (e.g., Apple, Samsung).
- **Model Name:** The specific model of the device (e.g., iPhone 14 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23).
- **Brand:** The device brand (e.g., Apple, Samsung).
- **Unique IDs:** Secure hardware identifier (e.g., `osBuildId`, `product`). **Use with Caution and Privacy Considerations!**
- **Supports Audio/Video Recording:** Capabilities check
- **And more!**

## Why Use Expo Device?

- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Avoid platform-specific code for accessing device information. `expo-device` offers a single API for both iOS and Android.
- **Simplified Development:** Access device data without dealing with native modules or complex configurations.
- **Expo Ecosystem Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Expo modules and workflows.
- **Improved Analytics:** Gather detailed device insights for better understanding your user base.
- **Conditional Feature Enabling:** Enable or disable features based on the device type, operating system, or other device characteristics.
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Use device information to identify and resolve issues specific to certain devices or operating systems.

## Installation

To install `expo-device` in your Expo project, use the following command:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-device
```

This command automatically installs the package and adds it to your project's dependencies.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to retrieve the device name and OS version using `expo-device`:

```plaintext
import * as Device from 'expo-device'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [deviceName, setDeviceName] = useState('Unknown Device')
  const [osVersion, setOsVersion] = useState('Unknown OS Version')

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getDeviceInfo() {
      const name = await Device.deviceName
      const version = Device.osVersion

      setDeviceName(name)
      setOsVersion(version)
    }

    getDeviceInfo()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Device Information</Text>
      <Text>Device Name: {deviceName}</Text>
      <Text>OS Version: {osVersion}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
})
```

In this example:

1.  We import the `Device` module from `expo-device`.
2.  We use `useState` to store the device name and OS version.
3.  In the `useEffect` hook, we call the `getDeviceInfo` function when the component mounts.
4.  `getDeviceInfo` uses `Device.deviceName` (async) and `Device.osVersion` (sync) to retrieve the device name and OS version, respectively.
5.  Finally, we update the state variables with the retrieved values, which are then displayed in the UI.

## Exploring the Expo Device API

The `expo-device` module provides a rich set of properties and methods to access various aspects of device information. Let's explore some of the key ones:

### Properties

- **`brand`**: (string) The brand of the device. Example: "Apple", "Samsung".
- **`designName`**: (string) The Marketing Name of the device. Example "iPhone 13 Pro Max"
- **`deviceName`**: (string, async) The device's human-readable name. This requires the `expo-device` permission on Android API < 33. Example: "John's iPhone", "Samsung Galaxy S23".
- **`deviceType`**: (string) The type of device. Possible values: `"phone"`, `"tablet"`, `"desktop"`, `"tv"`, `"unknown"`.
- **`osName`**: (string) The operating system name. Example: "iOS", "Android".
- **`osVersion`**: (string) The operating system version. Example: "16.4", "13".
- **`manufacturer`**: (string) The device manufacturer. Example: "Apple", "Samsung".
- **`modelId`**: (string) The device model identifier. Example: "iPhone14,2", "SM-S908U1".
- **`modelName`**: (string) The device model name. Example: "iPhone 13 Pro", "Galaxy S22 Ultra".
- **`product`**: (string) The product identifier. Example: "iPhone14,2", "SM-S908U1".
- **`supportedCpuArchitectures`**: `(Array<string>)` Returns a list of supported CPU architecture ABIs for the current device. For example: `["arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a", "armeabi"]`. _Android only_.
- **`totalMemory`**: (number) The total memory of the device in bytes. _Android and iOS Only_
- **`isDevice`**: (boolean) Returns `true` if the app is running on a real device. _Web only_.
- **`isHeadless`**: (boolean) Returns `true` if the app is running in a headless environment (e.g., server-side rendering).
- **`isRootedExperimental`**: (boolean) Returns `true` if the device has root access (jailbroken on iOS, rooted on Android). _Experimental API_.

**Important Notes on Unique Identifiers:**

- **Privacy:** Be extremely cautious when using unique identifiers like `osBuildId` or `product`. Always respect user privacy and follow relevant guidelines (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Best Practices:** Consider using less persistent identifiers or aggregated data for analytics whenever possible.
- **User Consent:** If you need to use unique identifiers, obtain explicit user consent and clearly explain how the data will be used.

### Methods

- **`getMaxMemoryAsync()`**: `(Promise<number>)` Returns the maximum memory available to the app in bytes. Available on iOS and Android.
- **`getUptimeAsync()`**: `(Promise<number>)` Returns the time in milliseconds that the system has been running since it was last booted.
- **`isAudioRecordingSupported()`**: `(Promise<boolean>)` Returns `true` if the device supports audio recording.
- **`isVideoRecordingSupported()`**: `(Promise<boolean>)` Returns `true` if the device supports video recording.

## Advanced Examples

### Conditional Feature Enabling

Let's say you want to enable a specific feature only for tablet devices:

```plaintext
import * as Device from 'expo-device'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [isTablet, setIsTablet] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsTablet(Device.deviceType === 'tablet')
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Device Information</Text>
      {isTablet ? (
        <Text>Tablet Mode: Feature X is enabled!</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>Mobile Mode: Feature X is disabled.</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
})
```

This code checks the `Device.deviceType` and enables or disables the feature accordingly.

### Gathering Device Information for Analytics

You can collect device information to gain insights into your user base. Here's an example of sending device data to an analytics service (replace `yourAnalyticsService` with your actual service):

```plaintext
import * as Device from 'expo-device'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

const sendDeviceInfoToAnalytics = async () => {
  const deviceInfo = {
    brand: Device.brand,
    deviceName: await Device.deviceName,
    osName: Device.osName,
    osVersion: Device.osVersion,
    modelName: Device.modelName,
    deviceType: Device.deviceType,
  }

  // Replace with your analytics service
  console.log('Sending device info to Analytics: ', deviceInfo)
  // await yourAnalyticsService.trackEvent('device_info', deviceInfo);
}

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    sendDeviceInfoToAnalytics()
  }, [])

  return (
    // ... your app UI
    <View>
      <Text>Check your console to see the analytics sending mock</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

Remember to handle data privacy appropriately and obtain user consent if necessary.

### Detecting Rooted/Jailbroken Devices

Detecting rooted or jailbroken devices can be useful for security purposes. However, it is important to note that the results of `Device.isRootedExperimental` can sometimes be unreliable:

```plaintext
import * as Device from 'expo-device'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [isRooted, setIsRooted] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsRooted(Device.isRootedExperimental)
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Device Information</Text>
      {isRooted ? (
        <Text>Warning: Rooted/Jailbroken device detected!</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>Device is not rooted/jailbroken.</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
})
```

**Important:** Avoid relying solely on this property for critical security decisions. It's advisable to use multiple methods to verify the device's integrity.

## Permissions (Android)

On Android API level 33 and higher, you might need to request the `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE` permission to access some device information, specifically `deviceName`. Add the following to your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "permissions": ["READ_PHONE_STATE"]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`deviceName` returns `null` or undefined:** Ensure that you are using the `await` keyword when accessing the `deviceName` property, as it's an asynchronous operation. Also make sure, on Android API 33 and higher, you've requested and received the `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission.
- **Inconsistent results on different devices:** Device manufacturers and operating system versions can sometimes report information differently. Test your application on a variety of devices to ensure compatibility.
- **Web Support:** Many of the `expo-device` features are not applicable or available in a web browser environment, and `isDevice` property can be used to detect if running on a real device instead of web.
