# Canary Deployments in Kubernetes with Flask: A Step-by-Step Guide

Canary deployments are a powerful deployment strategy that allows you to release new versions of your application to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire infrastructure. This provides a safety net for identifying and addressing any issues that might arise in a production environment with minimal impact on your users.  This guide focuses on implementing canary deployments for Flask applications within a Kubernetes cluster. We'll walk through the process step-by-step, providing code examples and explanations along the way.

## What are Canary Deployments?

In a canary deployment, you deploy the new version of your application alongside the existing stable version.  A small percentage of your traffic is then routed to the new version, while the majority continues to flow to the old version.  This allows you to:

*   **Test in a Real-World Environment:**  The new version is exposed to real user traffic, providing valuable insights into its performance and stability.
*   **Minimize Risk:**  If problems arise, you can quickly revert to the stable version, minimizing the impact on your users.
*   **Gradual Rollout:**  Increase the traffic routed to the new version gradually, monitoring its performance at each stage.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:**  Use monitoring and logging to make informed decisions about whether to continue the rollout or revert to the previous version.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **A Kubernetes Cluster:** You'll need access to a Kubernetes cluster. This could be a local cluster (like Minikube or Kind), or a managed cluster on a cloud provider (like GKE, AKS, or EKS).
*   **kubectl:** The Kubernetes command-line tool.  Make sure it's configured to connect to your cluster.
*   **Helm (Optional):** Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that can simplify deployment management. While not strictly required, it can make the process easier.
*   **Basic Kubernetes Knowledge:** Familiarity with Kubernetes concepts like Pods, Deployments, Services, and Ingress.
*   **Python and Flask:**  Python and the Flask framework installed on your development machine.

## Step 1: Create a Simple Flask Application

Let's start by creating a basic Flask application:

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

VERSION = os.environ.get("VERSION", "v1") # Default version is v1

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return f"Hello, Canary Deployment! Version: {VERSION}\n"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

This simple application defines a single route `/` that returns a greeting message, including the application's version.  The version is read from an environment variable `VERSION`, allowing us to easily differentiate between different deployments.  We set a default version of "v1".

Create a `requirements.txt` file:

```
Flask
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Dockerize the Flask Application

To deploy our Flask application to Kubernetes, we need to package it as a Docker image. Create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory as your `app.py` file:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t flask-canary:latest .
```

You should consider pushing this image to a container registry like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). For this example, let's assume you have pushed the image to Docker Hub under the name `your-dockerhub-username/flask-canary`.

**Important:**  Remember to replace `your-dockerhub-username` with your actual Docker Hub username.

## Step 3: Define Kubernetes Deployments

Now, let's define the Kubernetes deployments for our application. We'll create two deployments: one for the stable version (v1) and one for the canary version (v2).

**stable-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
# stable-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-stable
  labels:
    app: flask-canary
    version: v1
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-canary
      version: v1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-canary
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flask-canary
        image: your-dockerhub-username/flask-canary:latest # Replace with your image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        env:
        - name: VERSION
          value: "v1"
```

**canary-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
# canary-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-canary
  labels:
    app: flask-canary
    version: v2
spec:
  replicas: 1 # Start with a single replica for the canary
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-canary
      version: v2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-canary
        version: v2
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flask-canary
        image: your-dockerhub-username/flask-canary:latest # Replace with your image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        env:
        - name: VERSION
          value: "v2" # Explicitly set the version to v2
```

**Key points:**

*   Both deployments use the same Docker image (`your-dockerhub-username/flask-canary:latest`), but they are distinguished by the `version` label and the `VERSION` environment variable.
*   The stable deployment has 3 replicas, while the canary deployment starts with only 1 replica.
*   The `selector` in each deployment matches the `labels` in the corresponding pod template.  This ensures that the deployment controls only the pods with the matching labels.

## Step 4: Define a Kubernetes Service

We need a service to expose our Flask application.  The service will route traffic to both the stable and canary deployments based on labels.

**service.yaml**

```yaml
# service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flask-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: flask-canary
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 5000
  type: ClusterIP
```

This service selects all pods with the label `app: flask-canary`. This might seem problematic, but Kubernetes services route traffic to *all* pods matching the selector, regardless of their other labels (like `version`).  We'll use an Ingress controller to control how traffic is routed to the different versions.

## Step 5: Configure Ingress for Traffic Routing

Ingress allows external access to the services within your Kubernetes cluster. We'll use Ingress to route a small percentage of traffic to the canary deployment based on a specific header. You'll need an Ingress controller installed in your cluster (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller).  How you install it depends on your Kubernetes provider.

**ingress.yaml**

```yaml
# ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: flask-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header: "version"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header-value: "v2"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: your-domain.com # Replace with your domain
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: flask-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"`:**  Enables canary deployment functionality.
*   **`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header: "version"`:**  Specifies that traffic should be routed based on the value of the `version` header.
*   **`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header-value: "v2"`:** Routes traffic to the canary deployment (v2) if the `version` header is set to `v2`.
*   **`host: your-domain.com`:**  Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain. You will need to set up DNS records to point your domain to the Ingress controller's external IP address.
*   **`backend.service.name: flask-service`:**  Specifies the service to which the Ingress should route traffic.

**Alternative Routing Strategies:**

*   **Canary by Weight:**  Instead of using a header, you can route traffic based on a percentage using annotations like `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "10"` (to route 10% of traffic to the canary).
*   **Canary by Cookie:** Route traffic based on the presence and value of a specific cookie.

## Step 6: Deploy the Application

Now, apply the Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f stable-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f canary-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

## Step 7: Test the Canary Deployment

Now, test your canary deployment:

1.  **Without the Header:** Access your application via your domain (e.g., `http://your-domain.com`). You should primarily see responses from the stable version (v1). Due to the service selecting all pods, you might intermittently see the canary version, especially if you only have one stable replica.
2.  **With the Header:**  Send a request with the `version: v2` header. You should consistently see responses from the canary version (v2).

    ```bash
    curl -H "version: v2" http://your-domain.com
    ```

You can use tools like `watch` or a script to repeatedly send requests and observe the distribution of responses.

## Step 8: Monitoring and Rollout

Carefully monitor the canary deployment for any errors, performance issues, or unexpected behavior.  Use your existing monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack) to track key metrics like:

*   Error rates
*   Response times
*   CPU usage
*   Memory usage

If the canary deployment performs well, you can gradually increase the traffic routed to it by adjusting the canary weight or other routing rules. You can also increase the number of replicas in the canary deployment.

**Example: Scaling the Canary Deployment**

```bash
kubectl scale deployment flask-canary --replicas=3
```

## Step 9: Complete Rollout or Rollback

*   **Complete Rollout:**  If the canary deployment proves successful, you can fully roll out the new version by:
    1.  Scaling down the stable deployment to zero replicas.
    2.  Scaling up the canary deployment to the desired number of replicas.
    3.  Removing the canary annotations from the Ingress.
    4.  Updating the `version` label on the main service selector.
    5.  Potentially rename the deployment for v2 to flask-stable and remove the original v1 deployment manifest

*   **Rollback:**  If problems arise with the canary deployment, you can quickly revert to the stable version by:
    1.  Scaling down the canary deployment to zero replicas.
    2.  Ensuring the stable deployment is at the desired number of replicas.
    3.  Removing the canary annotations from the Ingress.

## Conclusion

Canary deployments provide a safe and controlled way to release new versions of your Flask applications on Kubernetes. By carefully monitoring the canary deployment and gradually increasing traffic, you can minimize the risk of introducing bugs or performance issues into your production environment. Remember to choose the routing strategy that best suits your needs and to adapt the provided examples to your specific application and infrastructure.  This approach allows for data-driven decisions, ensuring a smooth and reliable rollout process.
