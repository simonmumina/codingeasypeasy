# Mastering Environment Variables in Expo: A Comprehensive Guide

Managing configuration settings, API keys, and secrets securely is a crucial aspect of any mobile application development. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to effectively utilize environment variables within your Expo React Native projects. We'll cover various methods, from simple `.env` files to more advanced techniques using `expo-constants` and integrating with EAS Build.

## Why Use Environment Variables?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand why environment variables are so important:

- **Security:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or private tokens directly into your code. This prevents accidental exposure when committing to version control systems like Git.
- **Configuration Management:** Easily switch between different configurations for development, staging, and production environments without modifying your codebase. For example, you might have different API endpoints for each environment.
- **Maintainability:** Centralize your configuration settings in one place, making it easier to update and manage them.
- **Collaboration:** Allows developers to work with different configurations without impacting each other's environments.

## Method 1: Using `.env` Files with `dotenv`

The simplest and most common way to manage environment variables in Expo is by using `.env` files in conjunction with the `dotenv` library.

**Installation:**

First, install `dotenv` using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install dotenv
# or
yarn add dotenv
```

**Creating `.env` Files:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your Expo project. This file will contain your environment variables.

```
API_URL=https://api.example.com
API_KEY=your_secret_api_key
APP_NAME=MyApp
```

**Loading `.env` Variables in Expo:**

While `dotenv` is often used in Node.js projects, Expo (and React Native) require a slight modification to make it work. The easiest way to do this is through the `babel-preset-expo` configuration. Modify your `babel.config.js` (or create one if it doesn't exist) to include `react-native-dotenv`:

```plaintext
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      [
        'module:react-native-dotenv',
        {
          moduleName: '@env',
          path: '.env',
          blacklist: null,
          whitelist: null,
          safe: false,
          allowUndefined: true,
        },
      ],
    ],
  }
}
```

**Explanation of `react-native-dotenv` configuration options:**

- **`moduleName`**: The name of the module used to import environment variables (defaults to `@env`).
- **`path`**: The path to your `.env` file (defaults to `.env`).
- **`blacklist`**: An array of variable names to exclude from the environment variables.
- **`whitelist`**: An array of variable names to include from the environment variables. If specified, only the variables in the whitelist will be available.
- **`safe`**: If set to `true`, throws an error if any of the specified variables are not defined in the `.env` file. Useful for ensuring critical variables are always set.
- **`allowUndefined`**: If set to `true` (default), accessing a non-existent variable will return `undefined`. If `false`, it will throw an error.

**Accessing Environment Variables in Your Code:**

Now you can import your environment variables in your React Native components:

```plaintext
import { API_URL, API_KEY, APP_NAME } from '@env'
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>API URL: {API_URL}</Text>
      <Text>API Key: {API_KEY}</Text>
      <Text>App Name: {APP_NAME}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **`.gitignore`:** Add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing it to your repository. This is _critical_ to avoid exposing sensitive information.
- **Development vs. Production:** In a real-world scenario, you'll have different `.env` files for different environments (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`, `.env.staging`). You'll need a mechanism to dynamically load the correct `.env` file based on the current environment. This can be achieved using conditional logic within your `babel.config.js` or by using different build scripts. However, for Expo projects using EAS Build (covered later), EAS handles this automatically through build profiles.

## Method 2: Using `expo-constants`

`expo-constants` provides a built-in mechanism for accessing environment variables in your Expo projects. It's particularly well-suited for accessing configuration values that are known at build time.

**Installation:**

`expo-constants` is typically included by default in Expo projects. If you don't have it, install it:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-constants
# or
yarn add expo-constants
```

**Configuring `app.json` (or `app.config.js`):**

Define your environment variables within the `extra` field of your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file:

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "slug": "myapp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "extra": {
      "API_URL": "https://api.example.com",
      "API_KEY": "your_secret_api_key",
      "APP_NAME": "MyApp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or, using `app.config.js`:

```plaintext
export default {
  expo: {
    name: 'MyApp',
    slug: 'myapp',
    version: '1.0.0',
    extra: {
      API_URL: process.env.API_URL || 'https://default-api.example.com', // Example with default
      API_KEY: process.env.API_KEY,
      APP_NAME: 'MyApp',
    },
  },
}
```

Using `app.config.js` gives you the flexibility to use environment variables available _during the build process_ (e.g., those set in your CI/CD pipeline or on your local machine). This is very useful for dynamic configuration. Notice the use of `process.env.API_URL` with a default value. This allows you to have a default API URL if the `API_URL` environment variable is not set when the app is built. **Important:** These environment variables are evaluated at _build time_, not runtime.

**Accessing Environment Variables in Your Code:**

Import and access the variables using `expo-constants`:

```plaintext
import Constants from 'expo-constants'
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { API_URL, API_KEY, APP_NAME } = Constants.expoConfig.extra

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>API URL: {API_URL}</Text>
      <Text>API Key: {API_KEY}</Text>
      <Text>App Name: {APP_NAME}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Advantages of `expo-constants`:**

- **Built-in:** No need for extra dependencies.
- **Simplified Configuration:** Configuration is managed directly within your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.

**Disadvantages of `expo-constants`:**

- **Not Suitable for Runtime Secrets:** Values are baked into the build at build time. This is _not_ secure for sensitive runtime secrets that should not be stored in the compiled app.
- **Limited Flexibility:** Modifying variables after building the app requires rebuilding and redeploying.

## Method 3: Using EAS Build with Build Profiles

Expo Application Services (EAS) Build provides a powerful way to manage environment variables for different build configurations (e.g., development, staging, production). EAS Build profiles offer the most robust and secure solution, especially when dealing with sensitive information.

**Prerequisites:**

- An Expo account and project.
- EAS CLI installed: `npm install -g eas-cli`
- A working EAS project (initialized with `eas init`).

**Configuring EAS Build Profiles:**

Edit your `eas.json` file to define your build profiles. Each profile can have its own set of environment variables.

```plaintext
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "API_URL": "https://dev-api.example.com",
        "API_KEY": "dev_api_key"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "env": {
        "API_URL": "https://staging-api.example.com",
        "API_KEY": "staging_api_key"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "env": {
        "API_URL": "https://api.example.com",
        "API_KEY": "production_api_key"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

In this example:

- **`development`:** A development build configuration using the Expo Go client.
- **`preview`:** A staging build configuration.
- **`production`:** A production build configuration.

Each profile defines its own `env` object, containing the environment variables specific to that environment.

**Accessing EAS Build Environment Variables in Your Code:**

The EAS Build environment variables are automatically injected into the build process and are accessible via `process.env`. You should access these variables in your `app.config.js` file, which will be evaluated _during the build process_.

```plaintext
export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    extra: {
      API_URL: process.env.API_URL || 'https://default-api.example.com',
      API_KEY: process.env.API_KEY,
      APP_NAME: config.name,
      eas: {
        projectId: 'your-eas-project-id', // replace with your project id.  Found on expo.dev
      },
    },
  }
}
```

**Triggering a Build with EAS Build:**

Run the following command to trigger a build using a specific profile:

```plaintext
eas build -p android --profile production
# or
eas build -p ios --profile development
```

EAS Build will automatically inject the environment variables defined in the specified profile into the build process.

**Advantages of EAS Build Profiles:**

- **Secure Secrets Management:** EAS Build securely manages your environment variables and prevents them from being exposed in your codebase.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Easily switch between different configurations for different environments.
- **Integration with EAS Infrastructure:** Seamlessly integrated with EAS Build and EAS Submit.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Allows you to configure values at _build time_, enabling you to tailor your application to different environments.

**Security Considerations for EAS Secrets:**

For truly sensitive secrets that should _never_ be stored in your application code or configuration files, consider using EAS Secrets. EAS Secrets allows you to securely store secrets that are injected into your build environment _only at build time_. These secrets are not accessible from the application code itself, providing an extra layer of security. This requires some changes to the build process, often involving backend services or other tooling.

**Using EAS Secrets (Conceptual):**

1.  **Store the secret:** Use the EAS CLI to store your secret: `eas secret:create MY_DATABASE_PASSWORD`
2.  **Reference the secret in `eas.json`:** Instead of directly specifying a value for an environment variable, reference the secret:

    ```plaintext
    {
      "build": {
        "production": {
          "env": {
            "DATABASE_PASSWORD": "$MY_DATABASE_PASSWORD"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Access the value:** The `DATABASE_PASSWORD` environment variable will be available during the build process, and you can access it from your `app.config.js`. _Crucially_, the actual secret value is never stored in your `eas.json` file or your application code.

## Best Practices for Managing Environment Variables in Expo

- **Never Commit Sensitive Information:** Always add your `.env` files to your `.gitignore` file. Use EAS Secrets for highly sensitive information.
- **Use Descriptive Variable Names:** Choose clear and descriptive names for your environment variables to improve code readability.
- **Provide Default Values:** In your `app.config.js`, provide default values for environment variables to prevent errors if they are not set.
- **Separate Configurations:** Use different `.env` files or EAS Build profiles for different environments.
- **Validate Environment Variables:** Consider adding validation logic to your application to ensure that critical environment variables are set and have the correct values.
- **Prefer Build-Time Configuration:** Whenever possible, configure values at build time using `app.config.js` and EAS Build profiles. This allows you to tailor your application to different environments without modifying your codebase.
- **Consider a Configuration Service (Advanced):** For more complex scenarios, especially when dealing with runtime secrets, consider using a configuration service that can dynamically provide configuration values to your application at runtime. This requires more advanced architecture and infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Effectively managing environment variables is crucial for building secure, maintainable, and configurable Expo React Native applications. By combining `.env` files with `expo-constants` and EAS Build profiles, you can create a robust and secure environment variable strategy for your projects. Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices to protect your sensitive information. Choosing the right method depends on the specific needs of your project and the level of security required. For simple development and testing, `.env` files might suffice. For production deployments, EAS Build profiles and EAS Secrets are highly recommended.
