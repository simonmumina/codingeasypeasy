# Sharing Vue Components Between Micro-Frontends: Strategies & Best Practices

Micro-frontends are revolutionizing the way we build large, complex web applications. By breaking down a monolithic frontend into smaller, independent, and manageable pieces, we gain benefits like increased development speed, improved team autonomy, and easier deployments. However, a common challenge arises: how do we maintain a consistent user experience and avoid code duplication when components need to be shared between these micro-frontends?

This article explores different strategies for sharing Vue components across micro-frontends, weighing their pros and cons, and providing practical code examples to help you choose the best approach for your specific needs.

## Why Share Components in a Micro-Frontend Architecture?

Before diving into the "how," let's understand the "why." Sharing components offers several key advantages:

- **Consistency:** Ensures a unified look and feel across the entire application, preventing a fragmented user experience.
- **Code Reuse:** Reduces duplication, leading to a smaller codebase, easier maintenance, and faster development cycles.
- **Maintainability:** Updates and bug fixes to shared components are propagated across all micro-frontends, simplifying maintenance.
- **Performance:** Avoids the overhead of loading the same component multiple times in different micro-frontends.

## Strategies for Sharing Vue Components

Here are some popular strategies for sharing Vue components, each with its own trade-offs:

1.  **Web Components (Custom Elements):**
2.  **Shared Component Library (Package):**
3.  **Module Federation (Webpack 5):**
4.  **Iframe Approach (Generally Discouraged):**
5.  **Single-Spa with Shared Vue Instance (Framework Dependent):**

Let's delve into each of these strategies with code examples.

### 1. Web Components (Custom Elements)

Web Components allow you to create reusable custom HTML elements with encapsulated styling and logic. You can register your Vue components as custom elements, making them accessible to any web application, regardless of the underlying framework.

**Pros:**

- **Framework-agnostic:** Works with any JavaScript framework or even without one.
- **Encapsulation:** Style and behavior are encapsulated within the custom element.
- **Standardized:** Uses native web standards.

**Cons:**

- **Initial learning curve:** Understanding Shadow DOM and custom element APIs.
- **Data passing complexity:** Can be more complex than using props directly.
- **Browser compatibility:** While broadly supported, polyfills may be needed for older browsers (although usually automatically handled by the build tool).

**Example:**

First, install the `@vue/web-component-wrapper` package:

```plaintext
npm install @vue/web-component-wrapper
# or
yarn add @vue/web-component-wrapper
```

**Vue Component (`src/components/MyButton.vue`):**

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">{{ label }}</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    label: {
      type: String,
      default: 'Click Me',
    },
  },
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.$emit('button-clicked')
    },
  },
}
</script>

<style scoped>
button {
  background-color: #4caf50; /* Green */
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
</style>
```

**Registering the Component as a Custom Element (`src/main.js` or a dedicated file):**

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import wrap from '@vue/web-component-wrapper'
import MyButton from './components/MyButton.vue'

const MyButtonWC = wrap(Vue, MyButton)

window.customElements.define('my-button', MyButtonWC)
```

**Using the Web Component in Another Micro-Frontend (or any HTML file):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Web Component Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <my-button label="My Custom Button"></my-button>

    <script>
      // Listen for the 'button-clicked' event
      document.querySelector('my-button').addEventListener('button-clicked', function () {
        alert('Button clicked in the host application!')
      })
    </script>

    <!-- Assuming MyButtonWC is available globally via a script tag
       or a build process that makes it available. -->
    <script src="path/to/my-button-wc.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- The `@vue/web-component-wrapper` helps convert a Vue component into a standard web component.
- `window.customElements.define('my-button', MyButtonWC)` registers the component with the browser, making it available as `<my-button>`.
- You can pass data using attributes (e.g., `label="My Custom Button"`).
- Events can be emitted from the web component and listened to in the host application. You will need to use the correct event delegation to listen to these events if your component is created dynamically.

**Important Considerations for Web Components:**

- **Shadow DOM Styling:** Styles defined within the web component's Shadow DOM are encapsulated and don't leak to the outside. This can be both a benefit and a challenge. You might need to use CSS variables or CSS parts for styling customization from the outside.
- **Event Handling:** Events emitted from inside the Shadow DOM are retargeted. You might need to handle this retargeting when listening for events on your web component.

### 2. Shared Component Library (Package)

Create a separate Vue project as a component library and publish it as an npm package. Each micro-frontend can then install this package and import the shared components.

**Pros:**

- **Clean separation of concerns:** The component library is a separate, well-defined project.
- **Version control:** Easily manage versions and updates of shared components.
- **Testability:** Shared components can be thoroughly tested in isolation.

**Cons:**

- **Dependency management:** Each micro-frontend needs to manage the component library as a dependency.
- **Release process:** Requires publishing new versions of the library when changes are made.
- **Potential for bloat:** Micro-frontends might import components they don't actually use, increasing bundle size (tree shaking can help mitigate this).

**Example:**

**1. Create a new Vue project for the component library:**

```plaintext
vue create my-component-library
cd my-component-library
```

**2. Develop your shared components (e.g., `src/components/MySharedButton.vue`):**

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">{{ text }}</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    text: {
      type: String,
      default: 'Shared Button',
    },
  },
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.$emit('clicked')
    },
  },
}
</script>
```

**3. Export the components in `src/index.js`:**

```javascript
import MySharedButton from './components/MySharedButton.vue'

export { MySharedButton }
```

**4. Configure `vue.config.js` to build as a library (important for proper bundling):**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  chainWebpack: (config) => {
    config.optimization.delete('splitChunks')
  },
  configureWebpack: {
    output: {
      libraryExport: 'default', // Ensure the exported value is under 'default'
    },
  },
}
```

**5. Configure `package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-component-library",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/my-component-library.common.js",
  "module": "dist/my-component-library.esm.js",
  "files": ["dist/*"],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vue-cli-service build --target lib --name my-component-library src/index.js",
    "publish-package": "npm run build && npm publish"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "core-js": "^3.6.5",
    "vue": "^2.6.11"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vue/cli-plugin-babel": "~4.5.15",
    "@vue/cli-service": "~4.5.15",
    "vue-template-compiler": "^2.6.11"
  }
}
```

**Explanation of changes to package.json:**

- `"main"`: Specifies the entry point for CommonJS environments.
- `"module"`: Specifies the entry point for ES module environments (used by modern bundlers).
- `"files"`: Lists the files to be included when the package is published.
- `"build"` script: Uses the Vue CLI to build the library. `--target lib` specifies that we are building a library, `--name` sets the library name, and `src/index.js` is the entry point.
- `"publish-package"`: Builds and publishes the package to NPM.

**6. Build and Publish the Package:**

```plaintext
npm run publish-package
```

**(You might need to login to npm first using `npm login`.)**

**7. Install the Package in Your Micro-Frontends:**

```plaintext
cd micro-frontend-app
npm install my-component-library
# or
yarn add my-component-library
```

**8. Import and Use the Components:**

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>My Micro-Frontend</h1>
    <MySharedButton text="Click Me from the Library" @clicked="showAlert" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { MySharedButton } from 'my-component-library'

export default {
  components: {
    MySharedButton,
  },
  methods: {
    showAlert() {
      alert('Button clicked in the micro-frontend!')
    },
  },
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- The `my-component-library` package is installed as a dependency.
- The `MySharedButton` component is imported from the package.
- It's then registered as a component in your Vue micro-frontend.

**Important Considerations for Shared Component Libraries:**

- **Versioning:** Use semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage updates and avoid breaking changes.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your shared components in isolation before publishing.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation on how to use the shared components.
- **Tree shaking:** Ensure your component library is tree-shakeable so that micro-frontends only import the components they actually use. Configuration in `vue.config.js` and `package.json` plays a vital role here.

### 3. Module Federation (Webpack 5)

Module Federation, introduced in Webpack 5, allows JavaScript applications to dynamically load code from each other at runtime. This is a powerful way to share components and functionality between micro-frontends without needing to publish and install separate packages.

**Pros:**

- **Dynamic sharing:** Components are loaded on demand, reducing initial bundle size.
- **Simplified dependency management:** Reduces the need for shared dependencies.
- **Improved developer experience:** Changes in one micro-frontend can be quickly reflected in others.
- **Live updates:** Enables live updates of shared components without redeploying all micro-frontends (with proper caching and versioning strategies).

**Cons:**

- **Webpack 5 required:** Requires upgrading to Webpack 5.
- **More complex configuration:** Involves configuring Module Federation in each micro-frontend.
- **Potential runtime errors:** Can be challenging to debug runtime errors related to shared modules.
- **Versioning still important:** Even with dynamic loading, version compatibility is key to avoid runtime issues.

**Example:**

Let's say you have two micro-frontends: `app1` and `app2`. We want to share a button component from `app1` to `app2`.

**1. Configure `app1` (the component provider):**

Install required packages (adjust versions as needed):

```plaintext
cd app1
npm install @originjs/vite-plugin-federation -D
npm install vue@^2.7.14 -S
```

Create `vite.config.js` (or update your existing one):

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue2'
import federation from '@originjs/vite-plugin-federation'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue(),
    federation({
      name: 'app1',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './MySharedButton': './src/components/MySharedButton.vue',
      },
      shared: ['vue'], // Important for Vue to avoid multiple copies in the bundle. Also needs to be present in app2
    }),
  ],
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',
    minify: false,
    cssCodeSplit: false,
  },
})
```

**`src/components/MySharedButton.vue` (the shared component):**

```vue
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">{{ text }}</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    text: {
      type: String,
      default: 'Shared Button from App1',
    },
  },
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.$emit('clicked')
    },
  },
}
</script>
```

**2. Configure `app2` (the component consumer):**

Install required packages:

```plaintext
cd app2
npm install @originjs/vite-plugin-federation -D
npm install vue@^2.7.14 -S
```

Create `vite.config.js` (or update your existing one):

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue2'
import federation from '@originjs/vite-plugin-federation'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue(),
    federation({
      name: 'app2',
      remotes: {
        app1: 'http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js', // Replace with the actual URL of app1
      },
      shared: ['vue'], // Important for Vue!
    }),
  ],
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',
    minify: false,
    cssCodeSplit: false,
  },
})
```

**Using the Shared Component in `app2` (`src/App.vue` or another component):**

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>App 2</h1>
    <MySharedButton text="Click Me from App1" @clicked="showAlert" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'

export default {
  components: {
    MySharedButton: defineAsyncComponent(() => import('app1/MySharedButton')),
  },
  methods: {
    showAlert() {
      alert('Button clicked in App2, originating from App1!')
    },
  },
}
</script>
```

**Important Notes for Module Federation with Vue 2 and Vite:**

- **`@originjs/vite-plugin-federation`:** Use this plugin specifically for Vite + Module Federation (community maintained and generally works well).
- **`shared: ['vue']`:** This is **crucial** to avoid loading multiple instances of Vue. Include it in _both_ the providing and consuming applications. Ensure the Vue versions match (or are compatible) for both.
- **`defineAsyncComponent`:** Use `defineAsyncComponent` from Vue to load the remote component dynamically. This is generally recommended.
- **`target: 'esnext'` and `minify: false`:** These settings are often necessary for Module Federation to work correctly with Vite during development. You might adjust them for production builds.
- **Consistent Vue Version:** Ensure that both micro-frontends are using the same version of Vue (or at least a compatible version). This is vital to prevent runtime errors.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch potential issues during runtime module loading.
- **URL Configuration:** Make sure the `remoteEntry.js` URL is correct and accessible from `app2`.

**Explanation:**

- In `app1`, we expose the `MySharedButton` component through Module Federation.
- In `app2`, we define a remote entry point that points to `app1`.
- We use `defineAsyncComponent` to dynamically import the shared component from `app1`.

**Running the Example:**

1.  Start `app1` (e.g., `npm run dev` in `app1`).
2.  Start `app2` (e.g., `npm run dev` in `app2`).

Now, when you visit `app2`, you should see the shared button from `app1` rendered.

### 4. Iframe Approach (Generally Discouraged)

Embed each micro-frontend within an `<iframe>`.

**Pros:**

- **Isolation:** Micro-frontends are completely isolated from each other.
- **Technology agnostic:** Each iframe can use a different technology stack.

**Cons:**

- **Poor user experience:** Can lead to a fragmented and disjointed user experience.
- **Communication challenges:** Communicating between iframes is complex.
- **SEO issues:** Iframes can negatively impact SEO.
- **Accessibility issues:** Can create accessibility issues.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Iframe Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Main Application</h1>

    <iframe src="http://localhost:3000"></iframe>
    <iframe src="http://localhost:3001"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Why this is generally discouraged:**

The iframe approach is generally not recommended due to its significant drawbacks. It should only be considered as a last resort when other options are not feasible. Communication between iframes is difficult and involves using `postMessage` which can be complex to manage.

### 5. Single-Spa with Shared Vue Instance (Framework Dependent)

Single-Spa is a meta-framework that allows you to combine multiple JavaScript frameworks in a single page. With Single-Spa, you can share a single Vue instance between multiple Vue micro-frontends.

**Pros:**

- **Shared state management:** Easier to share state between micro-frontends.
- **Improved performance:** Avoids loading multiple Vue instances.
- **Centralized routing:** Single-Spa handles routing between micro-frontends.

**Cons:**

- **Tight coupling:** Micro-frontends are more tightly coupled to each other.
- **Single-Spa required:** Requires adopting Single-Spa as your meta-framework.
- **More complex setup:** Setting up Single-Spa can be more complex than other approaches.

**Example (Conceptual):**

This example shows the high level idea, implementing Single-Spa is outside the scope of this document. You'd need to refer to the Single-Spa documentation for detailed instructions.

1.  **Install Single-Spa and Vue:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install single-spa vue
    ```

2.  **Create Single-Spa Applications:** Each micro-frontend would be a Single-Spa application.

3.  **Register Applications:** Register the applications within the root Single-Spa application.

4.  **Shared Vue Instance (Crucial):** You will need to ensure that each application uses the **same** Vue instance. This usually involves configuring Webpack or another module bundler to share the Vue dependency.

**Key Configuration:**

```javascript
// In your root Single-Spa application:
import * as singleSpa from 'single-spa'
import Vue from 'vue' // Import Vue in the root app to make it available

singleSpa.registerApplication(
  'app1',
  () => import('app1/src/main.js'), // App 1 entry point
  (location) => location.pathname.startsWith('/app1')
)

singleSpa.registerApplication(
  'app2',
  () => import('app2/src/main.js'), // App 2 entry point
  (location) => location.pathname.startsWith('/app2')
)

singleSpa.start()
```

**Important Considerations for Single-Spa:**

- **Shared Dependencies:** Properly configure your bundler to share dependencies like Vue, Vuex, and Vue Router to avoid duplication and conflicts.
- **Global State Management:** Use a shared state management solution (e.g., Vuex) to manage state across micro-frontends. Be aware of potential naming collisions in global state.
- **Routing:** Single-Spa handles routing between applications.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent errors in one application from affecting others.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

The best strategy for sharing Vue components between micro-frontends depends on your specific requirements and constraints. Consider the following factors:

- **Framework Agnosticism:** Do you need to share components with applications that are not using Vue? If so, Web Components might be the best choice.
- **Complexity:** How complex is your application architecture? If you have a relatively simple architecture, a shared component library might be sufficient.
- **Performance:** How important is performance? Module Federation can provide better performance by dynamically loading components.
- **Team Autonomy:** How important is team autonomy? If you want teams to be able to develop and deploy micro-frontends independently, Module Federation or Web Components might be a better choice.
- **Development Speed:** Do you want faster development times? Module Federation offers improved developer experience with live updates.
- **Existing Infrastructure:** Do you already have a micro-frontend framework in place (e.g., Single-Spa)? If so, you might want to leverage its component sharing capabilities.

Here's a quick summary table to help you decide:

| Strategy                   | Pros                                                                                           | Cons                                                                                                 | Use Cases                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Web Components             | Framework-agnostic, Encapsulation, Standardized                                                | Initial learning curve, Data passing complexity, Browser compatibility (minor, polyfills can help)   | Sharing components across different frameworks or with non-framework applications.                                       |
| Shared Component Library   | Clean separation of concerns, Version control, Testability                                     | Dependency management, Release process, Potential for bloat (mitigated by tree-shaking)              | Sharing components within a Vue-centric ecosystem where a well-defined component library is desired.                     |
| Module Federation          | Dynamic sharing, Simplified dependency management, Improved developer experience, Live updates | Webpack 5 required, More complex configuration, Potential runtime errors, Versioning still important | Sharing components between Vue micro-frontends that require dynamic loading and a more streamlined development workflow. |
| Iframe Approach            | Isolation, Technology agnostic                                                                 | Poor user experience, Communication challenges, SEO issues, Accessibility issues                     | Only as a last resort when other options are not feasible. Generally discouraged.                                        |
| Single-Spa with Shared Vue | Shared state management, Improved performance, Centralized routing                             | Tight coupling, Single-Spa required, More complex setup                                              | When using Single-Spa as your meta-framework and require shared state and routing between Vue micro-frontends.           |

## Conclusion

Sharing Vue components between micro-frontends is essential for building consistent and maintainable applications. By understanding the different strategies available and weighing their pros and cons, you can choose the best approach for your specific needs. Remember to consider factors like framework agnosticism, complexity, performance, and team autonomy when making your decision. Good luck!
