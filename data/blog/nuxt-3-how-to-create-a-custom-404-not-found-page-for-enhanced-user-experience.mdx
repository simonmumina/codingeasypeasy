# Nuxt 3: How to Create a Custom 404 (Not Found) Page for Enhanced User Experience

A well-designed and informative 404 (Not Found) page is crucial for any website. When users encounter a broken link or type in an incorrect URL, a generic server error can leave them frustrated and likely to leave your site. A custom 404 page, on the other hand, can:

- **Improve User Experience:** Guide users back to relevant content on your site.
- **Maintain Brand Consistency:** Keep the user within the same visual style and branding as the rest of your site.
- **Reduce Bounce Rate:** Offer helpful links or a search bar to encourage users to stay engaged.
- **Potential SEO Benefits:** A well-designed 404 page can indirectly improve your SEO by keeping users on your site longer.

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a custom 404 page in your Nuxt 3 application, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience even when things go wrong.

## Understanding the Nuxt 3 Directory Structure for Error Pages

Nuxt 3 simplifies the creation of custom error pages by providing a designated file location:

```
/pages/
  └── [catchall].vue
```

Any `.vue` file placed within the `pages` directory with a name starting with `[...` and ending with `].vue` or `]+.vue` becomes a dynamic route. In this case, `[catchall].vue` acts as a catch-all route, meaning it will be rendered for any URL that doesn't match an existing route defined in your `pages` directory. Nuxt handles the logic behind the scenes and understands that this is meant to be the 404 page.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing a Custom 404 Page

Let's create a simple yet effective custom 404 page.

**1. Create the `[catchall].vue` File:**

Within your `pages` directory, create a new file named `[catchall].vue`.

**2. Add the following code to `[catchall].vue`:**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>Oops! The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
    <p>You may have mistyped the address or the page may have been moved.</p>
    <nuxt-link to="/">
      <button>Go back to the homepage</button>
    </nuxt-link>

    <!-- Example:  Adding a site search component  -->
    <!-- <SiteSearch />  -->
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
// You can add logic here if needed, e.g., logging the error
// or fetching dynamic content.
useHead({
  title: '404 - Page Not Found',
  meta: [
    {
      name: 'description',
      content: 'Custom 404 page for this website.  The page you requested was not found.'
    }
  ]
});

//  Optional: Get the attempted path
const route = useRoute()
console.log('Attempted Path:', route.fullPath)
</script>

<style scoped>
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 50vh; /* Consider using viewport height */
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

p {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #007bff; /* Example:  Use your brand color */
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3; /* Example:  A slightly darker shade */
}
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`<template>`:** This section contains the HTML structure of your 404 page. It includes a heading, paragraph explaining the error, and a link back to the homepage using `<nuxt-link>`.
- **`<script setup>`:** This is where you can add JavaScript logic. In this example, we're using `useHead` to dynamically set the page title and meta description for SEO purposes. We're also logging the attempted route to the console (helpful for debugging).
- **`<style scoped>`:** This section contains CSS styles specific to this component. The `scoped` attribute ensures that these styles only apply to elements within this component, preventing conflicts with other styles on your site. Adjust the styles to match your website's design.

**3. Test Your 404 Page:**

Start your Nuxt development server (e.g., `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) and navigate to a non-existent URL on your site (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/this-page-does-not-exist`). You should see your custom 404 page.

## Enhancing Your 404 Page for Better User Experience

Here are some ideas to make your 404 page even more user-friendly:

- **Search Bar:** Include a search bar so users can easily find what they were looking for. You can implement this using a component like `<SiteSearch />` as shown in the commented-out example in the template.
- **Popular Links:** Display a list of your most popular pages or categories to help users find relevant content.
- **Contact Information:** Provide a way for users to contact you if they need help.
- **Humor and Personality:** Inject some humor or personality into your 404 page to make it less frustrating for users. Be careful to remain professional and on-brand.
- **Image or Illustration:** Add a relevant image or illustration to make the page visually appealing.
- **Dynamic Content:** Fetch dynamic content from your server to display personalized recommendations or helpful information. (Requires more advanced setup).

## Best Practices for 404 Pages and SEO

- **Use a 404 HTTP Status Code:** Ensure your server is sending a 404 HTTP status code when a page is not found. Nuxt automatically handles this when using the `[catchall].vue` approach. If you're using server middleware or other custom routing, double-check your configuration.
- **Avoid Redirecting to the Homepage:** Generally, avoid automatically redirecting users to the homepage. This can be confusing and may be interpreted as a soft 404 by search engines. Let the user know the page is missing.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Ensure your 404 page is responsive and looks good on all devices.
- **Clear and Concise Messaging:** Use clear and easy-to-understand language to explain the error.
- **Optimized Meta Data:** Use the `<script setup>` section of your `[catchall].vue` component to set the appropriate title and meta description for the 404 page, as shown in the example above. Focus on keywords that describe the "page not found" situation.

## Example: Adding a Search Bar (Component)

Let's assume you have a `components/SiteSearch.vue` component that provides a search bar for your website. You could integrate it into your 404 page like this:

**1. Create `components/SiteSearch.vue` (example):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <input type="text" v-model="searchQuery" placeholder="Search this site..." />
    <button @click="performSearch">Search</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router';

const searchQuery = ref('');
const router = useRouter();

const performSearch = () => {
  if (searchQuery.value) {
    router.push({ path: '/search', query: { q: searchQuery.value } });
  }
};
</script>
```

**2. Import and Use `SiteSearch` in `pages/[catchall].vue`:**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>Oops! The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
    <p>You may have mistyped the address or the page may have been moved.</p>
    <nuxt-link to="/">
      <button>Go back to the homepage</button>
    </nuxt-link>

    <!--  Import and Use the SiteSearch component -->
    <SiteSearch />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import SiteSearch from '~/components/SiteSearch.vue';  //  Adjust path if needed

useHead({
  title: '404 - Page Not Found',
  meta: [
    {
      name: 'description',
      content: 'Custom 404 page for this website.  The page you requested was not found.'
    }
  ]
});

const route = useRoute()
console.log('Attempted Path:', route.fullPath)
</script>

<style scoped>
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 50vh; /* Consider using viewport height */
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

p {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background-color: #007bff; /* Example:  Use your brand color */
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3; /* Example:  A slightly darker shade */
}
</style>
```

**Important:** Remember to adjust the import path for `SiteSearch` to match the actual location of your component file.
