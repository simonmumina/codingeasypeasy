# Mastering Conditional Styles in Chakra UI: Dynamic Themes and Responsive Design

Chakra UI is a popular React component library that provides a comprehensive set of UI primitives and tools for building accessible and reusable web applications. One of the most powerful features of Chakra UI is its ability to handle conditional styling effortlessly. This allows you to create UIs that adapt to different scenarios, such as screen sizes, user interactions, and application states, leading to a more engaging and user-friendly experience. This blog post will delve into the intricacies of conditional styles in Chakra UI, providing practical examples and best practices for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

## What are Conditional Styles?

Conditional styles are styles that are applied to a component only when certain conditions are met. These conditions can be based on:

- **Screen Size (Responsive Design):** Applying different styles based on the device's screen size (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **User Interaction (Hover, Focus, Active):** Changing styles based on user interactions like hovering over a button or focusing on an input field.
- **Application State:** Modifying styles based on the application's internal state, such as a loading indicator or an error message.
- **Theme:** Changing the look and feel of the UI based on the selected theme (e.g., light mode, dark mode).

Chakra UI provides several mechanisms for implementing conditional styles, making it a breeze to create dynamic and adaptable UIs.

## Methods for Implementing Conditional Styles in Chakra UI

Here are the primary methods for adding conditional styling in Chakra UI.

### 1. Using the `sx` Prop

The `sx` prop is the most common and versatile way to apply styles in Chakra UI. It accepts a style object that can include CSS properties and pseudo-selectors, enabling you to define conditional styles based on media queries and other conditions. It also supports theme-aware values.

**Example: Responsive Styling with `sx`**

```plaintext
import { Box, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function ResponsiveText() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Text
        sx={{
          fontSize: ['sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl'], // Array of font sizes for different screen sizes
          color: 'blue.500',
          _hover: {
            color: 'red.500', // Style on hover
          },
        }}
      >
        This text is responsive!
      </Text>
    </Box>
  );
}

export default ResponsiveText;
```

In this example:

- The `fontSize` property is an array. Chakra UI automatically maps these values to the following breakpoints: `base`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. So `sm` applies to mobile, `md` to tablets, and so on.
- The `_hover` pseudo-selector defines the style to apply when the user hovers over the text.

**Example: Theme-Aware Styling with `sx`**

```plaintext
import { Box, Text, useColorMode } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function ThemedText() {
  const { colorMode } = useColorMode();

  return (
    <Box>
      <Text
        sx={{
          color: colorMode === 'light' ? 'gray.800' : 'gray.200',
          bg: colorMode === 'light' ? 'gray.100' : 'gray.700',
          padding: 4,
          borderRadius: 'md',
        }}
      >
        This text changes with the theme!
      </Text>
    </Box>
  );
}

export default ThemedText;
```

This example shows how to change the text and background color based on the current color mode (light or dark). The `useColorMode` hook provides access to the current color mode.

### 2. Using Style Props (Shorthand)

Chakra UI also provides shorthand style props that correspond to CSS properties. You can use these props to apply styles directly to components, making your code more concise. These shorthand props also accept responsive arrays.

**Example: Responsive Styling with Style Props**

```plaintext
import { Box, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function ResponsiveBox() {
  return (
    <Box
      width={['100%', '75%', '50%']} // Responsive width
      p={4} // Padding
      bg="gray.100"
    >
      <Text>This box is responsive too!</Text>
    </Box>
  );
}

export default ResponsiveBox;
```

In this example, the `width` prop accepts an array of values, similar to the `sx` prop. The same breakpoint mapping applies.

### 3. Using the `useBreakpointValue` Hook

The `useBreakpointValue` hook provides a more explicit way to access breakpoint-specific values. It's particularly useful when you need to use breakpoint values outside of the `sx` prop or style props.

**Example: Using `useBreakpointValue` for Conditional Rendering**

```plaintext
import { Box, Text, useBreakpointValue } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function ResponsiveComponent() {
  const isMobile = useBreakpointValue({ base: true, md: false });

  return (
    <Box>
      {isMobile ? (
        <Text>This is visible on mobile.</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>This is visible on larger screens.</Text>
      )}
    </Box>
  );
}

export default ResponsiveComponent;
```

In this example, the `useBreakpointValue` hook returns `true` if the current screen size is `base` (mobile) and `false` otherwise. This allows you to conditionally render different content based on the screen size.

### 4. Styled Components with Theme Provider

You can use styled components to define custom components with conditional styles. This gives you a lot of flexibility and is great for creating reusable component variations.

```plaintext
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import { Box, Text, useColorMode } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const StyledBox = styled(Box)`
  background-color: ${({ theme, colorMode }) =>
    colorMode === 'light' ? theme.colors.gray[100] : theme.colors.gray[700]};
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
`;

function CustomComponent() {
  const { colorMode } = useColorMode();

  return (
    <StyledBox colorMode={colorMode}>
      <Text>This is a custom styled component.</Text>
    </StyledBox>
  );
}

export default CustomComponent;
```

In this example:

- We're using `@emotion/styled` which is a common approach for styled components. While Chakra UI also uses Emotion internally, directly using styled components can offer finer control.
- The `StyledBox` component is defined using styled components, and it receives the `theme` and `colorMode` as props.
- The background color is dynamically determined based on the `colorMode`.

### 5. Custom Variants

Chakra UI allows you to define custom variants for components, which can be used to apply different styles based on a component's `variant` prop. This is excellent for creating reusable component styles.

```plaintext
import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const variants = {
  'with-shadow': {
    bg: 'red.400',
    boxShadow: '0 0 2px 2px #efdfde',
  },
  ghost: {
    color: 'blue.500',
  },
};

const sizes = {
  md: {
    fontSize: 'md',
    px: 6, // <-- these values are tokens from the design system
    py: 4, // <-- these values are tokens from the design system
  },
};

const theme = {
  components: {
    Button: {
      variants,
      sizes
    },
  },
}

function MyButton() {
    return (
        <>
        <Button variant="with-shadow">With Shadow</Button>
        <Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
        <Button size="md">Normal</Button>
        </>
    )
}

export default MyButton
```

**Explanation:**

- The `variants` object defines two custom variants: `with-shadow` and `ghost`. Each variant specifies a set of styles to apply.
- The `theme` object extends the default Chakra UI theme with the custom variants. To use this, you'd wrap your application in a `ChakraProvider` and pass this theme to it.
- The `MyButton` component renders three buttons, each with a different variant.
- The size is defined for md which is px and py, and the fontSize

## Best Practices for Conditional Styles in Chakra UI

- **Use the `sx` prop or shorthand style props for simple conditional styling.** They provide a concise and readable way to apply styles based on various conditions.
- **Use the `useBreakpointValue` hook for more complex conditional logic.** When you need to access breakpoint-specific values outside of the styling context, this hook is invaluable.
- **Define custom variants for reusable component styles.** This promotes consistency and maintainability throughout your application.
- **Leverage theme-aware styles for consistent look and feel.** Use the `useColorMode` hook and the theme object to ensure that your styles adapt to the selected theme.
- **Keep your style objects organized and readable.** Use comments to explain the purpose of each style rule and break down complex styles into smaller, more manageable chunks.
- **Test your conditional styles thoroughly.** Make sure your UI adapts correctly to different screen sizes, user interactions, and application states.

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for conditional styling in Chakra UI:

- **Responsive navigation menus:** Display a hamburger menu on mobile devices and a full navigation bar on larger screens.
- **Adaptive layouts:** Adjust the layout of your content based on the screen size, such as using a grid layout on desktop and a stacked layout on mobile.
- **Interactive form elements:** Change the appearance of form elements when they are focused or invalid.
- **Dynamic loading indicators:** Show a loading indicator while data is being fetched from the server.
- **Error messages:** Display error messages when there are issues with user input or server responses.
- **Theme switching:** Allow users to switch between light and dark modes, changing the overall look and feel of the application.
