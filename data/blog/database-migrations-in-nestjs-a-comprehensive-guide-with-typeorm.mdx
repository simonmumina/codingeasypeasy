# Database Migrations in NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide with TypeORM

Database migrations are an essential part of modern software development. They provide a structured and controlled way to evolve your database schema as your application grows and requirements change. In this guide, we'll explore how to handle database migrations effectively within a NestJS application using TypeORM, a popular and powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for TypeScript and JavaScript.

## What are Database Migrations?

Imagine building a house. Initially, you have a blueprint. But as you build, you might need to adjust the design â€“ add a room, move a wall, or change the wiring. Database migrations are like those adjustments to your database schema.  They are a set of SQL scripts (or programmatic changes) that describe how to transform your database from one version to another. This allows you to:

*   **Track Changes:** Keep a history of all database schema changes.
*   **Version Control:** Easily roll back to previous database states if needed.
*   **Collaboration:**  Enable teams to work on database changes without conflicts.
*   **Reproducibility:** Guarantee that your database schema is consistent across different environments (development, staging, production).

## Why Use Migrations in NestJS?

NestJS, with its modular architecture and strong TypeScript integration, is a perfect framework for building robust and scalable applications. When combined with TypeORM, migrations become a natural extension of your development workflow, offering:

*   **Declarative Approach:** Define your database schema using TypeScript entities, and let TypeORM generate the necessary SQL for migrations.
*   **Type Safety:**  Leverage TypeScript's type system to prevent errors during migration development.
*   **Seamless Integration:** TypeORM is deeply integrated with NestJS, making it easy to configure and use migrations within your application.

## Setting Up Migrations in Your NestJS Project

Let's walk through the steps to set up migrations in a new or existing NestJS project.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm or yarn installed.
*   A NestJS project created (using `nest new project-name`).
*   TypeORM installed and configured (refer to the official TypeORM documentation).
*   A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) configured for your project.

**1. Install TypeORM CLI:**

The TypeORM CLI provides commands for generating and running migrations.

```bash
npm install -g typeorm
# or
yarn global add typeorm
```

**2. Configure TypeORM in `ormconfig.ts` or `ormconfig.js` (or in `app.module.ts`):**

Create a file named `ormconfig.ts` (or `ormconfig.js` for JavaScript projects) in the root of your project.  This file configures TypeORM to connect to your database and manage migrations.

```typescript
// ormconfig.ts
import { DataSourceOptions } from 'typeorm';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config(); // Load environment variables from .env file

const config: DataSourceOptions = {
  type: 'postgres', // Or 'mysql', 'sqlite', etc.
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || '5432', 10),
  username: process.env.DB_USERNAME || 'postgres',
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'password',
  database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'my_database',
  synchronize: false, // Never use `true` in production!
  logging: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development', // Log SQL queries in development
  entities: ['dist/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'], // Path to your entity files
  migrations: ['dist/migrations/*{.ts,.js}'], // Path to your migration files
  subscribers: ['dist/**/*.subscriber{.ts,.js}'],
  cli: {
    entitiesDir: 'src',
    migrationsDir: 'src/migrations',
    subscribersDir: 'src/subscriber',
  },
};

export default config;
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **`.env` file:** Store your database credentials in a `.env` file for security.  Install `dotenv`: `npm install dotenv` or `yarn add dotenv`.  Example `.env` file:

    ```
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USERNAME=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
    DB_NAME=mydatabase
    ```

*   **`synchronize: false`**:  **Never** use `synchronize: true` in production.  It automatically synchronizes your database schema with your entities, which can lead to data loss if you make changes to your entities without creating migrations.

*   **Paths:**  Adjust the `entities`, `migrations`, and `subscribers` paths to match your project structure.  The paths here assume you are compiling your TypeScript code to the `dist` directory.

*   **Logging:** Enable logging in development to see the SQL queries generated by TypeORM.

**Alternatively, configure TypeORM in `app.module.ts`:**

You can also configure TypeORM directly within your `app.module.ts` file.  This approach is suitable for simpler configurations or when you prefer a more centralized approach.

```typescript
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { ConfigModule, ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config'; // Import ConfigModule

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      isGlobal: true, // Make ConfigModule globally available
    }),
    TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
      imports: [ConfigModule],
      inject: [ConfigService],
      useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
        type: 'postgres', // Or 'mysql', 'sqlite', etc.
        host: configService.get<string>('DB_HOST') || 'localhost',
        port: parseInt(configService.get<string>('DB_PORT') || '5432', 10),
        username: configService.get<string>('DB_USERNAME') || 'postgres',
        password: configService.get<string>('DB_PASSWORD') || 'password',
        database: configService.get<string>('DB_NAME') || 'my_database',
        synchronize: false,
        logging: configService.get<string>('NODE_ENV') === 'development',
        entities: [__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],
        migrations: [__dirname + '/migrations/*{.ts,.js}'],
        subscribers: [__dirname + '/**/*.subscriber{.ts,.js}'],
      }),
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, we are using the `@nestjs/config` package to load configuration values from environment variables. Make sure to install `@nestjs/config`: `npm install @nestjs/config` or `yarn add @nestjs/config`.  Also, adjust the paths as needed.

**3. Create Your First Entity:**

Entities represent your database tables. Let's create a simple `User` entity:

```typescript
// src/user/user.entity.ts
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  firstName: string;

  @Column()
  lastName: string;

  @Column({ default: true })
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

**4. Generate a Migration:**

Now, let's generate a migration based on the changes to your entities (in this case, creating the `User` table).

```bash
typeorm migration:generate ./src/migrations/CreateUserTable -d ./ormconfig.ts
# or (if using the command directly and not through a script)
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:generate ./src/migrations/CreateUserTable -d ./ormconfig.ts
```

This command will create a new TypeScript file in the `src/migrations` directory (or your configured migrations directory).  The filename will be timestamped and include the migration name you provided (`CreateUserTable`).

**5. Examine the Generated Migration:**

Open the generated migration file.  It will contain `up` and `down` methods. The `up` method defines the changes to apply to the database (e.g., creating a table), and the `down` method defines how to revert those changes (e.g., dropping the table).  TypeORM automatically generates the SQL based on your entity definition.

```typescript
// src/migrations/1677654321000-CreateUserTable.ts (example)
import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from 'typeorm';

export class CreateUserTable1677654321000 implements MigrationInterface {
  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(
      `CREATE TABLE "user" ("id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, "firstName" character varying NOT NULL, "lastName" character varying NOT NULL, "isActive" boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true)`
    );
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE "user"`);
  }
}
```

**6. Run the Migrations:**

To apply the migrations to your database, run the following command:

```bash
typeorm migration:run -d ./ormconfig.ts
# or (if using the command directly and not through a script)
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run -d ./ormconfig.ts
```

This command will execute all pending migrations in order.

**7. Revert Migrations (if needed):**

If you need to undo the last migration, run:

```bash
typeorm migration:revert -d ./ormconfig.ts
# or (if using the command directly and not through a script)
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:revert -d ./ormconfig.ts
```

This will execute the `down` method of the last applied migration. You can revert multiple migrations by running this command multiple times.

## Best Practices for Database Migrations

*   **Keep Migrations Small and Focused:**  Each migration should address a specific change to your database schema.  Avoid making large, complex migrations that are difficult to understand and debug.
*   **Test Your Migrations:**  Before applying migrations to your production environment, test them thoroughly in a development or staging environment. This will help you catch any errors or unexpected behavior.
*   **Use Meaningful Migration Names:**  Choose descriptive names for your migrations that clearly indicate the purpose of the changes.  This will make it easier to track and manage your migrations over time.
*   **Version Control Your Migrations:**  Store your migration files in your version control system (e.g., Git) along with your application code. This ensures that you have a complete history of your database schema and can easily roll back to previous versions if needed.
*   **Automate Migration Deployment:**  Integrate your database migrations into your deployment pipeline. This will ensure that your database schema is always up-to-date when you deploy new versions of your application.  Tools like Flyway or Liquibase can also be integrated for managing migrations.
*   **Handle Data Migrations:**  Sometimes, schema changes require data transformations.  Include these transformations within your migration scripts. Be very careful when modifying data, and always back up your database before running migrations that modify data. Consider using seed data for initial data population.

## Example: Adding a New Column to the User Entity

Let's say we want to add an `email` column to the `User` entity.

**1. Update the Entity:**

```typescript
// src/user/user.entity.ts
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  firstName: string;

  @Column()
  lastName: string;

  @Column({ default: true })
  isActive: boolean;

  @Column({ nullable: true }) // Make the column nullable initially
  email: string;
}
```

**2. Generate the Migration:**

```bash
typeorm migration:generate ./src/migrations/AddEmailToUserTable -d ./ormconfig.ts
# or (if using the command directly and not through a script)
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:generate ./src/migrations/AddEmailToUserTable -d ./ormconfig.ts
```

**3. Examine and Customize the Migration (if needed):**

TypeORM will likely generate a migration to add the `email` column. You might want to customize the migration to handle existing data or set a default value.

```typescript
// src/migrations/1677654321001-AddEmailToUserTable.ts (example)
import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from 'typeorm';

export class AddEmailToUserTable1677654321001 implements MigrationInterface {
  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(
      `ALTER TABLE "user" ADD COLUMN "email" character varying`
    );
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN "email"`);
  }
}
```

**4. Run the Migration:**

```bash
typeorm migration:run -d ./ormconfig.ts
# or (if using the command directly and not through a script)
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run -d ./ormconfig.ts
```

After running the migration, the `email` column will be added to the `user` table.

## Seeding Your Database

Often, you'll want to populate your database with initial data, especially for development and testing environments.  TypeORM doesn't directly provide a built-in seeding mechanism, but you can easily implement one using a migration or a separate script.

**1. Create a Seeding Script (e.g., `src/database/seeds/user.seed.ts`):**

```typescript
// src/database/seeds/user.seed.ts
import { DataSource } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from '../../user/user.entity'; // Adjust path as needed
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

async function seedUsers(dataSource: DataSource): Promise<void> {
  const userRepository = dataSource.getRepository(User);

  const users = [
    { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
    { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Smith', email: 'jane.smith@example.com' },
  ];

  for (const userData of users) {
    const user = userRepository.create(userData);
    await userRepository.save(user);
  }

  console.log('User seeding completed.');
}

export default seedUsers;
```

**2. Create a Migration to Run the Seeder:**

```typescript
// src/migrations/1677654321002-SeedUsers.ts (example)
import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from 'typeorm';
import { DataSource } from 'typeorm';
import seedUsers from '../database/seeds/user.seed';  // Adjust path as needed
import config from '../../ormconfig'; // Adjust path as needed

export class SeedUsers1677654321002 implements MigrationInterface {
    public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
        const dataSource = new DataSource(config); // Create a new DataSource instance
        await dataSource.initialize();
        await seedUsers(dataSource); // Call the seed function
        await dataSource.destroy(); // Close the connection after seeding
    }

    public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
      // You can optionally implement a 'down' method to remove the seeded data.
      // For example, you could delete all users created during the seeding process.
      // This is generally not necessary for development/testing environments.
    }
}
```

**3. Run the Migration:**

```bash
typeorm migration:run -d ./ormconfig.ts
# or (if using the command directly and not through a script)
ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run -d ./ormconfig.ts
```

**Important Considerations for Seeding:**

*   **Environment-Specific Seeding:**  You might want to only run seeders in development or testing environments.  Use environment variables to control whether the seeder is executed.
*   **Data Dependencies:** If your seed data has dependencies on other entities, make sure to seed those entities first.
*   **Down Method:**  Consider implementing a `down` method in your seeding migration to remove the seeded data. This is useful for resetting your database during testing.
*   **Alternatives:** Libraries like `typeorm-seeding` provide more advanced seeding capabilities.

## Common Issues and Solutions

*   **`Cannot connect to the database`:**  Double-check your database credentials in your `.env` file and ensure your database server is running. Verify the `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, and `database` are correct.

*   **`Migration X has already been run`:**  TypeORM tracks which migrations have been applied in the `migrations` table in your database. If you accidentally re-run a migration, you might encounter this error. You can try reverting the migration first using `typeorm migration:revert` before running `typeorm migration:run` again.

*   **`Entity not found`:**  Ensure the paths to your entity files in `ormconfig.ts` (or in your `app.module.ts` TypeOrmModule configuration) are correct.  Remember to compile your TypeScript code before running migrations if you're pointing to the `dist` directory.

*   **`Error during migration execution`:**  Carefully examine the error message for details about the cause of the error.  It could be a syntax error in your SQL, a data type mismatch, or a constraint violation. Check your migration code and your entity definitions.

*   **Conflicting Migrations:**  When working in a team, different developers might generate migrations that conflict with each other (e.g., both trying to modify the same table).  Coordinate with your team to avoid conflicts and ensure that migrations are applied in the correct order. Resolve conflicts by either rebasing or merging your branches carefully, paying close attention to the migration files.
