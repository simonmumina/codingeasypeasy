# How to Change DNS Server via CMD (netsh) on Windows: A Comprehensive Guide

Changing your DNS (Domain Name System) server can be a quick and effective way to improve your internet speed, enhance security, and bypass certain website restrictions. While you can manually change your DNS settings through the Windows graphical interface, using the Command Prompt (CMD) offers a faster and more efficient method, especially when you need to make these changes frequently or on multiple computers.

This guide will walk you through the process of changing your DNS server using the `netsh` (Network Shell) command in Windows CMD. We'll cover the basic command structure, common DNS server addresses, and how to verify your changes.

## Why Change Your DNS Server?

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand why you might want to change your DNS server:

*   **Improved Speed:** Some DNS servers are faster than others. Switching to a faster DNS server can reduce the time it takes to load websites and improve your overall internet browsing experience.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Certain DNS servers offer built-in security features, such as malware blocking and phishing protection.
*   **Bypass Restrictions:** Some DNS servers can bypass censorship or geographical restrictions, allowing you to access content that might otherwise be unavailable.
*   **Reliability:** If your ISP's DNS servers are unreliable, switching to a more stable alternative can prevent intermittent connectivity issues.

## Prerequisites

*   **Administrator Privileges:**  You'll need to run CMD as an administrator to make changes to your network configuration.
*   **Basic Understanding of Networking:** Familiarity with concepts like IP addresses and DNS servers will be helpful, but not strictly necessary.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Changing DNS with `netsh`

Here's the step-by-step process for changing your DNS server using the `netsh` command in CMD:

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**

    *   Press the Windows key, type "cmd," right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator."
    *   A User Account Control (UAC) prompt will appear. Click "Yes" to grant administrator privileges.

2.  **Identify Your Network Adapter Name:**

    Before changing the DNS server, you need to know the name of the network adapter you're using (e.g., "Ethernet," "Wi-Fi"). You can find this using the `ipconfig /all` command.

    ```cmd
    ipconfig /all
    ```

    Look for the section corresponding to your active network connection.  Under that section, locate the "Description" field. The value listed there (e.g., "Ethernet" or "Wireless Network Connection") is the name of your network adapter. **Note this name down, as you'll need it in the next step.** It's crucial to use the correct name for the command to work.

3.  **Set the Preferred DNS Server:**

    Use the following command to set the preferred DNS server.  Replace `"Ethernet"` with the actual name of your network adapter from the previous step.  Also, replace `8.8.8.8` with the desired DNS server address.  `8.8.8.8` is Google's public DNS server.

    ```cmd
    netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet" static 8.8.8.8 primary
    ```

    *   `netsh`:  The Network Shell command-line utility.
    *   `interface ip`:  Specifies that you're configuring the IP settings of an interface.
    *   `set dns`: Indicates that you're modifying the DNS settings.
    *   `name="Ethernet"`:  Specifies the name of the network adapter.  **Replace "Ethernet" with your actual adapter name.**
    *   `static`: Indicates that you're setting a static DNS server address (as opposed to obtaining it automatically from a DHCP server).
    *   `8.8.8.8`: The IP address of the preferred DNS server.
    *   `primary`: Specifies this is the primary DNS server. While `primary` isn't technically a mandatory argument with `static`, it's good practice to include it for clarity.

4.  **Set the Alternate DNS Server (Optional):**

    It's recommended to set an alternate DNS server as a backup in case the primary server is unavailable. Use the following command, replacing `"Ethernet"` with your network adapter name and `8.8.4.4` with the alternate DNS server address (again, `8.8.4.4` is a Google public DNS server):

    ```cmd
    netsh interface ip add dns name="Ethernet" address=8.8.4.4 index=2
    ```

    *   `add dns`:  Used to add a DNS server to the existing list.
    *   `address=8.8.4.4`: The IP address of the alternate DNS server.
    *   `index=2`: Specifies the order of this DNS server in the list. The primary DNS server usually has an index of 1.

5.  **Flush the DNS Resolver Cache:**

    After changing the DNS settings, it's crucial to flush the DNS resolver cache on your computer. This clears any cached DNS records and forces your computer to query the new DNS servers.

    ```cmd
    ipconfig /flushdns
    ```

    This command should complete quickly and return a confirmation message.

6.  **Verify the DNS Server Changes:**

    You can verify that the DNS server has been changed by using the `ipconfig /all` command again.

    ```cmd
    ipconfig /all
    ```

    Look for the section corresponding to your network adapter.  The "DNS Servers" field should now list the DNS server addresses you set in steps 3 and 4.

## Common DNS Server Addresses

Here are some popular and reliable DNS server addresses:

*   **Google Public DNS:**
    *   Preferred DNS server: `8.8.8.8`
    *   Alternate DNS server: `8.8.4.4`
*   **Cloudflare DNS:**
    *   Preferred DNS server: `1.1.1.1`
    *   Alternate DNS server: `1.0.0.1`
*   **Quad9:**
    *   Preferred DNS server: `9.9.9.9`
    *   Alternate DNS server: `149.112.112.112`

Choose a DNS server that best suits your needs based on factors like speed, security, and privacy.

## Resetting to Default DNS Settings (DHCP)

If you want to revert to using the DNS servers assigned by your ISP via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), use the following command:

```cmd
netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet" source=dhcp
```

Replace `"Ethernet"` with the actual name of your network adapter.  This will instruct your computer to automatically obtain DNS server addresses from the network.  Don't forget to `ipconfig /flushdns` after resetting to DHCP.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"The requested operation requires elevation."** - Make sure you are running CMD as an administrator.
*   **"An error occurred while setting the DNS server address."** - Double-check that you have the correct network adapter name. Ensure there are no typos in the command.
*   **Internet connection not working after changing DNS:**  Verify that you have entered the DNS server addresses correctly. Try using a different set of public DNS servers (e.g., Google or Cloudflare).  Also, ensure your network connection is working correctly (e.g., check your router).
*   **Changes not reflected:** Flush the DNS resolver cache using `ipconfig /flushdns`.  Restarting your computer can also help.
*   **Multiple DNS servers listed when you only set two:**  Sometimes, Windows may retain old DNS server addresses. To clear these completely, you can use the following command to remove all DNS servers and then add the desired ones:

    ```cmd
    netsh interface ip delete dns name="Ethernet" all
    netsh interface ip set dns name="Ethernet" static 8.8.8.8 primary
    netsh interface ip add dns name="Ethernet" address=8.8.4.4 index=2
    ```

## Conclusion

Changing your DNS server via CMD using the `netsh` command is a powerful way to optimize your network settings. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can quickly and easily improve your internet speed, enhance security, and bypass restrictions. Remember to always double-check your commands and verify your changes to ensure everything is working correctly. Happy browsing!
