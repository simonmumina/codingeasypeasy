# Material UI Button Group: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Material UI (MUI) offers a rich set of pre-built, customizable React components designed to accelerate your frontend development.  Among these, the `ButtonGroup` component stands out as a versatile tool for grouping related buttons together, providing a cleaner and more intuitive user interface. This guide will explore the `ButtonGroup` component in detail, covering its core functionalities, customization options, and practical use cases with clear, concise code examples.

## What is the Material UI ButtonGroup?

The `ButtonGroup` component in Material UI is a container for grouping a set of `Button` components.  It provides a consistent look and feel, ensuring that the buttons are visually connected and act as a cohesive unit. This is particularly useful for scenarios where users need to select from a limited set of mutually exclusive or related options.

## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have Material UI installed in your React project. If not, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

or

```bash
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## Basic Usage

Let's begin with a simple example of how to create a basic `ButtonGroup` with three buttons:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import ButtonGroup from '@mui/material/ButtonGroup';

function BasicButtonGroup() {
  return (
    <ButtonGroup variant="contained" aria-label="outlined primary button group">
      <Button>One</Button>
      <Button>Two</Button>
      <Button>Three</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  );
}

export default BasicButtonGroup;
```

In this code:

*   We import the necessary components: `Button` and `ButtonGroup` from `@mui/material`.
*   We create a functional component `BasicButtonGroup`.
*   We use the `ButtonGroup` component to wrap three `Button` components.
*   The `variant="contained"` prop applies the contained style to the buttons.
*   The `aria-label` prop is crucial for accessibility, providing a descriptive label for screen readers.

## Props and Customization

The `ButtonGroup` component offers several props for customization:

*   **`variant`**:  Determines the appearance of the buttons. Options include `contained`, `outlined`, and `text`. Defaults to `outlined`.
*   **`orientation`**: Specifies the layout direction of the buttons.  Can be either `horizontal` (default) or `vertical`.
*   **`color`**:  Sets the color theme for the buttons.  Options include `primary`, `secondary`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `success`, and `default`.
*   **`size`**:  Controls the size of the buttons. Options include `small`, `medium` (default), and `large`.
*   **`disabled`**:  Disables all buttons within the group.
*   **`disableElevation`**:  Removes the box shadow from the buttons when the variant is `contained`.
*   **`fullWidth`**:  Stretches the button group to fill its container.

Let's explore some examples using these props:

### Vertical Button Group

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import ButtonGroup from '@mui/material/ButtonGroup';

function VerticalButtonGroup() {
  return (
    <ButtonGroup
      orientation="vertical"
      aria-label="vertical contained button group"
      variant="contained"
    >
      <Button>One</Button>
      <Button>Two</Button>
      <Button>Three</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  );
}

export default VerticalButtonGroup;
```

This code snippet creates a `ButtonGroup` where the buttons are arranged vertically using the `orientation="vertical"` prop.

### Button Group with Different Sizes and Colors

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import ButtonGroup from '@mui/material/ButtonGroup';

function SizeAndColorButtonGroup() {
  return (
    <>
      <ButtonGroup size="small" aria-label="small outlined button group">
        <Button>Small</Button>
        <Button>Small</Button>
        <Button>Small</Button>
      </ButtonGroup>
      <br />
      <ButtonGroup color="secondary" aria-label="medium secondary button group">
        <Button>Medium</Button>
        <Button>Medium</Button>
        <Button>Medium</Button>
      </ButtonGroup>
      <br />
      <ButtonGroup size="large" color="primary" aria-label="large outlined primary button group">
        <Button>Large</Button>
        <Button>Large</Button>
        <Button>Large</Button>
      </ButtonGroup>
    </>
  );
}

export default SizeAndColorButtonGroup;
```

Here, we demonstrate how to use the `size` and `color` props to customize the appearance of the `ButtonGroup`. We create three button groups: one small, one medium with a secondary color, and one large with a primary color.

### Button Group with Disabled Buttons

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import ButtonGroup from '@mui/material/ButtonGroup';

function DisabledButtonGroup() {
  return (
    <ButtonGroup disabled aria-label="disabled button group">
      <Button>One</Button>
      <Button>Two</Button>
      <Button>Three</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  );
}

export default DisabledButtonGroup;
```

In this example, the `disabled` prop is set to `true`, disabling all buttons within the group.

### Full Width Button Group

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import ButtonGroup from '@mui/material/ButtonGroup';

function FullWidthButtonGroup() {
  return (
    <ButtonGroup fullWidth variant="contained" aria-label="full width button group">
      <Button>Save</Button>
      <Button>Discard</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  );
}

export default FullWidthButtonGroup;
```

This example uses the `fullWidth` property to make the Button Group fill its container.

## Advanced Usage and Considerations

*   **Accessibility:**  Always provide appropriate `aria-label` attributes to ensure your button groups are accessible to users with disabilities. This helps screen readers interpret the purpose of the button group.
*   **Styling with CSS:**  You can further customize the appearance of the `ButtonGroup` and its buttons using CSS. You can target the components using their class names or by using Material UI's styling solutions, such as `styled-components` or `emotion`.
*   **Conditional Rendering:**  You can conditionally render buttons within the `ButtonGroup` based on application state or user permissions.  This allows you to dynamically adjust the options available to the user.
*   **Integration with Forms:** Button groups can be seamlessly integrated with forms to provide options for selecting values. Consider using radio buttons within the button group for mutually exclusive options.
*   **Combining with Icons:** Enhance the visual appeal and clarity of your buttons by including icons. Material UI provides a rich set of icons that can be easily integrated.

## Example: Button Group with Icons

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import ButtonGroup from '@mui/material/ButtonGroup';
import SaveIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Save';
import DeleteIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Delete';

function ButtonGroupWithIcons() {
  return (
    <ButtonGroup variant="contained" aria-label="contained primary button group">
      <Button startIcon={<SaveIcon />}>Save</Button>
      <Button startIcon={<DeleteIcon />}>Delete</Button>
    </ButtonGroup>
  );
}

export default ButtonGroupWithIcons;
```

In this example, we import `SaveIcon` and `DeleteIcon` from `@mui/icons-material` and use them as the `startIcon` for the `Save` and `Delete` buttons, respectively.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Button Groups for Related Actions:**  Group buttons that perform related actions or represent mutually exclusive choices.
*   **Keep the Number of Buttons Manageable:** Avoid overcrowding the button group with too many buttons. If you have a large number of options, consider using a dropdown menu or other selection component.
*   **Provide Clear Labels:**  Use concise and descriptive labels for each button to ensure users understand their purpose.
*   **Prioritize Accessibility:**  Always include `aria-label` attributes and ensure that the button group is keyboard accessible.
*   **Maintain Visual Consistency:**  Use consistent styling and spacing for all button groups in your application.
