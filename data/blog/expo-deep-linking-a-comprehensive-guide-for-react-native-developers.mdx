# Expo Deep Linking: A Comprehensive Guide for React Native Developers

Deep linking is a crucial feature for any modern mobile application. It allows users to navigate directly to specific content within your app from external sources like websites, emails, or push notifications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve deep into Expo deep linking for React Native, covering everything from basic URI schemes to advanced universal links, ensuring your users have a seamless and intuitive experience.

## What is Deep Linking?

Deep linking is the process of using a uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme or universal link to navigate a user directly to a specific location within a mobile application. Instead of just opening the app, a deep link can take the user to a particular screen, pre-fill a form, or even trigger a specific action within the app.

**Benefits of Deep Linking:**

- **Improved User Experience:** Direct users to relevant content quickly and easily.
- **Enhanced App Engagement:** Increase user interaction with targeted campaigns and promotions.
- **Better Conversion Rates:** Simplify the user journey by linking directly to purchase flows or sign-up forms.
- **Seamless User Onboarding:** Guide new users through specific app features.
- **Simplified Social Sharing:** Enable easy sharing of content with deep links that open directly within the app.

## Deep Linking in Expo: Two Main Approaches

Expo offers two primary methods for implementing deep linking in your React Native applications:

1.  **URI Schemes (Custom URL Schemes):** These are custom protocols that you define for your app (e.g., `myapp://`). They work on both iOS and Android but require users to have the app installed.
2.  **Universal Links (App Links on Android):** These links use standard HTTP(S) URLs (e.g., `https://myapp.com/path`) and are the preferred approach. They offer a more seamless experience as they don't rely on custom schemes and can handle cases where the app isn't installed (falling back to a web page).

## 1. Implementing URI Schemes (Custom URL Schemes)

**Step 1: Configure your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`)**

In your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file, add the `scheme` property. This defines the URI scheme that your app will listen for.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "slug": "myapp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scheme": "myapp", // <---- This is the key part
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.myapp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Uniqueness:** Choose a unique scheme to avoid conflicts with other apps.
- **Build:** After modifying `app.json`, you'll need to rebuild your native binaries using `expo prebuild`.
- **Testing:** Test your URI scheme thoroughly on both iOS and Android.

**Step 2: Handle the Deep Link in Your App**

Use the `Linking` API from React Native to listen for incoming URLs.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, Linking, Button } from 'react-native'

const HomeScreen = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleUrl = (event) => {
      setUrl(event.url)
      // Process the URL and navigate accordingly
      console.log('Incoming URL:', event.url)
      // Example:  Navigate based on the path
      if (event.url.includes('profile')) {
        // Navigate to the profile screen
        console.log('Navigating to Profile Screen')
      } else if (event.url.includes('product')) {
        // Navigate to the product screen
        console.log('Navigating to Product Screen')
      }
    }

    const getInitialUrl = async () => {
      const initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURL()
      if (initialUrl) {
        setUrl(initialUrl)
        console.log('Initial URL:', initialUrl)
      }
    }

    Linking.addEventListener('url', handleUrl)
    getInitialUrl()

    return () => {
      Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleUrl)
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Text>Deep Link URL: {url ? url : 'No URL'}</Text>
      <Button
        title="Open Profile (myapp://profile)"
        onPress={() => Linking.openURL('myapp://profile')}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

export default HomeScreen
```

**Explanation:**

- **`Linking.getInitialURL()`:** This function retrieves the URL that launched the app (if any). It's crucial for handling deep links when the app is opened from a closed state.
- **`Linking.addEventListener('url', handleUrl)`:** This registers a listener for incoming URLs. The `handleUrl` function is called whenever the app receives a URL.
- **`Linking.openURL(url)`:** This function opens a URL. In this example, we're using it to trigger a deep link manually for testing purposes.
- **Processing the URL:** Within the `handleUrl` function, you'll need to parse the URL and extract the relevant information (e.g., path, query parameters) to determine the appropriate action. We've provided a basic example using `includes`, but you might want to use a more robust URL parsing library for complex URLs.

**Step 3: Testing the URI Scheme**

**iOS:**

- You can use the `xcrun simctl openurl booted myapp://` command in your terminal (replace `myapp://` with your actual URL). Make sure you have the iOS simulator running.
- Alternatively, you can create an HTML link and open it in Safari on the simulator.

**Android:**

- Use the `adb shell am start -W -d "myapp://profile" com.example.myapp` command in your terminal (replace `myapp://profile` and `com.example.myapp` with your actual URL and package name). Ensure you have the Android emulator or a connected device.

**Important Considerations for URI Schemes:**

- **Security:** Be cautious when handling data from deep links, as they can be manipulated. Sanitize and validate all input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Conflict Resolution:** The operating system might ask the user which app they want to open if multiple apps register for the same URI scheme.
- **Reliability:** URI schemes are less reliable than Universal Links, especially on Android.
- **Not always SEO friendly:** Because they are custom, they don't play well with search engines for indexing and crawling purposes.

## 2. Implementing Universal Links (App Links on Android)

Universal Links are the preferred approach for deep linking as they offer a more secure and seamless experience. They use standard HTTP(S) URLs, which means they can fall back to a web page if the app is not installed.

**Step 1: Associate Your App with Your Website**

This is the most crucial step. You need to prove to the operating system that you own both the app and the website.

**iOS:**

1.  **Create an `apple-app-site-association` file:** This file contains JSON that associates your app's bundle identifier with your website. It should be placed at the root of your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/apple-app-site-association`) or in the `.well-known` subdirectory (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`).

    ```json
    {
      "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
          {
            "appID": "YOUR_TEAM_ID.com.example.myapp",
            "paths": ["*", "/profile/*", "/product/*"] // Adjust paths to match your app's routing
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    - **`YOUR_TEAM_ID`:** Your Apple Developer Team ID.
    - **`com.example.myapp`:** Your app's bundle identifier (from your `app.json`).
    - **`paths`:** An array of URL paths that your app should handle. `"*"` matches all paths. Be as specific as possible for better security.

2.  **Upload the file to your server:** Ensure the file is served with the correct MIME type (`application/json`) and is accessible via HTTPS.

3.  **Enable Associated Domains in Xcode:** In your Xcode project, go to your target settings, then the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. Add the "Associated Domains" capability and add your domain with the `applinks:` prefix (e.g., `applinks:yourdomain.com`). **This step is often the source of errors. Make sure the prefix is correct, and the domain is correct.** This also needs to be properly configured on the Apple Developer Portal for your app ID.

**Android:**

1.  **Create a `assetlinks.json` file:** Similar to the iOS `apple-app-site-association` file, this file associates your app's package name and SHA256 fingerprints with your website. Place this file at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.

    ```json
    [
      {
        "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
        "target": {
          "namespace": "android_app",
          "package_name": "com.example.myapp", // Your Android package name
          "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
            "YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT" // Replace with your app's SHA256 fingerprint(s)
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    - **`com.example.myapp`:** Your app's package name (from your `app.json`).
    - **`YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT`:** The SHA256 fingerprint(s) of your app's signing certificate. You can obtain this using the `keytool` command:

      ```plaintext
      keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-alias
      ```

      (Replace `my-release-key.keystore` and `my-alias` with your actual keystore file and alias). You'll need to do this for both your debug and release builds. **This is a common point of failure; make sure you're using the correct fingerprint for the build you're testing with.**

2.  **Upload the file to your server:** Ensure the file is served with the correct MIME type (`application/json`) and is accessible via HTTPS.

3.  **Configure `android:autoVerify="true"` in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:** This tells Android to automatically verify your app links. Expo manages this for you after prebuilding.

    _If you are using EAS build and configured your `android` block correctly, you do NOT need to manually alter your `AndroidManifest.xml`._ Expo handles the auto-verification when you do `expo prebuild`.

    ```xml
    <activity
        android:name=".MainActivity"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenSize|screenLayout|uiMode"
        android:launchMode="singleTask"
        android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"
        android:exported="true">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
        </intent-filter>
        <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">  <-- This line is important! -->
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
            <data android:scheme="http" android:host="yourdomain.com" />
            <data android:scheme="https" android:host="yourdomain.com" />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
    ```

**Key Considerations for Association Files:**

- **HTTPS:** Both the `apple-app-site-association` and `assetlinks.json` files _must_ be served over HTTPS.
- **MIME Type:** Ensure the files are served with the `application/json` MIME type.
- **JSON Validation:** The JSON files must be valid. Use a JSON validator to check for errors.
- **Accessibility:** The files must be publicly accessible. Don't block them with robots.txt or other access restrictions.
- **Cache Control:** Set appropriate cache control headers to ensure the files are updated when you make changes. A good starting point is setting the `Cache-Control` header to `max-age=3600` (one hour).
- **Hosting Provider Configuration:** Some hosting providers might require specific configuration to serve these files correctly. Check your provider's documentation.
- **SHA256 Fingerprint Correctness:** Ensure the fingerprints for the android builds are added correctly. This should be SHA256 from the keystore used to sign the APK. If the app is distributed through Google Play Signing, this needs to be the certificate used by Google to re-sign the APK.

**Step 2: Configure Your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`)**

In your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file, configure the `android.intentFilters` and `ios.associatedDomains` properties.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "slug": "myapp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp",
      "associatedDomains": ["applinks:yourdomain.com"] // <-- Add your domain
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.myapp",
      "intentFilters": [
        {
          "action": "android.intent.action.VIEW",
          "data": [
            {
              "scheme": "http",
              "host": "yourdomain.com",
              "pathPrefix": "/"
            },
            {
              "scheme": "https",
              "host": "yourdomain.com",
              "pathPrefix": "/"
            }
          ],
          "category": ["android.intent.category.DEFAULT", "android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"]
        }
      ]
    },
    "web": {
      "bundler": "metro"
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ios.associatedDomains`:** An array of associated domains with the `applinks:` prefix. This tells iOS to associate your app with these domains.
- **`android.intentFilters`:** An array of intent filters that specify which URLs your app should handle. This is used by Android to determine which app to open when a user clicks on a link. `pathPrefix` tells Android to handle all links that start with the given prefix. `pathPattern` allows for regular expression pattern matching on the path.

**Step 3: Handle the Deep Link in Your App**

The code for handling the deep link in your app is the same as for URI schemes, using the `Linking` API from React Native.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, Linking } from 'react-native'

const HomeScreen = () => {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleUrl = (event) => {
      setUrl(event.url)
      // Process the URL and navigate accordingly
      console.log('Incoming URL:', event.url)
      // Example:  Navigate based on the path
      if (event.url.includes('profile')) {
        // Navigate to the profile screen
        console.log('Navigating to Profile Screen')
      } else if (event.url.includes('product')) {
        // Navigate to the product screen
        console.log('Navigating to Product Screen')
      }
    }

    const getInitialUrl = async () => {
      const initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURL()
      if (initialUrl) {
        setUrl(initialUrl)
        console.log('Initial URL:', initialUrl)
      }
    }

    Linking.addEventListener('url', handleUrl)
    getInitialUrl()

    return () => {
      Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleUrl)
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Text>Deep Link URL: {url ? url : 'No URL'}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default HomeScreen
```

**Step 4: Testing Universal Links**

**iOS:**

- Open a link to your website (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/profile/123`) in Safari on a real device (not the simulator). The device _must_ be physically connected or using TestFlight because iOS doesn't support associated domains on emulators. **This is a common mistake.** The link should open directly in your app. If it opens in Safari, double-check your `apple-app-site-association` file and Xcode configuration.
- You can also test by sending yourself an email with a link to your website.

**Android:**

- Open a link to your website (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/profile/123`) in Chrome on a real device or emulator. The link should open directly in your app. If it opens in Chrome, double-check your `assetlinks.json` file and `AndroidManifest.xml` configuration (managed by Expo).
- Use the `adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://yourdomain.com/profile/123"` command in your terminal.

**Debugging Universal Links:**

- **iOS:** Check the system logs on your device using Xcode's Devices and Simulators window. Look for messages related to `swcd` (Software Update and Content Delivery Daemon), which handles the download and verification of the `apple-app-site-association` file. You might see errors if the file is not correctly configured.
- **Android:** Use `adb logcat` to view the system logs. Look for messages related to "Digital Asset Links" to see if Android is successfully verifying your `assetlinks.json` file.

**Important Considerations for Universal Links:**

- **Correct Configuration:** The most common issue with Universal Links is incorrect configuration of the `apple-app-site-association` and `assetlinks.json` files. Double-check everything carefully.
- **HTTPS:** Your website must be served over HTTPS.
- **User Privacy:** Be mindful of user privacy when handling data from deep links. Clearly explain how you are using the data.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Provide a fallback mechanism for users who don't have your app installed. This could be a relevant web page or a link to the app store.

## Advanced Deep Linking Concepts

- **Deferred Deep Linking:** This allows you to track deep links even if the user doesn't have the app installed. When the user installs the app, they will be taken to the correct destination after the initial launch. This often involves using a third-party deep linking service like Branch, AppsFlyer or Adjust.
- **Branch.io:** Branch provides a free and powerful deep linking service that handles all the complexities of deep linking, including deferred deep linking, attribution, and analytics. Expo has great integration with Branch.
- **Routing Libraries:** Libraries like `react-navigation` or `expo-router` can help you manage your app's navigation stack and handle deep links more effectively.
- **Query Parameters:** Use query parameters in your deep links to pass data to your app (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/product?id=123`).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid or malformed deep links.

## Best Practices for Expo Deep Linking

- **Use Universal Links whenever possible.** They offer a better user experience and are more secure than URI schemes.
- **Validate and sanitize all data from deep links.**
- **Provide a clear and intuitive navigation experience within your app.**
- **Test your deep links thoroughly on both iOS and Android.**
- **Use a deep linking service like Branch for advanced features like deferred deep linking and attribution.**
- **Document your deep linking strategy and implementation.**
- **Use meaningful and descriptive paths in your URLs.** This is better for SEO and user understanding.
- **Keep your `app.json` and associated files up-to-date.**
- **Pay attention to cache control headers on your website.**
- **Use a URL parsing library to handle complex URLs.**
- **Handle different scenarios and edge cases gracefully.**
- **Monitor your deep link performance and usage.**
- **Keep your users informed about how their data is used.**

## Conclusion

Deep linking is a powerful tool that can significantly improve the user experience and engagement of your React Native applications. By following this comprehensive guide, you can implement robust and reliable deep linking using Expo, ensuring your users can seamlessly navigate to the content they need, when they need it. Remember to prioritize Universal Links for a more modern and secure approach, and always test thoroughly across different devices and platforms. Happy deep linking!
