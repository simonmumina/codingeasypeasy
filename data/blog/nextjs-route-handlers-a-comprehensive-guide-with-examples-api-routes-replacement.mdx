# Next.js Route Handlers: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples (API Routes Replacement)

Next.js is constantly evolving, and with the introduction of the `app` directory, we've seen significant improvements in performance, developer experience, and overall architecture. One of the key features introduced with the `app` directory is **Route Handlers**, a powerful alternative to the traditional `pages/api` API Routes.  This guide will dive deep into Route Handlers, covering everything from basic setup to advanced use cases, and provide plenty of code examples along the way.

## What are Next.js Route Handlers?

Route Handlers are functions defined within the `app` directory that handle HTTP requests to specific routes. They allow you to create server-side endpoints directly within your component structure, simplifying the process of building APIs within your Next.js application. Think of them as a modern and more integrated replacement for the older `pages/api` approach.

**Key Advantages of Route Handlers:**

*   **Colocation:** Route Handlers are located within the same directory as your components, making it easier to manage related code and maintain a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Type Safety:**  Built-in support for TypeScript provides type safety and improves developer productivity.
*   **Middleware Integration:** Seamless integration with Next.js Middleware allows you to intercept and modify requests and responses.
*   **Simplified Routing:**  Routing is based on the file system, making it intuitive and easy to understand.
*   **Framework Features:** Access to the full power of Next.js features like Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) and On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (On-Demand ISR).
*   **Streaming:**  Route Handlers support streaming responses for better performance and user experience.
*   **Server Actions Interoperability:** Route Handlers can be called from Server Actions.

## Basic Setup and Usage

Let's start with a simple example.  Suppose you want to create an endpoint at `/api/hello` that returns a JSON response.

1.  **Create the `app/api/hello` directory:**  Inside your `app` directory, create a folder named `api`, and within that, create another folder named `hello`.

2.  **Create the `route.ts` (or `route.js`) file:**  Inside the `app/api/hello` directory, create a file named `route.ts` (or `route.js` if you're not using TypeScript).

3.  **Define your Route Handler:**

```typescript filename="app/api/hello/route.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js Route Handler!' });
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `NextResponse`: This class comes from the `next/server` module and is used to create responses. It provides methods for setting headers, status codes, and body content.  It replaces the older `res.json()` from `pages/api`.
*   `GET`: This function handles GET requests to the `/api/hello` endpoint. The naming is crucial; it dictates which HTTP method the handler responds to. Other methods include `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`, and `HEAD`.
*   `request: Request`: The `request` object provides information about the incoming request, such as headers, query parameters, and body.
*   `NextResponse.json()`: Creates a JSON response with the provided data.

**How to Test:**

Start your Next.js development server (usually `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`).  Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. You should see the JSON response: `{"message": "Hello from Next.js Route Handler!"}`.

## Handling Different HTTP Methods

Route Handlers allow you to handle different HTTP methods by exporting functions with specific names:

*   `GET`: For retrieving data.
*   `POST`: For creating data.
*   `PUT`: For updating existing data.
*   `DELETE`: For deleting data.
*   `PATCH`: For partially updating data.
*   `OPTIONS`: For preflight requests (CORS).
*   `HEAD`:  Similar to GET, but only retrieves headers.

Here's an example of handling both `GET` and `POST` requests:

```typescript filename="app/api/todos/route.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

let todos: Todo[] = [
  { id: 1, text: 'Learn Next.js Route Handlers', completed: true },
  { id: 2, text: 'Build a cool app', completed: false },
];

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return NextResponse.json(todos);
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await request.json(); // Parse the request body
    const newTodo: Todo = {
      id: todos.length + 1, // Basic ID generation
      text: body.text,
      completed: false,
    };
    todos.push(newTodo);
    return NextResponse.json(newTodo, { status: 201 }); // Return the newly created todo with a 201 Created status
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating todo:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to create todo' }, { status: 400 });
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `GET`: Returns the current list of todos.
*   `POST`:  Creates a new todo.  It parses the JSON body of the request using `request.json()`, creates a new `Todo` object, adds it to the `todos` array, and returns the new todo in the response. A 201 Created status code is also returned, indicating a successful creation.  Error handling is included to catch any issues during parsing or processing the request.

**Using the API from a Client Component:**

```typescript filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

export default function Home() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([]);
  const [newTodoText, setNewTodoText] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchTodos = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/todos');
      const data = await response.json();
      setTodos(data);
    };

    fetchTodos();
  }, []);

  const handleAddTodo = async () => {
    if (!newTodoText) return;

    const response = await fetch('/api/todos', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ text: newTodoText }),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const newTodo = await response.json();
      setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
      setNewTodoText('');
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to add todo');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={newTodoText}
          onChange={(e) => setNewTodoText(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button onClick={handleAddTodo}>Add Todo</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation of Client Component:**

*   `'use client';`:  Marks this component as a Client Component.  It's essential for using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
*   `useState`:  Manages the list of todos and the input text for adding new todos.
*   `useEffect`:  Fetches the initial list of todos from the `/api/todos` endpoint when the component mounts.
*   `handleAddTodo`:  Sends a POST request to the `/api/todos` endpoint to create a new todo.  It updates the local state with the newly created todo if the request is successful.
*   Fetch API: Uses the `fetch` API to make requests to the Route Handlers.
*   Error Handling: Basic error handling to log failures to add todos.

## Request and Response Objects

The `request` and `NextResponse` objects provide a wealth of information and functionality for handling requests and crafting responses.

**Request Object:**

The `request` object provides information about the incoming HTTP request.  Key properties and methods include:

*   `request.url`: The full URL of the request.
*   `request.method`: The HTTP method used for the request (e.g., "GET", "POST").
*   `request.headers`:  An object containing the request headers.
*   `request.json()`:  Parses the request body as JSON.  (Async)
*   `request.text()`:  Parses the request body as plain text. (Async)
*   `request.arrayBuffer()`:  Parses the request body as an ArrayBuffer. (Async)
*   `request.formData()`: Parses the request body as FormData (for file uploads). (Async)
*   `request.nextUrl.searchParams`:  An object containing the query parameters. (See example below)

**Example of accessing query parameters:**

```typescript filename="app/api/search/route.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams;
  const query = searchParams.get('query');
  const page = searchParams.get('page');

  // Use the query and page values to fetch data from a database or API
  // ...

  return NextResponse.json({ query, page });
}
```

**NextResponse Object:**

The `NextResponse` object allows you to create and customize HTTP responses. Key methods include:

*   `NextResponse.json(data, options)`: Creates a JSON response.
    *   `data`: The data to be serialized as JSON.
    *   `options`:  Optional options for the response, such as `status` (HTTP status code) and `headers`.
*   `NextResponse.redirect(url, options)`: Creates a redirect response.
*   `NextResponse.rewrite(url, options)`: Rewrites the request to a different URL (client remains on the original URL).
*   `NextResponse.next()`:  Passes the request to the next middleware in the chain.  Important for middleware execution order.
*   `new NextResponse(body, init)`:  Creates a response with a custom body (string, ReadableStream, or ArrayBuffer). `init` is an optional object for setting headers and status.

**Example of setting headers and status code:**

```typescript filename="app/api/custom-response/route.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { message: 'Custom response with headers and status' },
    {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-Custom-Header': 'My Custom Value',
      },
    }
  );
}
```

## Dynamic Route Segments

Route Handlers support dynamic route segments, allowing you to create APIs that accept parameters in the URL.  To create a dynamic route segment, use square brackets in the folder name.

For example, to create an endpoint at `/api/products/[id]`, you would create the following directory structure: `app/api/products/[id]`.

Inside the `route.ts` file, you can access the dynamic segment using the `params` property in the function argument.  **Important**: The function signature changes slightly.

```typescript filename="app/api/products/[id]/route.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
}

const products: Product[] = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Product A', description: 'Description of Product A' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Product B', description: 'Description of Product B' },
];

//The function signature is different now
export async function GET(request: Request, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const id = params.id;

  const product = products.find((p) => p.id === id);

  if (!product) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Product not found' }, { status: 404 });
  }

  return NextResponse.json(product);
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `{ params }: { params: { id: string } }`: This destructures the `params` object from the function argument and also provides type safety.  The `id` property is now available as `params.id`.  The type annotation ` { params: { id: string } }` is crucial for TypeScript to understand the structure of the `params` object.
*   The code then retrieves the product ID from `params.id` and searches for the product in the `products` array.

## Middleware Integration

Route Handlers seamlessly integrate with Next.js Middleware, allowing you to intercept and modify requests and responses before they reach your Route Handler.

**Example:**

Create a middleware file named `middleware.ts` (or `middleware.js`) at the root of your project:

```typescript filename="middleware.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const apiKey = request.headers.get('x-api-key');

  if (apiKey !== 'your-secret-api-key') {
    return new NextResponse(
      JSON.stringify({ success: false, message: 'Unauthorized' }),
      { status: 401, headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' } }
    );
  }

  return NextResponse.next(); // Continue to the route handler
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/api/:path*', // Apply the middleware to all paths under /api/
};
```

**Explanation:**

*   `middleware(request: NextRequest)`: This function is executed for every request that matches the `matcher`.
*   `request.headers.get('x-api-key')`: Retrieves the value of the `x-api-key` header from the request.
*   The middleware checks if the API key is valid. If not, it returns a `401 Unauthorized` response.
*   `NextResponse.next()`:  Crucially, this passes the request to the next middleware (if any) and then to the Route Handler.  Without this, the request will be terminated in the middleware.
*   `config.matcher`: Specifies which paths the middleware should be applied to.  In this example, it applies to all paths under `/api/`.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Middleware Execution Order:** Middleware executes in the order it's defined. Make sure to define your middleware in the correct order to avoid unexpected behavior.
*   **`NextResponse.next()` is Crucial:**  Remember to call `NextResponse.next()` to pass the request to the next middleware or the Route Handler.
*   **`config.matcher`:** Use the `matcher` to limit the scope of your middleware and improve performance.

## Advanced Usage: Streaming

Route Handlers support streaming responses, allowing you to send data to the client incrementally.  This is particularly useful for large datasets or long-running operations.

```typescript filename="app/api/stream/route.ts"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

async function* generateData() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Simulate delay
    yield `Data chunk ${i + 1}\n`;
  }
}

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      for await (const chunk of generateData()) {
        controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(chunk));
      }
      controller.close();
    },
  });

  return new NextResponse(stream, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
    },
  });
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `generateData()`: This asynchronous generator function yields chunks of data with a delay.  This simulates a long-running process.
*   `ReadableStream`:  A JavaScript API for reading streams of data.  In this example, we create a `ReadableStream` that consumes the data from the `generateData()` generator.
*   `controller.enqueue()`:  Adds a chunk of data to the stream.  The `TextEncoder().encode()` converts the string chunk to a Uint8Array, which is required by the `enqueue()` method.
*   `controller.close()`: Closes the stream when all data has been sent.
*   `new NextResponse(stream)`: Creates a response with the `ReadableStream` as the body.  The `Content-Type` header is set to `text/plain` to indicate that the response is plain text.

**Benefits of Streaming:**

*   **Improved Performance:**  The client can start receiving data before the entire response is generated.
*   **Better User Experience:** The user sees progress updates as data is streamed, rather than waiting for the entire response to load.
*   **Reduced Memory Usage:**  The server doesn't need to hold the entire response in memory before sending it to the client.

## Best Practices

*   **Use TypeScript:** Take advantage of TypeScript's type safety to improve code quality and reduce errors.
*   **Handle Errors Gracefully:**  Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions and return informative error messages to the client.
*   **Validate Input:**  Validate user input to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
*   **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, in environment variables.
*   **Implement Caching:**  Use caching strategies, such as Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) or On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (On-Demand ISR), to improve performance and reduce server load.
*   **Keep Route Handlers Focused:** Each Route Handler should have a specific responsibility.  Avoid putting too much logic in a single handler.  Consider creating helper functions or modules to encapsulate complex logic.
*   **Consider Server Actions:** For form handling and mutations, Server Actions often provide a cleaner solution than Route Handlers, especially when coupled with React Server Components.  Route Handlers are better suited for building APIs.

## Route Handlers vs. API Routes (pages/api)

While API Routes in `pages/api` still work, Route Handlers in the `app` directory offer several advantages:

| Feature          | Route Handlers (`app` directory) | API Routes (`pages/api`) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Colocation       | Yes                                | No                         |
| Middleware Integration | Seamless                          | More complex             |
| Type Safety      | Excellent (TypeScript)             | Good (with manual types)   |
| Streaming        | Yes                                | Limited                    |
| Framework Features | Full Access                         | Limited                    |
|  File Structure   | Aligned with components           | Separate folder           |

Route Handlers are generally recommended for new projects and offer a more modern and integrated approach to building APIs in Next.js. Migrating from API Routes to Route Handlers is generally a good idea, although it might require some refactoring.

## Conclusion
