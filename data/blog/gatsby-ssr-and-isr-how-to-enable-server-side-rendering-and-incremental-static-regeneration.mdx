# Gatsby SSR and ISR: How to Enable Server-Side Rendering and Incremental Static Regeneration

Gatsby, a popular React-based static site generator, has evolved significantly. While traditionally focused on generating static HTML at build time, it now offers powerful options for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to deliver a more dynamic and performant user experience. This post will guide you through enabling these features in your Gatsby project.

## Understanding SSR and ISR: Why They Matter

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand the benefits of SSR and ISR:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** SSR involves rendering React components on the server for each request. This offers several advantages:

  - **Improved SEO:** Search engine crawlers can easily index the fully rendered HTML, leading to better search engine rankings.
  - **Faster First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Users see content faster as the browser receives complete HTML from the server, reducing the time to render the initial page.
  - **Better Performance on Low-Powered Devices:** Offloads rendering from the client's browser to the server.

- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** ISR allows you to generate static pages on demand, after your initial build. Think of it as a hybrid approach.
  - **On-Demand Rebuild:** Instead of rebuilding your entire site for content updates, ISR can rebuild only specific pages when needed, drastically reducing build times.
  - **Fresh Content with Static Site Benefits:** ISR provides the performance advantages of a static site while ensuring content freshness by re-generating pages in the background.
  - **Cost-Effective:** ISR is generally more cost-effective than SSR due to reduced server processing.

## Enabling SSR in Gatsby

Gatsby leverages its [Gatsby Functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/) feature to enable SSR. Gatsby Functions are essentially serverless functions that run on the server when a user requests a specific route.

**Steps to Enable SSR:**

1.  **Install the Necessary Plugins:**

    You'll primarily need the `@gatsbyjs/functions` plugin. Install it using npm or yarn:

    ```plaintext
    npm install @gatsbyjs/functions
    # or
    yarn add @gatsbyjs/functions
    ```

2.  **Configure `gatsby-config.js`:**

    Add the `@gatsbyjs/functions` plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` file:

    ```plaintext
    // gatsby-config.js
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [`@gatsbyjs/functions`],
    }
    ```

3.  **Create a Gatsby Function:**

    Create a directory named `src/api` at the root of your Gatsby project. Inside this directory, create a JavaScript or TypeScript file for your function (e.g., `src/api/my-ssr-function.js`). The filename will determine the route. For example, `src/api/my-ssr-function.js` will be available at the route `/api/my-ssr-function`.

    **Example:** Let's create a simple function that returns a server-rendered greeting.

    ```plaintext
    // src/api/my-ssr-function.js
    export default async function handler(req, res) {
      const name = req.query.name || 'World' // Get name from query parameter

      // Render the HTML on the server
      const html = `
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
          <title>SSR Example</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>Hello, ${name}! (Server-Side Rendered)</h1>
        </body>
        </html>
      `

      res.status(200).setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html').send(html)
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - The `handler` function receives the `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects.
    - It retrieves the `name` query parameter from the request.
    - It dynamically generates HTML on the server, including the greeting.
    - It sets the `Content-Type` header to `text/html` to inform the browser that it's receiving HTML content.
    - It sends the HTML content as the response.

4.  **Access the Function:**

    Now, you can access your server-rendered function by visiting `/api/my-ssr-function` in your browser. You can also pass a name parameter, like `/api/my-ssr-function?name=Gatsby`.

5.  **Integrate with Your Gatsby Components:**

    While the example above serves the entire HTML document, in a real-world scenario, you'd fetch data within your Gatsby function and pass it to your React components for server-side rendering. You could then return a smaller HTML snippet or JSON data. Your client-side components would then use this data.

    Here's a more complete example of how to integrate SSR into your Gatsby components.

    **a. Create a Component:**

    ```jsx
    // src/components/Greeting.js
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

    const Greeting = ({ initialName }) => {
      const [name, setName] = useState(initialName || 'Loading...')

      useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchData() {
          // If initialName is provided (from SSR), don't fetch again on the client.
          if (initialName) {
            return
          }
          try {
            const response = await fetch('/api/greeting')
            const data = await response.json()
            setName(data.name)
          } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching greeting:', error)
            setName('Error!')
          }
        }

        fetchData()
      }, [initialName])

      return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
    }

    export default Greeting
    ```

    **b. Gatsby Function:**

    ```plaintext
    // src/api/greeting.js
    export default async function handler(req, res) {
      // Simulate fetching data from a database or API
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500)) // Simulate delay

      const name = 'Gatsby User'

      res.status(200).json({ name })
    }
    ```

    **c. Page Component using SSR:**

    ```jsx
    // src/pages/ssr-example.js
    import React from 'react'
    import Greeting from '../components/Greeting'

    const SSRPage = ({ serverData }) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Server-Side Rendering Example</h1>
          <Greeting initialName={serverData?.name} />
        </div>
      )
    }

    export async function getServerData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(`${process.env.GATSBY_URL || ''}/api/greeting`) // Use environment variable
        const data = await response.json()

        return {
          props: {
            serverData: data,
          },
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data in getServerData:', error)
        return {
          status: 500,
          headers: {},
          props: {},
        }
      }
    }

    export default SSRPage
    ```

    **Important Considerations for SSR:**

    - **`getServerData` Function:** Gatsby provides a `getServerData` function in your page components (like `src/pages/ssr-example.js`). This function runs on the server _during build time_ when deployed to Gatsby Cloud and _at runtime_ when using `gatsby develop`. This function should fetch the necessary data for the component and return it as `props`.
    - **Environment Variables:** Make sure to use environment variables (like `GATSBY_URL`) to dynamically determine the base URL of your Gatsby site, especially when deploying to different environments. Set this variable in your `gatsby-config.js` file, and Gatsby Cloud environment variables. Note that the prefix of the enviroment variable has to be `GATSBY_` for use in Browser and `process.env`
    - **Client-Side Fallback:** Consider a client-side fallback mechanism in case the server-side rendering fails or the initial data is not available. This prevents a blank page from being displayed. In the example, if `serverData` is unavailable, the `Greeting` component will fetch the data client-side.
    - **Authentication:** Handling authentication with SSR can be complex. You'll likely need to manage cookies or tokens securely on the server.

## Enabling Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Gatsby

ISR can be enabled using the `unstable_onPostRebuild` API in `gatsby-node.js`. This API allows you to trigger rebuilds of specific pages when content changes, without having to rebuild the entire site. This feature is currently available in Gatsby Cloud.

**Steps to Enable ISR:**

1.  **Ensure Gatsby Cloud Integration:** ISR is designed to work seamlessly with Gatsby Cloud. Make sure your Gatsby site is connected to Gatsby Cloud.

2.  **Implement `unstable_onPostRebuild` in `gatsby-node.js`:**

    Add the `unstable_onPostRebuild` API to your `gatsby-node.js` file. This API is triggered after a successful build on Gatsby Cloud.

    ```plaintext
    // gatsby-node.js
    exports.unstable_onPostRebuild = async ({ reporter }) => {
      // Your logic to determine which pages need to be rebuilt.
      // This is typically based on content updates in your CMS.

      // Example: Let's say you have a CMS that provides an API endpoint
      // that tells you which blog posts have been updated.

      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://your-cms.com/api/updated-posts')
        const updatedPosts = await response.json()

        if (updatedPosts && updatedPosts.length > 0) {
          reporter.info(`Rebuilding ${updatedPosts.length} posts`)

          // Trigger a rebuild of each updated post.
          await Promise.all(
            updatedPosts.map(async (post) => {
              // The path to the page you want to rebuild (e.g., /blog/my-post)
              const path = `/blog/${post.slug}`

              try {
                // Trigger a rebuild for this specific path.
                await fetch('https://your-gatsby-site.com/.netlify/functions/__revalidate', {
                  method: 'POST',
                  headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                  },
                  body: JSON.stringify({
                    secret: process.env.GATSBY_CLOUD_REVALIDATE_SECRET, // Your secret key
                    path,
                  }),
                })
                reporter.info(`Successfully revalidated path: ${path}`)
              } catch (error) {
                reporter.error(`Error revalidating path ${path}:`, error)
              }
            })
          )
        } else {
          reporter.info('No posts to rebuild.')
        }
      } catch (error) {
        reporter.error('Error fetching updated posts:', error)
      }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - **`unstable_onPostRebuild`:** This is the Gatsby API that is called after a successful build.
    - **Fetching Updated Content:** The example code fetches a list of updated posts from a hypothetical CMS API (`https://your-cms.com/api/updated-posts`). You'll need to replace this with your actual CMS API endpoint.
    - **`reporter`:** This object allows you to log information and errors during the rebuild process.
    - **`https://your-gatsby-site.com/.netlify/functions/__revalidate`:** This is an endpoint that Gatsby Cloud provides for triggering rebuilds of specific pages. You'll need to replace `https://your-gatsby-site.com` with your actual Gatsby site URL.
    - **`GATSBY_CLOUD_REVALIDATE_SECRET`:** This is a secret key that you need to configure in your Gatsby Cloud environment variables. This key is used to authenticate the revalidation request. You also need to set this environment variable locally if developing ISR.
    - **`path`:** This is the path to the page that you want to rebuild.

3.  **Configure Gatsby Cloud Environment Variables:**

    - **`GATSBY_CLOUD_REVALIDATE_SECRET`:** Set this environment variable in your Gatsby Cloud environment variables. Generate a strong, unique secret key. Keep this key secure.

4.  **CMS Integration:**

    The key to successful ISR is integrating it with your CMS. When content is updated in your CMS, you need to trigger a build in Gatsby Cloud, which will then execute the `unstable_onPostRebuild` function and rebuild the necessary pages. This usually involves setting up a webhook in your CMS that triggers a Gatsby Cloud build when content is updated.

**Important Considerations for ISR:**

- **Gatsby Cloud:** ISR is tightly integrated with Gatsby Cloud. It's the recommended (and often only) way to achieve true ISR.
- **CMS Webhooks:** Setting up CMS webhooks is crucial for automatically triggering rebuilds when content changes.
- **`GATSBY_CLOUD_REVALIDATE_SECRET`:** Protect your revalidation secret. Treat it like a password.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your `unstable_onPostRebuild` function to prevent rebuild failures from stopping the process.
- **Concurrency Limits:** Gatsby Cloud has concurrency limits on the number of rebuilds that can be triggered simultaneously. Be mindful of these limits when rebuilding a large number of pages.

## Choosing Between SSR and ISR

- **SSR:** Best suited for pages that require highly dynamic content that changes frequently and needs to be up-to-date for every request. Examples include e-commerce shopping carts, user dashboards, or pages with personalized recommendations.

- **ISR:** Best suited for content that is updated periodically, but doesn't require real-time updates. Examples include blog posts, news articles, product catalogs, or documentation. ISR offers a good balance between performance and content freshness.

## Conclusion

SSR and ISR are powerful tools for enhancing the performance, SEO, and content freshness of your Gatsby sites. By understanding the benefits of each approach and carefully implementing the steps outlined in this guide, you can create a better user experience and achieve better results for your Gatsby projects. Remember to leverage Gatsby Cloud for optimal ISR performance and to thoroughly test your implementation to ensure it's working as expected.
