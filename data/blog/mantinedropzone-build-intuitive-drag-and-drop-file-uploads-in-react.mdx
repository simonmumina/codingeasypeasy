# @mantine/dropzone: Build Intuitive Drag & Drop File Uploads in React

Handling file uploads is a common requirement in modern web applications. Providing a seamless and intuitive user experience is crucial, and that's where `@mantine/dropzone` comes in. This powerful React component from the Mantine UI library simplifies the process of implementing drag and drop file upload functionality, offering a range of customization options and built-in features to enhance your application.

## What is @mantine/dropzone?

`@mantine/dropzone` is a React component designed for effortless implementation of drag and drop file upload zones. It leverages the power of Mantine's theming and styling capabilities, providing a visually appealing and customizable solution for handling file uploads. Key features include:

- **Drag and Drop Support:** Allows users to effortlessly upload files by dragging and dropping them into the designated area.
- **Click to Upload:** Provides an alternative upload method by allowing users to click the dropzone to select files from their system.
- **File Validation:** Supports file type and size validation to ensure only acceptable files are uploaded.
- **Customizable Appearance:** Easily customize the dropzone's appearance to match your application's design using Mantine's theming system.
- **File Preview Generation:** Provides built-in support for generating previews of uploaded images and other file types.
- **Accessibility:** Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a positive experience for all users.
- **Clear Callback Functions:** Offers well-defined callback functions for handling different events, such as file acceptance, rejection, and dropzone state changes.

## Getting Started: Installation and Basic Usage

First, ensure you have Mantine UI already set up in your React project. If not, follow the official Mantine documentation for installation instructions: [https://mantine.dev/](https://mantine.dev/)

Once Mantine is set up, install the `@mantine/dropzone` package:

```plaintext
npm install @mantine/dropzone @mantine/hooks
# or
yarn add @mantine/dropzone @mantine/hooks
# or
pnpm add @mantine/dropzone @mantine/hooks
```

Note that `@mantine/hooks` is also required for using the `useDropzone` hook, which is the foundation of `@mantine/dropzone`.

Now, let's create a basic dropzone component:

```plaintext
import { Dropzone, DropzoneProps, IMAGE_MIME_TYPE } from '@mantine/dropzone';
import { Group, Text } from '@mantine/core';
import { IconCloudUpload, IconPhoto, IconX } from '@tabler/icons-react';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyDropzone() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);

  return (
    <Dropzone
      onDrop={(acceptedFiles) => setFiles([...files, ...acceptedFiles])}
      onReject={(rejectedFiles) => console.log('rejected files', rejectedFiles)}
      maxFiles={5}
      accept={{
        'image/*': IMAGE_MIME_TYPE,
      }}
    >
      <Group position="center" spacing="xl" style={{ minHeight: 220, pointerEvents: 'none' }}>
        <IconCloudUpload size={80} stroke={1.5} />

        <div>
          <Text size="xl" inline>
            Drag images here or click to select files
          </Text>
          <Text size="sm" color="dimmed" inline mt={7}>
            Attach as many files as you like, each file should be less than 5mb
          </Text>
        </div>
      </Group>
    </Dropzone>
  );
}

export default MyDropzone;
```

In this example:

- We import necessary components from `@mantine/dropzone`, `@mantine/core`, and `@tabler/icons-react`.
- We use the `<Dropzone>` component, passing in the `onDrop` and `onReject` props.
- `onDrop` is called when files are successfully dropped or selected, receiving an array of `File` objects. We update the local state `files` to store the uploaded files.
- `onReject` is called when files are rejected based on the `accept` or `maxFiles` props.
- The `accept` prop specifies the accepted file types. We're using `IMAGE_MIME_TYPE` for images.
- The `maxFiles` prop sets the maximum number of allowed files.
- Inside the `<Dropzone>` component, we use Mantine's `<Group>` and `<Text>` components to create a visually appealing message that guides the user.
- We use icons from `@tabler/icons-react` for a better user experience.

## Key Props and Customization Options

The `<Dropzone>` component offers a wide range of props for customization:

- **`onDrop: (files: File[]) => void`:** A function that is called when files are successfully dropped or selected. Receives an array of `File` objects.
- **`onDropRejected: (files: FileRejection[]) => void`:** A function that is called when files are rejected (e.g., due to invalid file type or size). Receives an array of `FileRejection` objects, which contain the `File` object and an array of `FileError` objects.
- **`onDropAccepted: (files: File[]) => void`:** A function that is called when files are successfully dropped or selected AND accepted according to the provided `accept` prop. Receives an array of `File` objects.
- **`onReject: (files: FileRejection[]) => void`:** Alias for `onDropRejected`.
- **`accept: DropzoneOptions['accept']`:** An object specifying the accepted file types. You can use MIME types or file extensions. For example: `{ 'image/*': ['.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'] }`. The keys represent the MIME type and the values are arrays of accepted file extensions.
- **`maxSize: number`:** The maximum file size in bytes.
- **`minSize: number`:** The minimum file size in bytes.
- **`maxFiles: number`:** The maximum number of files that can be uploaded.
- **`multiple: boolean`:** Whether to allow multiple files to be selected. Defaults to `true`.
- **`disabled: boolean`:** Whether the dropzone is disabled.
- **`openRef: React.RefObject<HTMLInputElement>`:** A ref to the hidden file input element, allowing you to programmatically trigger the file selection dialog. This is useful for creating custom buttons to open the file dialog.
- **`loading: boolean`:** Displays a loading indicator inside the dropzone.
- **`getFilesFromEvent: (event: Event) => Promise<File[]>`:** A function to override the default file retrieval from the drop event. Useful for handling data URLs or other non-file data.
- **`children: React.ReactNode | ((status: DropzoneStatus) => React.ReactNode)`:** The content to display inside the dropzone. You can also pass a function that receives the dropzone status (`DropzoneStatus` type) and returns the content. `DropzoneStatus` includes: `acceptedFiles`, `rejectedFiles`, `isFocused`, `isDragActive`, `isDragAccept`, `isDragReject`. This allows you to dynamically change the dropzone's appearance based on its state.
- **`className: string`:** CSS class to apply to the dropzone.
- **`style: React.CSSProperties`:** Inline styles to apply to the dropzone.
- **`sx: MantineStyleProp`:** Mantine style override for the dropzone. Allows you to use Mantine's styling functions.

## Handling Accepted and Rejected Files

The `onDrop` prop receives an array of `File` objects representing the successfully uploaded files. You can then process these files, such as uploading them to a server or displaying previews. The `onDropRejected` (or `onReject`) prop receives an array of `FileRejection` objects, which contain information about the rejected files and the reason for rejection.

Here's an example of handling accepted and rejected files:

```plaintext
import { Dropzone, DropzoneProps, IMAGE_MIME_TYPE } from '@mantine/dropzone';
import { Group, Text, Alert } from '@mantine/core';
import { IconCloudUpload, IconX } from '@tabler/icons-react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { FileRejection } from 'react-dropzone';

function MyDropzone() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
  const [rejectedFiles, setRejectedFiles] = useState<FileRejection[]>([]);

  const handleDrop = (acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    setFiles([...files, ...acceptedFiles]);
    setRejectedFiles([]); // Clear previous rejections when new files are dropped
  };

  const handleReject = (rejectedFiles: FileRejection[]) => {
    setRejectedFiles(rejectedFiles);
    setFiles([]); // Clear previously accepted files if any are rejected to ensure consistent state
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Dropzone
        onDrop={handleDrop}
        onReject={handleReject}
        maxSize={5 * 1024 * 1024} // 5MB
        accept={{
          'image/*': IMAGE_MIME_TYPE,
        }}
      >
        <Group position="center" spacing="xl" style={{ minHeight: 220, pointerEvents: 'none' }}>
          <IconCloudUpload size={80} stroke={1.5} />

          <div>
            <Text size="xl" inline>
              Drag images here or click to select files
            </Text>
            <Text size="sm" color="dimmed" inline mt={7}>
              Attach as many files as you like, each file should be less than 5mb
            </Text>
          </div>
        </Group>
      </Dropzone>

      {rejectedFiles.length > 0 && (
        <Alert
          icon={<IconX size="sm" />}
          title="Rejected Files"
          color="red"
          mt="md"
        >
          {rejectedFiles.map((fileRejection, index) => (
            <div key={index}>
              {fileRejection.file.name} - {fileRejection.errors.map((error) => error.message).join(', ')}
            </div>
          ))}
        </Alert>
      )}

      {files.length > 0 && (
        <Group mt="md">
          {files.map((file, index) => (
            <Text key={index}>{file.name}</Text>
          ))}
        </Group>
      )}
    </>
  );
}

export default MyDropzone;
```

In this enhanced example:

- We added state to track both `files` (accepted files) and `rejectedFiles`.
- We implemented `handleDrop` and `handleReject` functions to update the state accordingly. Importantly, the example now clears `rejectedFiles` when new files are dropped and clears `files` when there are rejections, thus preventing inconsistencies in what gets stored in the component.
- We added a `maxSize` prop to limit the file size to 5MB.
- We display an `<Alert>` component from Mantine to inform the user about rejected files and their reasons. This provides valuable feedback to the user.
- We display the names of the accepted files in a `<Group>` component.

## Displaying File Previews

Displaying previews of uploaded images can greatly enhance the user experience. `@mantine/dropzone` doesn't directly handle preview generation, but you can easily integrate it with other libraries or use the browser's built-in `URL.createObjectURL` method.

Here's an example of displaying image previews:

```plaintext
import { Dropzone, DropzoneProps, IMAGE_MIME_TYPE } from '@mantine/dropzone';
import { Group, Text, Image, Box } from '@mantine/core';
import { IconCloudUpload } from '@tabler/icons-react';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyDropzone() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
  const [previewUrls, setPreviewUrls] = useState<string[]>([]);

  const handleDrop = (acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    setFiles(acceptedFiles);
    const urls = acceptedFiles.map((file) => URL.createObjectURL(file));
    setPreviewUrls(urls);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Dropzone
        onDrop={handleDrop}
        accept={{
          'image/*': IMAGE_MIME_TYPE,
        }}
      >
        <Group position="center" spacing="xl" style={{ minHeight: 220, pointerEvents: 'none' }}>
          <IconCloudUpload size={80} stroke={1.5} />

          <div>
            <Text size="xl" inline>
              Drag images here or click to select files
            </Text>
            <Text size="sm" color="dimmed" inline mt={7}>
              Attach as many files as you like
            </Text>
          </div>
        </Group>
      </Dropzone>

      <Group mt="md">
        {previewUrls.map((url, index) => (
          <Box key={index} sx={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}>
            <Image src={url} alt={`Preview ${index + 1}`} width={100} height={100} radius="md" />
          </Box>
        ))}
      </Group>
    </>
  );
}

export default MyDropzone;
```

In this example:

- We added state to store the preview URLs (`previewUrls`).
- In the `handleDrop` function, we use `URL.createObjectURL` to generate a URL for each accepted file.
- We then display the previews using Mantine's `<Image>` component, iterating over the `previewUrls` array. We wrap each `<Image>` component in a `<Box>` to control its size and appearance.
- The `URL.createObjectURL` method creates a temporary URL that represents the file in memory. Remember to revoke these URLs when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks using `URL.revokeObjectURL`. This is particularly important for single-page applications. You can do this in a `useEffect` hook with a cleanup function:

```plaintext
import { useEffect } from 'react'
// ... other imports

function MyDropzone() {
  // ... state and handleDrop function

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      previewUrls.forEach((url) => URL.revokeObjectURL(url))
    }
  }, [previewUrls])

  // ... rest of the component
}
```

## Using the `useDropzone` Hook Directly

For more fine-grained control, you can use the `useDropzone` hook directly. This hook provides the core functionality of the dropzone without rendering any UI. You are then responsible for creating your own UI and connecting it to the hook's state and functions.

```plaintext
import { useDropzone } from '@mantine/dropzone';
import { Button, Text, Group } from '@mantine/core';
import { useState } from 'react';

function CustomDropzone() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, open, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop: (acceptedFiles) => {
      setFiles(acceptedFiles);
    },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div {...getRootProps()} style={{ border: '1px dashed #ccc', padding: '20px', textAlign: 'center', cursor: 'pointer' }}>
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        {isDragActive ? (
          <Text>Drop the files here ...</Text>
        ) : (
          <Text>Drag 'n' drop some files here, or click to select files</Text>
        )}
      </div>

      <Button mt="md" onClick={open}>
        Open File Dialog
      </Button>

      <Group mt="md">
        {files.map((file, index) => (
          <Text key={index}>{file.name}</Text>
        ))}
      </Group>
    </>
  );
}

export default CustomDropzone;
```

In this example:

- We use the `useDropzone` hook to get the `getRootProps`, `getInputProps`, `open`, and `isDragActive` values.
- We apply the `getRootProps` to the outer `div` to make it the dropzone area.
- We apply the `getInputProps` to the hidden file input element.
- We use the `isDragActive` state to display different text based on whether a file is being dragged over the dropzone.
- We use the `open` function to programmatically open the file selection dialog when the button is clicked.

## Advanced Usage and Common Use Cases

- **Uploading files to a server:** Integrate the `onDrop` callback with your API to upload files to a server. You can use the `FormData` API to easily construct the request body.
- **Custom styling:** Use Mantine's styling system (e.g., `sx` prop, CSS modules) to customize the appearance of the dropzone to match your application's design.
- **Progress indicators:** Display a progress indicator while files are being uploaded. You can use a library like `axios` or the `fetch` API to track the upload progress and update the indicator accordingly.
- **Integration with form libraries:** Integrate `@mantine/dropzone` with form libraries like `react-hook-form` to seamlessly manage file uploads within your forms.

## Accessibility Considerations

Ensure your dropzone is accessible to all users by:

- Providing clear instructions on how to upload files.
- Using appropriate ARIA attributes to enhance the experience for users with screen readers. The `useDropzone` hook handles a lot of this for you.
- Providing keyboard navigation support.

## Conclusion

`@mantine/dropzone` offers a simple yet powerful way to implement drag and drop file uploads in your React applications. With its flexible customization options, built-in validation, and accessibility features, it's a valuable addition to any Mantine UI project. By following the examples and guidelines in this guide, you can quickly create intuitive and user-friendly file upload experiences. Remember to consider edge cases and provide clear feedback to your users for a robust and reliable implementation.
