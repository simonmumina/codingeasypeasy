# SQL Operators: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples for Data Manipulation

SQL operators are the backbone of any SQL query, enabling you to manipulate data, filter results, and perform complex comparisons. Understanding these operators is crucial for effectively interacting with databases. This guide provides a detailed overview of SQL operators, categorized by their functionality, along with practical code examples to illustrate their usage.

## What are SQL Operators?

SQL operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands (values or expressions). They are used within SQL statements (like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `UPDATE`, etc.) to specify conditions, perform calculations, and manipulate data.  Think of them as the verbs of the SQL language.

## Categories of SQL Operators

SQL operators can be broadly categorized into the following:

1.  **Comparison Operators:** Used to compare values.
2.  **Logical Operators:** Used to combine or negate conditions.
3.  **Arithmetic Operators:** Used to perform mathematical calculations.
4.  **String Operators:** Used to manipulate text strings.
5.  **Bitwise Operators:** Used to perform bitwise operations (less common).

Let's explore each category in detail.

## 1. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are fundamental for filtering data based on specific criteria. They allow you to compare values and return a boolean result (TRUE or FALSE).

| Operator | Description                                  | Example                                                |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `=`      | Equal to                                     | `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = 50000;`          |
| `>`      | Greater than                                 | `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100;`            |
| `<`      | Less than                                    | `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2024-01-01';` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to                     | `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age >= 18;`             |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to                        | `SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE quantity <= 50;`        |
| `!=` or `<>` | Not equal to (both are generally supported) | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE status != 'inactive';`        |
| `BETWEEN`| Between a specified range (inclusive)     | `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 150;`|
| `LIKE`   | Pattern matching (using wildcards)         | `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'A%';`          |
| `IN`     | Matches any value in a list                | `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing');` |
| `IS NULL`| Checks if a value is NULL                    | `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NULL;`     |
| `IS NOT NULL`| Checks if a value is NOT NULL             | `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NOT NULL;` |

**Examples:**

**1. Finding employees with a specific salary:**

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary = 60000;
```

This query selects the `employee_id` and `employee_name` from the `employees` table where the `salary` is equal to 60000.

**2.  Finding products within a price range:**

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 100;
```

This query selects the `product_name` and `price` from the `products` table where the `price` falls within the range of 50 to 100 (inclusive).

**3.  Finding customers whose names start with 'A':**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_name LIKE 'A%';
```

This query selects the `customer_id` and `customer_name` from the `customers` table where the `customer_name` starts with the letter 'A'. The `%` is a wildcard character that represents zero or more characters.

**4.  Finding products belonging to specific categories:**

```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM products
WHERE category IN ('Electronics', 'Books');
```

This query selects the `product_id` and `product_name` from the `products` table where the `category` is either 'Electronics' or 'Books'.

**5. Finding employees with a missing department:**

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department IS NULL;
```

This query selects the `employee_id` and `employee_name` from the `employees` table where the `department` value is `NULL`.  `NULL` indicates missing or unknown data.

## 2. Logical Operators

Logical operators allow you to combine or negate conditions in your SQL queries. They are used in conjunction with comparison operators to create more complex filtering criteria.

| Operator | Description                               | Example                                                                    |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AND`    | Returns TRUE if both conditions are TRUE  | `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000 AND department = 'Sales';`   |
| `OR`     | Returns TRUE if at least one condition is TRUE | `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA' OR country = 'Canada';`    |
| `NOT`    | Negates a condition                         | `SELECT * FROM products WHERE NOT category = 'Food';`                    |

**Examples:**

**1. Finding employees who earn more than 50000 AND work in the Sales department:**

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000 AND department = 'Sales';
```

This query selects employees that meet both criteria.

**2. Finding customers from the USA OR Canada:**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA' OR country = 'Canada';
```

This query selects customers from either the USA or Canada.

**3. Finding products that are NOT in the 'Food' category:**

```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name
FROM products
WHERE NOT category = 'Food';
```

This query selects all products that are *not* in the 'Food' category.

## 3. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations on numerical data.

| Operator | Description      | Example                                    |
| :------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition         | `SELECT price + tax FROM products;`        |
| `-`      | Subtraction      | `SELECT salary - deductions FROM employees;` |
| `*`      | Multiplication   | `SELECT quantity * price FROM orders;`       |
| `/`      | Division         | `SELECT total_price / quantity FROM orders;`|
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder)| `SELECT order_id % 2 FROM orders;`        |

**Examples:**

**1. Calculating the total price (including tax) of products:**

```sql
SELECT product_name, price, price + (price * 0.08) AS total_price
FROM products;
```

This query adds 8% tax to the original price and displays it as `total_price`.

**2. Calculating the net salary of employees after deductions:**

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary, salary - deductions AS net_salary
FROM employees;
```

This query subtracts deductions from the salary to calculate the `net_salary`.

**3. Calculating the remainder of order IDs when divided by 2:**

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_id % 2 AS remainder
FROM orders;
```

This can be useful for identifying even or odd order IDs.

## 4. String Operators

String operators are used to manipulate text strings. The specific string operators available can vary depending on the database system you're using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).  Here are some common examples:

| Operator | Description                                     | Example                                                                         | Database System Dependency |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------: |
| `||` or `+` | Concatenation (combining strings)              | `SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name FROM customers;`             |  PostgreSQL / SQL Server |
| `CONCAT()` | Concatenation (function)                    | `SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM customers;`          | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |
| `LIKE`   | Pattern matching (already covered in comparison) | `SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE 'Appl%';`                          | All                   |
| `SUBSTRING()` or `SUBSTR()` | Extract a portion of a string        | `SELECT SUBSTRING(product_name, 1, 5) FROM products;` (extracts the first 5 characters) | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |
| `LENGTH()` or `LEN()` |  Get the length of a string                   | `SELECT LENGTH(product_name) FROM products;`                                        | MySQL, PostgreSQL / SQL Server  |
| `UPPER()`  | Convert to uppercase                           | `SELECT UPPER(product_name) FROM products;`                                       | All                   |
| `LOWER()`  | Convert to lowercase                           | `SELECT LOWER(product_name) FROM products;`                                       | All                   |
| `TRIM()`   | Remove leading and trailing whitespace           | `SELECT TRIM(city) FROM customers;`                                            | All                   |

**Examples:**

**1. Concatenating first and last names to create a full name:**

```sql
-- PostgreSQL or SQL Server
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM customers;

-- MySQL
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM customers;
```

This query concatenates the `first_name` and `last_name` columns, separated by a space, and aliases the result as `full_name`.

**2. Extracting the first 5 characters of product names:**

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUBSTRING(product_name, 1, 5) AS short_name
FROM products;
```

This query extracts the first 5 characters from the `product_name` and displays them as `short_name`.

**3. Converting product names to uppercase:**

```sql
SELECT product_name, UPPER(product_name) AS uppercase_name
FROM products;
```

This query converts the `product_name` to uppercase and displays it as `uppercase_name`.

## 5. Bitwise Operators (Less Common)

Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representation of integer values. These are less commonly used in general SQL queries but can be useful in specific scenarios, such as working with flags or representing sets of values efficiently.  The availability and syntax can vary significantly between database systems.

| Operator | Description            | Example                                                                   | Database System Dependency |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------: |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND           | `SELECT value & 1 AS result FROM my_table;` (checks if the least significant bit is set)  | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |
| `\|`     | Bitwise OR            | `SELECT value \| 2 AS result FROM my_table;` (sets the second least significant bit)   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR           | `SELECT value ^ 3 AS result FROM my_table;` (toggles the first and second least significant bits)  | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT (Invert) | `SELECT ~value AS result FROM my_table;` (inverts all the bits) | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |
| `<<`     | Left Shift           | `SELECT value << 2 AS result FROM my_table;` (shifts bits two positions to the left, equivalent to multiplying by 4) | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |
| `>>`     | Right Shift          | `SELECT value >> 2 AS result FROM my_table;` (shifts bits two positions to the right, equivalent to dividing by 4) | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server  |

**Important Note:** Bitwise operators are not part of the SQL standard and their availability, syntax, and behavior can vary significantly between different database management systems. Consult your database system's documentation for specific details.

## Operator Precedence

Understanding operator precedence is important for writing correct and predictable SQL queries.  Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.  You can use parentheses `()` to override the default precedence and explicitly control the order of evaluation.

A common precedence order (from highest to lowest) is:

1.  Parentheses `()`
2.  Arithmetic Operators (`*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, `-`)
3.  Comparison Operators (`=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, `<>`, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`)
4.  Logical Operators (`NOT`, `AND`, `OR`)

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100 AND category = 'Electronics' OR quantity < 10;
```

Without parentheses, `AND` has higher precedence than `OR`. This query would be interpreted as:

`(price > 100 AND category = 'Electronics') OR quantity < 10`

To change the order of evaluation, use parentheses:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100 AND (category = 'Electronics' OR quantity < 10);
```

Now, the `OR` condition is evaluated first, and the query is interpreted as:

`price > 100 AND (category = 'Electronics' OR quantity < 10)`

## Conclusion
