# React Native Performance: Optimize Re-renders with Memoization (useMemo, useCallback, memo)

React Native allows us to build cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. However, performance issues can arise if components re-render unnecessarily. These unnecessary re-renders consume valuable CPU cycles and can lead to a sluggish user experience, especially on older devices or with complex UIs. One of the most effective strategies for boosting React Native performance is memoization. This article will delve into how to use memoization techniques, including `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`, to reduce re-renders and optimize your React Native applications.

## The Problem: Unnecessary Re-renders

Before diving into the solutions, let's understand the problem. A React component re-renders when its props or state change, or when its parent component re-renders. While some re-renders are necessary to reflect updated data, many can be redundant.

Consider this simple example:

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  console.log('ExpensiveComponent re-rendered!'); // Log on each render
  // Simulate an expensive calculation
  const result = data.map(item => item * 2).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Result: {result}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Simple data array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment Count" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <ExpensiveComponent data={data} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

In this example, `ExpensiveComponent` re-renders every time `ParentComponent` re-renders, even though the `data` prop hasn't changed. Clicking the "Increment Count" button causes a re-render of `ParentComponent`, which then triggers a re-render of `ExpensiveComponent`, resulting in unnecessary computation. This is where memoization comes to the rescue.

## Memoization Techniques in React Native

Memoization is an optimization technique where we cache the results of expensive function calls or component renderings and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. React provides several tools to implement memoization:

- **`React.memo`**: For memoizing functional components.
- **`useMemo`**: For memoizing the result of a function.
- **`useCallback`**: For memoizing functions themselves.

Let's explore each of these with examples.

### 1. `React.memo`: Memoizing Functional Components

`React.memo` is a higher-order component (HOC) that memoizes a functional component. It only re-renders the component if its props have changed.

**Example:**

```plaintext
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  console.log('ExpensiveComponent re-rendered!');
  // Simulate an expensive calculation
  const result = data.map(item => item * 2).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Result: {result}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const MemoizedExpensiveComponent = React.memo(ExpensiveComponent);

export default MemoizedExpensiveComponent;
```

Now, `ExpensiveComponent` will only re-render if the `data` prop changes. In our `ParentComponent` example, it will no longer re-render when the `count` state changes.

**Custom Comparison Function (Optional):**

`React.memo` performs a shallow comparison of the props. If you need a more complex comparison, you can provide a custom comparison function as the second argument:

```plaintext
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  console.log('ExpensiveComponent re-rendered!');
  // Simulate an expensive calculation
  const result = data.map(item => item * 2).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Result: {result}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const areEqual = (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison logic. Return true if props are equal, false otherwise.
  // For example, compare deeply nested objects or arrays.
  return JSON.stringify(prevProps.data) === JSON.stringify(nextProps.data);
};

const MemoizedExpensiveComponent = React.memo(ExpensiveComponent, areEqual);

export default MemoizedExpensiveComponent;
```

Use the custom comparison function with caution. It adds complexity and its performance should be considered. In many cases, ensuring data immutability is a better approach.

### 2. `useMemo`: Memoizing the Result of a Function

`useMemo` is a React hook that memoizes the result of a function. It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The function is only re-executed when one of the dependencies changes. The hook returns the memoized result.

**Example:**

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Performing expensive calculation...');
    return data.map(item => item * 2).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  }, [data]); // Only re-run if 'data' changes

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment Count" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <Text>Result: {expensiveCalculation}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

In this example, the `expensiveCalculation` function will only be re-executed when the `data` array changes. The result is memoized, and the same value is returned on subsequent renders until `data` changes. If we only increment the count, the calculation won't be rerun.

**When to Use `useMemo`:**

- When you have a computationally expensive function.
- When you need to pass a memoized value as a prop to a component that uses `React.memo`.

### 3. `useCallback`: Memoizing Functions

`useCallback` is a React hook that memoizes a function definition. It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The hook returns a memoized version of the function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.

**Example:**

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const MyButton = React.memo(({ onPress, title }) => {
  console.log('MyButton re-rendered!');
  return (
    <Button title={title} onPress={onPress} />
  );
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // No dependencies, so the function is only created once

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <MyButton title="Increment Count" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

In this example, `incrementCount` is memoized using `useCallback`. Since it has an empty dependency array `[]`, the function is only created once during the initial render. Without `useCallback`, a new function would be created on every render of `ParentComponent`, which would cause `MyButton` to re-render every time, even though its functionality remains the same. `MyButton` is wrapped with `React.memo` to only re-render when props change.

**Why is this important?**

Without `useCallback`, each re-render of `ParentComponent` would create a new `incrementCount` function, which would be passed as the `onPress` prop to `MyButton`. Because `MyButton` is using `React.memo`, it compares the new function reference to the previous one. Since function references are different every time, `React.memo` would determine that the props have changed, causing `MyButton` to re-render unnecessarily.

**When to Use `useCallback`:**

- When passing a function as a prop to a memoized component (`React.memo`).
- When a function is used as a dependency in another hook, such as `useEffect` or `useMemo`.

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

- **Immutability:** Memoization works best with immutable data structures. Modifying data directly can lead to unexpected behavior and missed memoization opportunities. Use techniques like the spread operator (`...`) or libraries like Immutable.js to ensure immutability.

  ```plaintext
  // Incorrect (Mutating state)
  const updateArray = () => {
    const newArray = myArray;
    newArray.push(newValue);
    setMyArray(newArray); // This might not trigger a re-render correctly
  };

  // Correct (Creating a new array)
  const updateArray = () => {
    setMyArray([...myArray, newValue]); // Creates a new array instance
  };
  ```

- **Over-Memoization:** Don't memoize everything! Memoization comes with a cost (memory overhead and the comparison logic). Only memoize components or functions that are known to be expensive or cause performance bottlenecks. Excessive memoization can actually _decrease_ performance.

- **Profiling:** Use React Native's performance profiling tools to identify components that are re-rendering frequently and unnecessarily. This will help you pinpoint the areas where memoization will have the most impact.

- **Dependency Arrays:** Be meticulous with dependency arrays in `useMemo` and `useCallback`. Include _all_ variables that the function depends on. Omitting a dependency can lead to stale closures and incorrect results. However, including too many dependencies can defeat the purpose of memoization.

- **Object.is vs Shallow Comparison:** `React.memo` performs shallow prop comparison using `Object.is`. This means it checks if the prop values are the same using strict equality (`===`). For objects and arrays, this only checks if the references are the same, not if the contents are the same. This is why immutability is critical.

- **Context API:** Changes to context providers can often trigger re-renders. Consider using techniques like creating specific contexts for specific data or using `useMemo` to memoize the values provided by the context.

- **List Rendering:** When rendering lists of items, ensure that each item has a stable and unique `key` prop. This helps React efficiently update the list without re-rendering entire subtrees.

- **Redux and Other State Management Libraries:** Be mindful of how your state management library interacts with React's rendering cycle. Consider using selectors to only connect components to the specific parts of the state they need. Libraries like Reselect are excellent for memoizing selectors.

## Example: Optimizing a List Component

Let's say you have a component that renders a list of items and updates each item frequently.

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';

const ListItem = ({ item, onUpdate }) => {
  console.log(`ListItem ${item.id} re-rendered!`);
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 10, borderBottomWidth: 1 }}>
      <Text>{item.text}</Text>
      <Button title="Update" onPress={() => onUpdate(item.id)} />
    </View>
  );
};

const ListComponent = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([
    { id: 1, text: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, text: 'Item 2' },
    { id: 3, text: 'Item 3' },
  ]);

  const updateItem = (id) => {
    setItems(items.map(item =>
      item.id === id ? { ...item, text: `Updated Item ${id}` } : item
    ));
  };

  const renderItem = ({ item }) => (
    <ListItem item={item} onUpdate={updateItem} />
  );

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={items}
      renderItem={renderItem}
      keyExtractor={item => item.id.toString()}
    />
  );
};

export default ListComponent;
```

Without optimization, updating one item will cause all list items to re-render because `ListComponent` re-renders and passes new `item` props to each `ListItem`. Let's optimize this:

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, FlatList } from 'react-native';

const ListItem = React.memo(({ item, onUpdate }) => {
  console.log(`ListItem ${item.id} re-rendered!`);
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 10, borderBottomWidth: 1 }}>
      <Text>{item.text}</Text>
      <Button title="Update" onPress={() => onUpdate(item.id)} />
    </View>
  );
});

const ListComponent = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([
    { id: 1, text: 'Item 1' },
    { id: 2, text: 'Item 2' },
    { id: 3, text: 'Item 3' },
  ]);

  const updateItem = useCallback((id) => {
    setItems(prevItems => prevItems.map(item =>
      item.id === id ? { ...item, text: `Updated Item ${id}` } : item
    ));
  }, []); // updateItem doesn't depend on any external variables

  const renderItem = useCallback(({ item }) => (
    <ListItem item={item} onUpdate={updateItem} />
  ), [updateItem]); //renderItem only depends on updateItem

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={items}
      renderItem={renderItem}
      keyExtractor={item => item.id.toString()}
    />
  );
};

export default ListComponent;
```

**Explanation of Optimizations:**

1.  **`React.memo(ListItem)`:** We memoize the `ListItem` component using `React.memo`. Now, it will only re-render if its `item` prop changes (or `onUpdate`, but we memoize that too).
2.  **`useCallback(updateItem, [])`:** We memoize the `updateItem` function using `useCallback` with an empty dependency array. This ensures that the function reference remains the same across re-renders of `ListComponent`. It is also important to ensure we are using the previous state in the `setItems` call.
3.  **`useCallback(renderItem, [updateItem])`:** Memoize the `renderItem` to prevent it from being recreated on every `ListComponent` render. Crucially, its dependency array includes `updateItem`, ensuring it's updated correctly when `updateItem` changes (although it won't change due to `useCallback` and its empty dependencies).

Now, when you update a single item, only that item's `ListItem` component will re-render, significantly improving performance, especially with large lists. The `FlatList` is also efficient at rendering large datasets when used correctly, including using the `keyExtractor` to provide unique, stable keys.

## Conclusion

Memoization is a powerful tool for optimizing React Native applications by reducing unnecessary re-renders. By strategically using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`, you can significantly improve performance and create a smoother, more responsive user experience. Remember to profile your application, understand the costs and benefits of memoization, and use these techniques judiciously for optimal results. Don't forget to ensure data immutability to maximize the effectiveness of your memoized components and functions.
