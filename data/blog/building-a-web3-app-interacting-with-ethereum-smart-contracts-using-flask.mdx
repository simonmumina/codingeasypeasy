# Building a Web3 App: Interacting with Ethereum Smart Contracts using Flask

This tutorial will guide you through building a simple web application using Flask, a popular Python web framework, that interacts with an Ethereum smart contract. We'll use `web3.py`, the official Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions, code examples, and explanations, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels who are interested in building decentralized applications (dApps).

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6+:** You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip:** Python's package installer. It usually comes pre-installed with Python 3.
- **Ganache (Optional):** A personal Ethereum blockchain for local development. Download from [https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache). If you don't use Ganache, you'll need access to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli). Make sure you have testnet ETH.
- **Metamask (Optional):** A browser extension that allows you to interact with decentralized applications. Download from [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/). Only required if you are connecting to a real testnet or mainnet.

## Setting up Your Development Environment

1.  **Create a Project Directory:**

    Create a new directory for your project:

    ```plaintext
    mkdir flask-web3-app
    cd flask-web3-app
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    It's best practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies:

    ```plaintext
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Install Flask and web3.py:

    ```plaintext
    pip install Flask web3
    ```

## Creating a Simple Smart Contract

For this tutorial, we'll use a very basic smart contract that stores and retrieves a simple string.

1.  **Create `SimpleStorage.sol`:**

    Create a new file named `SimpleStorage.sol` and add the following Solidity code:

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract SimpleStorage {
        string public storedData;

        constructor(string memory _initialData) {
            storedData = _initialData;
        }

        function set(string memory _data) public {
            storedData = _data;
        }

        function get() public view returns (string memory) {
            return storedData;
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Compile the Smart Contract:**

    You'll need a Solidity compiler (solc) to compile the contract. One way is to use `solc-cli`. If you don't have it, install it globally using npm:

    ```plaintext
    npm install -g solc-cli
    ```

    Then, compile the contract:

    ```plaintext
    solc --abi SimpleStorage.sol -o ./output --overwrite
    solc --bin SimpleStorage.sol -o ./output --overwrite
    ```

    This will generate two files in the `output` directory: `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.abi` (the ABI) and `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.bin` (the bytecode). Rename these for clarity:

    - Rename `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.abi` to `simple_storage.abi`
    - Rename `SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.bin` to `simple_storage.bin`

    Move these files into your project root (e.g., `flask-web3-app/simple_storage.abi`, `flask-web3-app/simple_storage.bin`).

## Building the Flask Application

Now, let's build the Flask application that will interact with the smart contract.

1.  **Create `app.py`:**

    Create a new file named `app.py` and add the following code:

    ```plaintext
    from flask import Flask, render_template, request
    from web3 import Web3
    import json
    import os

    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Configuration
    GANACHE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:7545"  # Replace with your Ganache or testnet URL
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3"  # Replace with your deployed contract address

    # Connect to Ethereum
    w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(GANACHE_URL))

    # Load contract ABI and bytecode
    with open('simple_storage.abi', 'r') as f:
        CONTRACT_ABI = json.load(f)

    # Connect to the contract
    contract = w3.eth.contract(address=CONTRACT_ADDRESS, abi=CONTRACT_ABI)

    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def index():
        if request.method == 'POST':
            # Get the new value from the form
            new_value = request.form['new_value']

            # Replace with your Metamask account or Ganache account
            account = w3.eth.accounts[0]

            # Build the transaction
            transaction = contract.functions.set(new_value).buildTransaction({
                'gas': 200000,  # Adjust gas limit as needed
                'from': account,
            })

            # Sign the transaction
            signed_txn = w3.eth.sign_transaction(transaction, w3.eth.accounts[0])

            # Send the transaction
            tx_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)

            # Wait for the transaction to be mined
            w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

            print(f"Transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")


        # Get the current value from the contract
        current_value = contract.functions.get().call()

        return render_template('index.html', current_value=current_value)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries: `Flask` for the web application, `render_template` for rendering HTML templates, `request` for handling form data, `Web3` for interacting with Ethereum, `json` for working with JSON data, and `os` to set ENV variables for `ganache`.
    - **Configuration:** Defines the URL of your Ganache instance (or a testnet URL) and the address of your deployed smart contract. **Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual Ganache/Testnet URL and contract address.
    - **Connect to Ethereum:** Creates a Web3 instance using an HTTP provider to connect to the Ethereum network.
    - **Load Contract ABI:** Loads the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract from the `simple_storage.abi` file. The ABI is a JSON representation of the contract's functions and data structures, allowing web3.py to interact with it.
    - **Connect to the Contract:** Creates a contract object using the contract address and ABI. This allows you to call functions on the smart contract.
    - **`index()` Route:** This route handles both GET and POST requests.
      - **GET Request:** Retrieves the current value from the `get()` function of the smart contract and renders the `index.html` template, passing the value as a variable.
      - **POST Request:** Handles form submissions.
        - Retrieves the new value from the form.
        - Builds a transaction object using the `set()` function of the smart contract.
          - Specifies the `gas` limit (adjust as needed).
          - Specifies the `from` address (your Metamask account or Ganache account). **Important**: Replace `w3.eth.accounts[0]` with the correct account if needed.
        - Signs the transaction using your private key. **Important:** This example uses the first account from Ganache for simplicity. **Never store private keys directly in your code in a real-world application!** Use a secure method like environment variables and the `eth-account` library.
        - Sends the raw transaction to the Ethereum network.
        - Waits for the transaction to be mined (included in a block).
        - Prints the transaction hash to the console.
    - **`app.run(debug=True)`:** Starts the Flask development server in debug mode.

2.  **Create `templates/index.html`:**

    Create a directory named `templates` in your project root and create a file named `index.html` inside it. Add the following code:

    ```plaintext
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Simple Storage</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Simple Storage</h1>
        <p>Current Value: {{ current_value }}</p>

        <form method="POST">
          <label for="new_value">New Value:</label>
          <input type="text" id="new_value" name="new_value" />
          <button type="submit">Set Value</button>
        </form>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - Displays the current value retrieved from the smart contract.
    - Creates a form with a text input field to enter a new value and a submit button to send the value to the smart contract.

## Deploying the Smart Contract (if necessary)

If you are using Ganache, you need to deploy the smart contract to your local blockchain. If you are using a public testnet, you may already have the contract deployed or you will need to deploy it.

1.  **Create `deploy.py` (for Ganache or deploying to a testnet):**

    ```plaintext
    from web3 import Web3
    import json
    import os

    # Configuration
    GANACHE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:7545"  # Replace with your Ganache or testnet URL

    # Connect to Ethereum
    w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(GANACHE_URL))

    # Load contract ABI and bytecode
    with open('simple_storage.abi', 'r') as f:
        CONTRACT_ABI = json.load(f)

    with open('simple_storage.bin', 'r') as f:
        CONTRACT_BYTECODE = f.read()

    # Create the contract object
    contract = w3.eth.contract(abi=CONTRACT_ABI, bytecode=CONTRACT_BYTECODE)

    # Replace with your Metamask account or Ganache account
    account = w3.eth.accounts[0]

    # Build the transaction to deploy the contract
    construct_txn = contract.constructor("Hello, World!").buildTransaction({
        'from': account,
        'gas': 2000000, # Adjust gas limit as needed
        'nonce': w3.eth.get_transaction_count(account) # Add the nonce
    })

    # Sign the transaction
    signed = w3.eth.sign_transaction(construct_txn, account)

    # Deploy the contract
    tx_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed.rawTransaction)

    # Wait for the transaction to be mined
    tx_receipt = w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

    # Print the contract address
    print(f"Contract deployed at address: {tx_receipt.contractAddress}")

    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - Similar to `app.py`, this script connects to the Ethereum network, loads the ABI and bytecode of the smart contract.
    - It then creates a contract object using the ABI and bytecode.
    - It builds a transaction to deploy the contract to the network. Note the constructor arguments `("Hello, World!")` which sets the initial value of `storedData`.
    - The transaction is signed and sent to the network.
    - The script waits for the transaction to be mined and then prints the address where the contract was deployed. **Copy this address and paste it into the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable in `app.py`.**
    - The `nonce` is necessary to avoid transaction replacement errors. It's the number of transactions already sent from this account.

2.  **Run `deploy.py`:**

    ```plaintext
    python deploy.py
    ```

    Copy the contract address that is printed to the console.

3.  **Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `app.py`:**

    Replace the placeholder `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `app.py` with the actual contract address you obtained from deploying the contract.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Flask development server:**

    ```plaintext
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your browser:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

You should see the web application with the current value from the smart contract. Enter a new value in the input field and click "Set Value". Your Metamask (if used) will prompt you to confirm the transaction. After the transaction is mined, the page will refresh and display the updated value.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has shown you how to build a simple web application using Flask and web3.py that interacts with an Ethereum smart contract. This is a basic example, but it provides a foundation for building more complex and feature-rich decentralized applications.
