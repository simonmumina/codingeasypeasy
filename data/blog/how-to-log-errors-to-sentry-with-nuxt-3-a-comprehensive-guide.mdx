# How to Log Errors to Sentry with Nuxt 3: A Comprehensive Guide

Effective error logging and monitoring are crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of your Nuxt 3 application. Sentry is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring platform that provides real-time insights into issues affecting your users. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Sentry with your Nuxt 3 project, enabling you to capture, analyze, and resolve errors efficiently.

## Why Use Sentry with Nuxt 3?

- **Real-time Error Tracking:** Sentry captures errors as they occur, providing immediate notifications and detailed diagnostic information.
- **Improved Debugging:** Sentry offers stack traces, breadcrumbs, and user context, making it easier to pinpoint the root cause of errors.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** By quickly identifying and resolving errors, you can minimize the impact on your users and improve their overall experience.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Sentry also provides performance monitoring capabilities, allowing you to identify and address performance bottlenecks in your application.
- **Collaboration:** Sentry facilitates collaboration between developers, allowing them to assign issues, track progress, and resolve errors more efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **A Sentry Account:** If you don't already have one, sign up for a free account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- **A Nuxt 3 Project:** This guide assumes you have a working Nuxt 3 project. If not, you can quickly create one using the Nuxt CLI:

  ```bash
  npx nuxi init my-nuxt-app
  cd my-nuxt-app
  ```

## Step 1: Install the Sentry SDK

The recommended way to integrate Sentry with your Nuxt 3 application is by using the `@sentry/vue` SDK. Install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @sentry/vue @sentry/tracing
# or
yarn add @sentry/vue @sentry/tracing
```

## Step 2: Configure Sentry in your Nuxt 3 App

Now, let's configure Sentry within our Nuxt 3 application. The best place to do this is within a Nuxt plugin to ensure it initializes on app startup.

Create a new file called `plugins/sentry.client.ts` (or `plugins/sentry.server.ts` for server-side error tracking, although the client-side is usually the priority):

```typescript
// plugins/sentry.client.ts

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/vue'
import { BrowserTracing } from '@sentry/tracing'
import { defineNuxtPlugin } from '#app'

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  const dsn = import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN // Use environment variable

  if (!dsn) {
    console.warn('Sentry DSN not found. Sentry is not initialized.')
    return
  }

  Sentry.init({
    app: nuxtApp.vueApp,
    dsn: dsn,
    integrations: [
      new BrowserTracing({
        tracePropagationTargets: ['localhost', /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/], // Update with your server URL(s)
        routingInstrumentation: Sentry.vueRouterInstrumentation(nuxtApp.$router),
      }),
    ],
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production
    tracesSampleRate: 0.2, // Adjust based on your needs (0.2 = 20% of transactions)
    replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // Adjust based on your needs (0.1 = 10% of sessions)
    replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // If you're not already sampling the entire session, change the sample rate to 100% when sampling sessions where errors occur.
    integrations: [new Sentry.Replay()],

    beforeSend(event) {
      // Modify the event before sending it to Sentry
      return event
    },

    // Release health
    release: 'your-app-name@' + process.env.npm_package_version,

    environment: import.meta.env.NODE_ENV, // Set the environment
  })

  nuxtApp.vueApp.config.errorHandler = (error, component, info) => {
    console.error(error)
    Sentry.captureException(error)
  }

  return {
    provide: {
      sentry: Sentry,
    },
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";`:** Imports the Sentry Vue SDK.
- **`import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";`:** Imports the BrowserTracing integration for performance monitoring.
- **`import { defineNuxtPlugin } from "#app";`:** Imports the `defineNuxtPlugin` function from Nuxt 3.
- **`const dsn = import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN;`:** Retrieves your Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) from an environment variable. **Important:** Never hardcode your DSN in your source code! Use environment variables. The prefix `VITE_` is important as it indicates a public variable that is available in the client-side.
- **`Sentry.init({...});`:** Initializes the Sentry SDK with your configuration options.
  - **`app: nuxtApp.vueApp`:** Passes your Vue app instance to Sentry.
  - **`dsn: dsn`:** Specifies your Sentry DSN.
  - **`integrations: [...]`:** Configures integrations, including `BrowserTracing` for performance monitoring. The `routingInstrumentation` property in BrowserTracing ensures that page transitions and route changes are automatically captured as performance spans. Remember to replace `https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api` with your actual server URL(s). This allows Sentry to track the performance of API requests.
  - **`tracesSampleRate: 0.2`:** Sets the percentage of transactions to sample for performance monitoring. Adjust as needed.
  - **`replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1`:** Specifies the percentage of sessions to record as replays. Useful for visually debugging user interactions.
  - **`replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0`:** Ensures that sessions with errors are always recorded as replays.
  - **`release: 'your-app-name@' + process.env.npm_package_version`:** Specifies the release version of your application. This is crucial for associating errors with specific deployments. Make sure to set the `npm_package_version` environment variable during your build process. You can name it whatever you like, but following this pattern is best practice.
  - **`environment: import.meta.env.NODE_ENV`:** Sets the environment (e.g., "development", "production"). Important for filtering errors in Sentry.
  - **`beforeSend(event) { ... }`:** An optional function that allows you to modify the error event before it's sent to Sentry. This can be useful for redacting sensitive information.
- **`nuxtApp.vueApp.config.errorHandler = (error, component, info) => { ... };`:** This is the most important part. This overrides the default Vue error handler. Any uncaught errors in your Vue components will be caught by this handler, logged to the console, and then sent to Sentry using `Sentry.captureException(error)`.
- **`return { provide: { sentry: Sentry } };`:** Provides the Sentry instance to your Nuxt 3 application, allowing you to access it using `$sentry`.

**`.client.ts` vs `.server.ts`**

The `.client.ts` and `.server.ts` suffixes are important. They tell Nuxt whether to include this plugin in the client-side or server-side bundle. In this case, we are using `.client.ts` because we want to capture errors that occur in the browser. You can create both for client-side and server-side error logging.

## Step 3: Set up Environment Variables

As mentioned earlier, you should never hardcode your Sentry DSN in your code. Instead, use an environment variable.

1.  **Get your Sentry DSN:** In your Sentry project settings, find your DSN (Client Keys). It will look something like this:

    ```
    https://YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY@sentry.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```

2.  **Set the environment variable:** Add the `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable to your `.env` file in the root of your Nuxt project (create the file if it doesn't exist).

    ```
    VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY@sentry.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```

    **Important:** Make sure to restart your Nuxt development server after adding or changing environment variables.

3.  **Ensure `process.env.npm_package_version` is set:** During your build or deploy process, make sure to set the `npm_package_version` environment variable. This can be done using your CI/CD system. For example, in a GitHub Actions workflow:

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build
        env:
          NODE_ENV: production
          npm_package_version: ${{ github.run_number }} # Example: use GitHub run number as version
        run: npm run build
    ```

## Step 4: Test your Sentry Integration

Now it's time to test your Sentry integration. A simple way to do this is to intentionally throw an error in one of your components.

For example, add the following code to a page component (e.g., `pages/index.vue`):

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to my Nuxt 3 App</h1>
    <button @click="triggerError">Throw Error</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const triggerError = () => {
  throw new Error("This is a test error sent to Sentry!");
};
</script>
```

When you click the "Throw Error" button, an error will be thrown, and Sentry should capture it.

**Alternative Test Method (More Robust):**

A better method is to use the `Sentry.captureException` method directly to ensure Sentry is initialized and working correctly. Modify your `pages/index.vue` like this:

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to my Nuxt 3 App</h1>
    <button @click="captureError">Capture Error</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

const captureError = () => {
  try {
    // Simulate an error
    throw new Error("This is a test error captured by Sentry!");
  } catch (error) {
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }
};
</script>
```

This approach uses a `try...catch` block to handle the error and then explicitly sends it to Sentry using `Sentry.captureException`. This is also how you would log handled exceptions in your application.

## Step 5: Verify Error in Sentry

Go to your Sentry dashboard. You should see the error you triggered in the "Issues" section. Click on the issue to view the details, including the stack trace, environment information, and user context.

## Additional Configuration Options and Best Practices

- **User Context:** Identify your users by setting the user context in Sentry. This allows you to track errors specific to individual users. You can set the user context using the `Sentry.setUser` method. For example, if you have user authentication:

  ```typescript
  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/vue'

  // Assuming you have user data available after login
  const user = {
    id: 123,
    email: 'user@example.com',
    username: 'johndoe',
  }

  Sentry.setUser(user)
  ```

- **Breadcrumbs:** Sentry captures breadcrumbs, which are a trail of events leading up to an error. You can add custom breadcrumbs to provide more context about user actions.

  ```typescript
  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/vue'

  Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
    category: 'navigation',
    message: 'User navigated to the home page',
    level: 'info',
  })
  ```

- **Tags:** Use tags to categorize and filter errors in Sentry. For example, you can tag errors based on the component they occurred in.

  ```typescript
  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/vue'

  Sentry.setTag('component', 'MyComponent')
  ```

- **Ignore Errors:** Sometimes, you might want to ignore certain errors that are not critical or are expected. You can use the `beforeSend` hook to filter out these errors.

  ```typescript
  Sentry.init({
    // ... other options
    beforeSend(event) {
      if (event.message === 'Ignored error') {
        return null // Drop the event
      }
      return event
    },
  })
  ```

- **Source Maps:** Upload source maps to Sentry to deobfuscate minified JavaScript code, making it easier to read stack traces. Nuxt 3 can automatically generate source maps during the build process. Refer to the Nuxt documentation for details on source map configuration. Sentry also provides tools to automatically upload your source maps.

- **Server-Side Error Tracking:** While this guide primarily focuses on client-side error tracking, you can also configure Sentry for server-side error logging using `plugins/sentry.server.ts`. This is useful for capturing errors that occur during server-side rendering or API calls. Remember to initialize Sentry with the server DSN and configure the necessary integrations for your server environment (e.g., Express, Koa).

- **Consider a Sentry Nuxt module:** In the future, keep an eye out for a dedicated Sentry Nuxt module. Modules can simplify the integration process and provide additional features specific to Nuxt. As of this writing, a stable first-party module doesn't exist, but community projects may be available.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sentry Not Initializing:** Double-check that your Sentry DSN is correctly set in your environment variables and that you are using the correct DSN for your environment (e.g., development, production). Also, ensure that your `plugins/sentry.client.ts` file is correctly placed in the `plugins` directory.
- **Errors Not Appearing in Sentry:** Verify that the `tracesSampleRate` and `replaysSessionSampleRate` are set to appropriate values. If these values are too low, you might not be capturing enough errors or sessions. Also, check your `beforeSend` hook to ensure that you are not inadvertently filtering out errors. Finally, check your browser's developer console for any errors related to Sentry.
- **CORS Issues:** If you are experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues, ensure that your server is configured to allow requests from Sentry. You may need to add Sentry's domains to your `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

## Conclusion

Integrating Sentry with your Nuxt 3 application is a valuable investment in the quality and reliability of your software. By following this guide, you can effectively track and monitor errors, improve debugging, and enhance the user experience. Remember to configure your Sentry integration carefully, using environment variables, setting user context, and adding breadcrumbs and tags to provide more context about errors. With Sentry, you can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact your users, ensuring a smooth and stable application experience.
