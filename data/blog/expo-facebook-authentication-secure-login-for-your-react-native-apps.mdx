# Expo Facebook Authentication: Secure Login for Your React Native Apps

Adding social login to your React Native app is a great way to improve user experience and boost engagement. Facebook authentication is a popular choice, offering a familiar and convenient way for users to sign up and log in. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to integrate Facebook authentication into your Expo React Native application using `expo-facebook`.

## Why Choose Facebook Authentication?

- **Increased User Conversion:** Reduces friction in the signup process, encouraging more users to create accounts.
- **Familiarity and Trust:** Users are already familiar with the Facebook login flow, increasing their trust and willingness to use it.
- **Reduced Password Fatigue:** Eliminates the need for users to create and remember another password.
- **Social Integration (Optional):** With user consent, you can leverage Facebook's social graph to enhance your app's features.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:** Essential for React Native development.
- **Expo CLI installed:** Install it globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`.
- **An Expo project initialized:** If you don't have one, create a new project using `expo init MyAwesomeApp`.
- **A Facebook Developer Account and App:** You'll need to create a Facebook app to enable authentication.

## Step 1: Create a Facebook App

1.  **Go to the Facebook Developer Portal:** Navigate to [https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/).
2.  **Create a New App:** Click on "My Apps" and then "Create App".
3.  **Select App Type:** Choose "Consumer" as the app type.
4.  **Enter App Details:** Provide a name for your app and your contact email.
5.  **Add Facebook Login Product:** Once your app is created, find "Facebook Login" in the "Add Products" section and click "Set Up".
6.  **Select Platform:** Choose "Web" as your platform. Enter `https://localhost:19006` as the site URL. This is essential for local development with Expo. You can also add your production URL here once you deploy your app.
7.  **Configure Settings:** Go to "Settings" -> "Basic" in the left sidebar.
    - **App Domains:** Enter your app's domain (e.g., `myapp.com`). For development, you might use a placeholder domain or `localhost`. It is important to define the domain correctly to avoid authentication errors.
    - **Privacy Policy URL:** Provide a link to your app's privacy policy.
    - **Terms of Service URL:** Provide a link to your app's terms of service.
    - **Category:** Select an appropriate category for your app.
    - **Data Deletion Instructions URL:** Provide URL with instructions for deleting user data.
    - **App Icon:** Upload an icon for your app.
    - **Save Changes:** Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the page.
8.  **Get Your App ID and App Secret:** You'll find your App ID and App Secret on the "Settings" -> "Basic" page. Keep these values safe!
9.  **Set App to Live:** In "App Review" -> "Permissions and Features", click "Request Advanced Access" for the `public_profile` permission. You'll need to submit your app for review when you're ready to launch to production. Until then, keep the app in development mode to test. Make the app live when you are ready for production.
10. **Enable Client OAuth Login**: Navigate to Products -> Facebook Login -> Settings. Ensure "Client OAuth Login" and "Web OAuth Login" are enabled. Add your valid OAuth redirect URIs, for local development with expo you can use `https://localhost:19006`.

## Step 2: Install the `expo-facebook` Package

Open your project in your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-facebook
```

This command installs the `expo-facebook` package and its dependencies.

## Step 3: Implement the Facebook Login Logic

Now, let's write the code to handle the Facebook login process.

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native'
import * as Facebook from 'expo-facebook'

export default function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)

  const handleFacebookLogin = async () => {
    try {
      await Facebook.initializeAsync({
        appId: '<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID>', // Replace with your Facebook App ID
      })
      const { type, token, expirationDate, permissions, declinedPermissions } =
        await Facebook.logInWithReadPermissionsAsync({
          permissions: ['public_profile', 'email'], // Request user's profile and email
        })
      if (type === 'success') {
        // Get the user's data
        const response = await fetch(
          `https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=${token}&fields=id,name,email,picture.type(large)`
        )
        const profile = await response.json()
        console.log('Facebook profile data:', profile)
        setUser(profile)
        Alert.alert('Logged in!', `Hi ${profile.name}!`)
        // Here you would typically send the token to your backend for authentication
      } else {
        // type === 'cancel'
        Alert.alert('Login canceled!')
      }
    } catch ({ message }) {
      Alert.alert(`Facebook Login Error: ${message}`)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {user ? (
        <View>
          <Text>Logged in as: {user.name}</Text>
          {user.picture && user.picture.data && user.picture.data.url && (
            <Image
              source={{ uri: user.picture.data.url }}
              style={{ width: 100, height: 100, borderRadius: 50 }}
            />
          )}
        </View>
      ) : (
        <Button title="Login with Facebook" onPress={handleFacebookLogin} />
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** Imports `React`, `useState`, `StyleSheet`, `Text`, `View`, `Button`, `Alert` and `expo-facebook`.
2.  **Initialize Facebook SDK:** Inside the `handleFacebookLogin` function, we initialize the Facebook SDK using `Facebook.initializeAsync({ appId: '<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID>' })`. **Replace `<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID>` with your actual Facebook App ID.**
3.  **Request Permissions:** `Facebook.logInWithReadPermissionsAsync()` prompts the user to log in and grant permissions to your app. We're requesting `public_profile` and `email` in this example. You can request other permissions as needed.
4.  **Handle Login Result:**
    - **Success:** If the login is successful (`type === 'success'`), we retrieve the user's access token and use it to fetch their profile data from the Facebook Graph API.
    - **Cancel:** If the user cancels the login (`type === 'cancel'`), we display an alert.
    - **Error:** If an error occurs during the login process, we display an alert with the error message.
5.  **Fetch User Data:** We make a request to the Facebook Graph API to retrieve the user's `id`, `name`, `email`, and `picture`.
6.  **Update State:** We update the `user` state with the retrieved profile data. This triggers a re-render of the component, displaying the user's name.
7.  **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during the login process.
8.  **UI Display:** If a user is logged in the app displays the user name and profile image. Otherwise it will render a login button which triggers the Facebook login.

## Step 4: Configure `app.json`

Add the following to your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file. This is necessary for Expo to correctly configure the Facebook integration for both iOS and Android.

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    // ... other configurations
    "facebookScheme": "fb<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID>", // iOS-specific
    "facebookAppId": "<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID>",
    "facebookDisplayName": "<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_NAME>"
  }
}
```

**Replace:**

- `<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID>` with your Facebook App ID.
- `<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_NAME>` with your Facebook App Name.

**Important notes:**

- The `facebookScheme` is crucial for iOS. It's a URL scheme that allows Facebook to redirect back to your app after the user logs in. It must start with `fb` followed by your Facebook App ID.
- `facebookAppId` is used by the Expo SDK.
- `facebookDisplayName` is used by Expo to set the default Facebook display name if one isn't already configured on the app.

## Step 5: Test on a Real Device (or Simulator)

Facebook authentication requires a real device (or simulator) to function correctly. Expo Go on a browser won't work.

1.  **Expo Go App:** Make sure you have the Expo Go app installed on your phone. If using a simulator, ensure you simulator is setup with an active apple ID.
2.  **Expo Start:** Run `expo start` in your project directory.
3.  **Scan the QR Code:** Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your device.

Now, tap the "Login with Facebook" button. You should be redirected to the Facebook login screen. After logging in and granting permissions, you'll be redirected back to your app, and you should see your Facebook profile name displayed.

## Step 6: Handling the Access Token

The `token` you receive after successful login is an **access token**. This token is essential for making API calls to the Facebook Graph API on behalf of the user. Typically, you would send this token to your backend server.

**Backend Authentication:**

On your backend, you should verify the access token with Facebook to ensure its validity and authenticity. You can use Facebook's SDKs or make API calls directly to the Graph API.

**Example (Node.js using `node-fetch`):**

```plaintext
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

async function verifyFacebookToken(accessToken) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://graph.facebook.com/debug_token?input_token=${accessToken}&access_token=${process.env.FACEBOOK_APP_ID}|${process.env.FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET}`
  )
  const data = await response.json()

  if (data.data.is_valid) {
    // Token is valid
    const userId = data.data.user_id
    return userId // Return the user's Facebook ID
  } else {
    // Token is invalid
    throw new Error('Invalid Facebook token')
  }
}
```

**Important considerations:**

- **Store the User ID:** On your backend, you would typically associate the Facebook user ID with a user in your own database. Don't store the access token directly unless absolutely necessary, and if you do, handle it with the utmost security.
- **Access Token Expiration:** Access tokens have an expiration time. You'll need to handle token refresh or prompt the user to re-authenticate when the token expires. The `expirationDate` value returned by `Facebook.logInWithReadPermissionsAsync()` indicates when the token expires.
- **Revoking Permissions:** Users can revoke permissions granted to your app at any time in their Facebook settings. You should gracefully handle this scenario and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

## Best Practices

- **Request Minimal Permissions:** Only request the permissions you absolutely need. This increases user trust and reduces the likelihood of users declining permissions.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement proper error handling to provide a smooth and informative user experience. Display meaningful error messages to guide users.
- **Securely Store and Manage Access Tokens:** Protect access tokens and user data with appropriate security measures.
- **Respect User Privacy:** Adhere to Facebook's Platform Policies and respect user privacy. Clearly explain how you will use the data you collect.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your Facebook authentication integration on both iOS and Android devices, including simulators and real devices.
- **Implement Token Refresh:** Implement a mechanism to refresh the user's access token when it expires, ideally using a refresh token flow to avoid repeatedly prompting the user to log in. This feature can vary, so explore possible backend implementations to refresh tokens from Facebook.
- **Use a Secure Backend:** A secure backend that can verify the access token is recommended to make sure only valid users have access to data.
- **Use SSL (HTTPS):** Ensure that your app and backend communicate over HTTPS to protect sensitive data, including access tokens.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid App ID" Error:** Double-check that you've entered the correct Facebook App ID in your code and `app.json`.
- **"Invalid Key Hash" Error (Android):** This error indicates that the key hash used to sign your Android app does not match the key hash configured in your Facebook App settings. Follow Facebook's documentation to generate and add the correct key hash.
- **"URL Blocked: This redirect failed because the redirect URI is not whitelisted in the app’s Client OAuth Settings."** Make sure your redirect URI (usually `https://localhost:19006` for development with Expo) is added to the valid OAuth redirect URIs under Facebook Login -> Settings.

## Conclusion

Integrating Facebook authentication into your Expo React Native app can significantly enhance user experience and streamline the login process. By following this guide and adhering to best practices, you can implement a secure and reliable Facebook login integration. Remember to always prioritize user privacy and security when handling sensitive data like access tokens.
