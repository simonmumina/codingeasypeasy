# Mastering Navigation with Expo Router: A Comprehensive Guide

Expo Router is a powerful, file-system-based router designed to simplify navigation in your React Native applications built with Expo.  It streamlines the process of creating and managing routes, allowing you to focus on building compelling user interfaces.  This comprehensive guide will walk you through the core concepts of Expo Router, from basic setup to advanced features like dynamic routes and deep linking.

## Why Expo Router?

Expo Router offers several advantages over traditional React Native navigation libraries:

*   **File-Based Routing:** Define your routes by creating files and folders, mirroring your application's structure. This makes your navigation intuitive and easy to understand.
*   **Automatic Linking:** Expo Router automatically handles linking between screens, reducing boilerplate code.
*   **Deep Linking Support:** Seamlessly integrate deep linking to navigate users directly to specific parts of your application from external links.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Built with performance in mind, Expo Router ensures smooth transitions and a responsive user experience.
*   **Type Safety (with TypeScript):**  Expo Router is designed to work seamlessly with TypeScript, providing type safety and improved developer experience.
*   **Built-in Header Navigation:**  Easily configure header bars without external libraries.

## Getting Started with Expo Router

Before we dive in, make sure you have a recent version of Expo CLI installed:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then, create a new Expo project using the `tabs` template, which comes pre-configured with Expo Router:

```bash
expo init my-app --template tabs
cd my-app
```

This command initializes a new project with a basic tab-based navigation structure using Expo Router.  If you are adding Expo Router to an existing project, you will need to install the required packages:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context expo-router
```

And then update your `metro.config.js`:

```javascript
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname, {
  // [Web build]: Babel throws error when importing react-native-web.
  isTSBundler: true,
  unstable_enableSymlinks: true,
  unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
});

config.resolver.sourceExts.push('cjs');

module.exports = config;
```

## Understanding the File Structure

Expo Router uses a file-system-based routing convention. Here's how it works:

*   **`app` Directory:**  All your route files reside within the `app` directory.
*   **`index.js` or `index.tsx`:** Represents the root route (usually your home screen).
*   **File Name as Route:**  Each file in the `app` directory becomes a route. For example, `app/settings.js` creates a route `/settings`.
*   **Folder Name as Route Segment:**  Folders create nested route segments. For example, `app/profile/edit.js` creates a route `/profile/edit`.
*   **`_layout.js` or `_layout.tsx`:** Defines a layout that wraps the components in the same directory and any subdirectories.  This is useful for creating shared headers, footers, or navigation menus.

Let's examine a typical `app` directory structure:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.js         // Root layout
│   ├── index.js           // Home screen (route: /)
│   ├── about.js           // About screen (route: /about)
│   ├── users/
│   │   ├── _layout.js     // Layout for users section
│   │   ├── index.js       // Users list (route: /users)
│   │   ├── [id].js         // Dynamic route for user details (route: /users/:id)
│   └── _layout.js         // Tab navigation layout for the whole app
```

## Basic Navigation

Navigating between screens is straightforward using the `useRouter` hook provided by Expo Router.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to About"
        onPress={() => router.push('/about')}
      />
       <Button
        title="Go to Users"
        onPress={() => router.push('/users')}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`useRouter()`:** This hook provides access to the routing functionalities.
*   **`router.push(path)`:**  Navigates to the specified path, adding it to the navigation history (like a regular link).  You can use absolute paths (e.g., `/about`) or relative paths (e.g., `./about`).  Using relative paths is generally preferred.
*   **`router.replace(path)`:**  Replaces the current route in the navigation history with the specified path.  This is useful when you don't want the user to be able to navigate back to the previous screen.
*   **`router.back()`:** Navigates back to the previous screen in the navigation history.

## Programmatic Navigation

You can also navigate programmatically based on conditions or events within your application.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function AuthCheck() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const isLoggedIn = false; // Replace with your actual authentication logic

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isLoggedIn) {
      router.replace('/login'); // Redirect to login if not authenticated
    }
  }, [isLoggedIn, router]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Checking Authentication...</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `AuthCheck` component checks if the user is logged in. If not, it redirects them to the `/login` screen using `router.replace()`.

## Dynamic Routes

Expo Router makes it easy to create dynamic routes that can accept parameters.  This is useful for displaying details based on an ID, such as user profiles or product pages.

To create a dynamic route, use square brackets `[]` in the file name.  For example, `app/users/[id].js` creates a dynamic route `/users/:id`.

```javascript
// app/users/[id].js
import { useRouter, useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function UserDetails() {
  const { id } = useLocalSearchParams(); // Access route parameters
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>User ID: {id}</Text>
      {/* Fetch and display user data based on the ID */}
      <Button
        title="Go Back"
        onPress={() => router.back()}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`useLocalSearchParams()`:** This hook returns an object containing the route parameters.  In this case, it will contain the `id` parameter.
*   The `id` is accessed from `useLocalSearchParams()` and used to display or fetch data related to that specific user.

To navigate to this dynamic route:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default function UsersScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Users Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="View User 123"
        onPress={() => router.push('/users/123')}
      />
       <Button
        title="View User 456"
        onPress={() => router.push('/users/456')}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Passing Parameters Between Routes

You can pass parameters between routes using the `router.push()` or `router.replace()` method with a query string or by using the state object within the navigation.

**Using Query Strings:**

```javascript
// Navigate with a query string
router.push(`/search?query=${searchTerm}`);

// Access the query parameter in the destination component
const { query } = useLocalSearchParams();
```

**Using State Objects:**

```javascript
// Pass a state object
router.push({ pathname: '/profile', params: { name: 'John', age: 30 } });

// Access the state object in the destination component
const { name, age } = useLocalSearchParams(); // Also accessed via `useLocalSearchParams()`
```

## Layout Routes (`_layout.js` or `_layout.tsx`)

Layout routes are a crucial feature of Expo Router.  They allow you to define shared UI elements, such as headers, footers, or navigation menus, that are applied to multiple screens within a directory and its subdirectories.

Create a `_layout.js` or `_layout.tsx` file in the directory where you want to apply the layout.

```javascript
// app/_layout.js
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen
        name="index"
        options={{
          title: 'Home',
        }}
      />
      <Stack.Screen
        name="about"
        options={{
          title: 'About',
        }}
      />
       <Stack.Screen
        name="users"
        options={{
          title: 'Users',
        }}
      />
       <Stack.Screen
        name="users/[id]"
        options={{
          title: 'User Details',
        }}
      />
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`<Stack>`:**  This component provides stack-based navigation. Each `<Stack.Screen>` defines a screen within the stack and its corresponding options.
*   **`options` prop:** This prop allows you to configure various aspects of the screen, such as the title in the header.

**Important Considerations for `_layout.js` and `_layout.tsx`:**

* **Order Matters:**  The `_layout.js` files are processed from the root of your `app` directory down to the specific route being rendered. The outer layouts wrap the inner layouts. This allows you to create nested layouts with shared elements and screen specific configurations.
* **Root Layout:**  A root layout (`app/_layout.js` or `app/_layout.tsx`) is essential for wrapping the entire app with a navigation container.
* **Tab Navigation:**  Expo Router also supports tab-based navigation.  You can use the `<Tabs>` component within a layout to create a tab bar at the bottom of the screen.

## Deep Linking

Deep linking allows you to navigate users directly to specific parts of your application from external links.  Expo Router seamlessly integrates with Expo's deep linking capabilities.

To configure deep linking:

1.  **Configure `app.json`:**  Add a `scheme` to your `app.json` file.  This scheme will be used as the base for your deep links.

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "my-app",
        "slug": "my-app",
        "scheme": "myapp",
        // ... other configurations
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Create Deep Links:**  You can now create deep links using your scheme and the route path.  For example, `myapp://users/123` will navigate the user to the `/users/123` route.

3. **Handle Incoming Links:** Expo Router automatically handles incoming links based on your file system routing. When the app receives a link with the configured scheme, Expo Router automatically navigates to corresponding screen.

```javascript
// Example of handling the link
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';

export default function DeepLinkHandler() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    const linkingSubscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
      const url = event.url;
      if (url) {
        const href = url.replace(/.*?:\/\//g, ''); //Remove scheme
        router.push('/' + href); //Push to the location
      }
    });
    return () => Linking.removeEventListener('url', linkingSubscription);
  }, [router]);

  return null;
}
```

Add the `<DeepLinkHandler/>` to the `_layout.js` or `_layout.tsx` which wraps the navigation.

## Advanced Features

*   **Headless Navigation:** Perform navigation without rendering a screen (e.g., for background tasks).
*   **Custom Transition Animations:**  Customize the transition animations between screens.
*   **Authentication Flow:** Implement a complete authentication flow with login, registration, and protected routes.
*   **TypeScript Integration:** Leverage the benefits of TypeScript for type-safe navigation. Expo Router integrates well with Typescript.
