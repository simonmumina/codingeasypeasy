# How to Enable or Disable Windows Features via CMD: DISM Command Guide

Windows features are optional components of the operating system that provide additional functionality, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), .NET Framework, and Hyper-V. While the graphical interface allows you to easily manage these features through the "Turn Windows features on or off" dialog, the command line offers a more powerful and automated way to control them.  This guide will walk you through using the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool via the Command Prompt (CMD) to enable or disable Windows features.

## Why Use DISM to Manage Windows Features?

There are several advantages to using DISM via CMD for managing Windows features:

*   **Automation:**  You can script the process to enable or disable features across multiple machines, saving time and ensuring consistency.
*   **Remote Management:**  You can remotely manage features on other computers using PowerShell with DISM.
*   **Troubleshooting:**  Sometimes, enabling or disabling features through the GUI may fail. DISM can provide more detailed error messages, aiding in troubleshooting.
*   **Precise Control:**  DISM offers granular control over feature dependencies and installation options.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Administrator Privileges:** You need administrator privileges to run DISM commands. Open CMD as administrator by right-clicking on the Command Prompt icon and selecting "Run as administrator."
*   **Windows Installation Media (Optional):** In some cases, you may need access to the Windows installation media (ISO or DVD) if the required feature files are not available on your system.

## Understanding the DISM Command

The core command for managing Windows features is:

```
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:<FeatureName> [/all] [/source:<SourcePath>] [/limitaccess]
dism /online /disable-feature /featurename:<FeatureName> [/remove]
```

Let's break down each part:

*   **`dism`**:  Invokes the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool.
*   **`/online`**: Specifies that the DISM command should target the currently running operating system.
*   **`/enable-feature`**:  Indicates that you want to enable a specific feature.
*   **`/disable-feature`**: Indicates that you want to disable a specific feature.
*   **`/featurename:<FeatureName>`**:  Specifies the name of the feature you want to enable or disable.  You need to replace `<FeatureName>` with the actual name of the feature.  We'll cover how to find the correct feature name later.
*   **`/all`**:  (Optional, only applicable with `/enable-feature`) Enables all parent features and any dependencies of the specified feature. This is often recommended to ensure all required components are installed.
*   **`/source:<SourcePath>`**: (Optional, only applicable with `/enable-feature`) Specifies the location of the feature files. This is needed if the required files are not available on your system (e.g., the feature files are on the Windows installation media).  Replace `<SourcePath>` with the path to the source files.
*   **`/limitaccess`**: (Optional, only applicable with `/enable-feature`) Prevents DISM from contacting Windows Update for feature installation. This can be useful if you want to install features only from a local source.
*   **`/remove`**: (Optional, only applicable with `/disable-feature`) Completely removes the feature files from the system.  Without this parameter, the feature will be disabled but the files will remain.  Use with caution as it might impact future upgrades.

## Finding the Feature Name

Before you can enable or disable a feature, you need to know its exact feature name.  You can use the following DISM command to list all available features on your system:

```
dism /online /get-features
```

This command will output a list of features, along with their current state (Enabled or Disabled).  Carefully examine the list to find the feature you're interested in and note its **Feature Name**.  Feature names are case-sensitive.

**Example Output:**

```
Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.19041.1

Image Version: 10.0.19041.1

Features listing:

Feature Name : IIS-WebServerRole
State : Disabled

Feature Name : IIS-WebServer
State : Disabled

Feature Name : NetFx3
State : Disabled

Feature Name : Microsoft-Hyper-V
State : Disabled

Feature Name : Containers-OptionalFeature
State : Disabled

The operation completed successfully.
```

## Enabling a Windows Feature

Let's say you want to enable Internet Information Services (IIS), which has the feature name `IIS-WebServerRole`.  You would use the following command:

```
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-WebServerRole /all
```

This command will enable the `IIS-WebServerRole` feature and all its dependencies.  If the feature files are not found on your system, you may need to specify the `/source` parameter with the path to the Windows installation media:

```
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-WebServerRole /all /source:D:\sources\sxs /limitaccess
```

In this example, `D:\sources\sxs` is the path to the `sxs` folder on the Windows installation media. The `/limitaccess` parameter is used to prevent DISM from trying to download the files from Windows Update.  Remember to replace `D:\sources\sxs` with the correct path for your media.

## Disabling a Windows Feature

To disable a Windows feature, use the `/disable-feature` switch.  For example, to disable IIS, you would use the following command:

```
dism /online /disable-feature /featurename:IIS-WebServerRole
```

This command will disable the `IIS-WebServerRole` feature, but the files will remain on your system.  To completely remove the feature files, use the `/remove` parameter:

```
dism /online /disable-feature /featurename:IIS-WebServerRole /remove
```

**Warning:** Using the `/remove` parameter is irreversible and might affect system stability if the feature is required by other components.

## Examples

Here are some more examples:

*   **Enabling .NET Framework 3.5:**

    ```
    dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFx3 /all /source:D:\sources\sxs /limitaccess
    ```

*   **Enabling Hyper-V:**

    ```
    dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V /all
    ```

*   **Disabling the Containers Optional Feature:**

    ```
    dism /online /disable-feature /featurename:Containers-OptionalFeature
    ```

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

*   **Error: "Error: 0x800f081f" or "The source files could not be found."**  This usually means the required feature files are not available on your system and you need to specify the `/source` parameter with the path to the Windows installation media. Make sure the path is correct and the media is accessible.

*   **Error: "Error: 0x800f0906" or "Could not load or find the language specific resource"**: This is often related to language packs. Try running `dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth` before attempting to enable the feature again. You might also need to ensure the language pack for the feature is installed.

*   **The command appears to hang:**  This can happen if DISM is waiting for user input or encountering a network issue.  Check your network connection and ensure that no other processes are interfering with DISM. You can also try restarting your computer.

*   **"Feature name is unknown"**:  Double-check the feature name you're using with the output from `dism /online /get-features`.  Feature names are case-sensitive and must be entered exactly as shown.

## Conclusion

Using the DISM command-line tool offers a powerful and flexible way to manage Windows features. By understanding the command syntax and options, you can automate feature installation and removal, troubleshoot problems, and gain more control over your Windows environment. Remember to always run CMD as administrator and to double-check feature names before executing any commands.  With a little practice, you can confidently manage Windows features using the command line.
