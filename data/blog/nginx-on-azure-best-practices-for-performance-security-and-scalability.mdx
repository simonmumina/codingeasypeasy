# NGINX on Azure: Best Practices for Performance, Security, and Scalability

NGINX is a powerful open-source web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. When combined with the robust infrastructure of Microsoft Azure, it provides a potent solution for hosting and delivering web applications with high performance, security, and scalability. This guide explores best practices for deploying and configuring NGINX on Azure, focusing on optimizing its functionality across different Azure services.

## Why Use NGINX on Azure?

- **Performance:** NGINX excels at handling concurrent connections and serving static content efficiently. It reduces the load on your backend servers, resulting in faster response times for users.
- **Security:** NGINX acts as a security layer, protecting your backend servers from direct exposure to the internet. It can be configured with features like SSL/TLS termination, rate limiting, and web application firewall (WAF) integration.
- **Scalability:** NGINX enables horizontal scaling by distributing traffic across multiple backend servers. This ensures that your application can handle increased traffic loads without performance degradation.
- **Flexibility:** NGINX offers a wide range of configuration options, allowing you to customize its behavior to meet the specific needs of your application.
- **Cost Efficiency:** By optimizing resource utilization and reducing the load on your backend servers, NGINX can contribute to lower infrastructure costs.

## Deploying NGINX on Azure: Options

There are several ways to deploy NGINX on Azure, each with its own advantages and considerations:

- **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):** Provides the most control over the NGINX configuration and allows for customization tailored to your specific needs.
- **Azure App Service:** Offers a managed platform for deploying web applications, but may require more effort to configure NGINX as a reverse proxy. Reverse proxy functionality may be limited in some App Service plans.
- **Azure Marketplace Solutions:** Pre-configured NGINX solutions are available in the Azure Marketplace, simplifying the deployment process.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Enables containerized deployments of NGINX as an ingress controller, providing a highly scalable and resilient solution.

## Best Practices for NGINX on Azure VMs

Deploying NGINX on Azure VMs gives you the most control and flexibility. Here's how to optimize your setup:

### 1. Choose the Right VM Size and Operating System

- **VM Size:** Select a VM size that is appropriate for your expected traffic volume and the resources required by NGINX. Consider using VMs with optimized network performance and sufficient CPU and memory. Azure's `Dsv3` and `Esv3` series are often good choices for general-purpose workloads.
- **Operating System:** Choose a Linux distribution known for its stability and security. Popular options include Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian. Ensure the OS is regularly patched for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Install and Configure NGINX

```plaintext
# Example for Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

# Example for CentOS
sudo yum update
sudo yum install nginx
```

After installation, configure NGINX to serve your application. Here's a basic example configuration file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/your-app`):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

    root /var/www/your-app;
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

Create a symbolic link to enable the site:

```plaintext
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t # Test the configuration
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 3. Enable SSL/TLS

Secure your NGINX server with SSL/TLS using Let's Encrypt:

```plaintext
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx  # Ubuntu
sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-nginx # CentOS

sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com -d www.your-domain.com
```

Certbot will automatically configure NGINX to use SSL/TLS and set up automatic certificate renewal. It will also configure redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. The NGINX configuration will be updated to include lines similar to these:

```nginx
listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
```

### 4. Configure Load Balancing

To distribute traffic across multiple backend servers, configure NGINX as a load balancer:

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com:8080;
    server backend2.example.com:8080;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

This configuration forwards requests to the `backend` upstream group, which consists of two backend servers. `proxy_set_header` directives ensure that the backend servers receive the correct client information.

### 5. Implement Caching

Enable caching to improve performance by storing frequently accessed content in NGINX's cache:

```nginx
proxy_cache_path /tmp/nginx_cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m max_size=10g inactive=60m use_temp_path=off;
proxy_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_cache my_cache;
        proxy_cache_valid 200 302 1h; # Cache for 1 hour for successful responses
        proxy_cache_valid 404 10m;  # Cache for 10 minutes for 404 errors
        proxy_cache_use_stale error timeout updating invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
        add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
    }
}
```

This configuration defines a cache zone named `my_cache`, sets the cache size to 10GB, and caches successful responses for 1 hour. The `X-Cache-Status` header allows you to monitor the cache's effectiveness.

### 6. Optimize NGINX Configuration

- **Worker Processes:** Adjust the number of worker processes based on the number of CPU cores available. Setting it to `auto` usually works well: `worker_processes auto;`
- **Worker Connections:** Increase the number of worker connections to handle more concurrent connections. Start with `worker_connections 1024;` and increase as needed.
- **Keep-Alive Connections:** Enable keep-alive connections to reuse existing connections and reduce latency: `keepalive_timeout 65;`
- **Gzip Compression:** Enable Gzip compression to reduce the size of HTTP responses:

  ```nginx
  gzip on;
  gzip_disable "msie6";
  gzip_vary on;
  gzip_proxied any;
  gzip_comp_level 6;
  gzip_buffers 16 8k;
  gzip_http_version 1.1;
  gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss image/svg+xml;
  ```

### 7. Secure NGINX

- **Regular Updates:** Keep NGINX updated to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Firewall:** Configure the Azure Network Security Group (NSG) to allow only necessary traffic to the NGINX VM. Typically, you'll want to allow inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
- **Disable Unnecessary Modules:** Disable any NGINX modules that are not required to reduce the attack surface.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks:

  ```nginx
  limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=1r/s;

  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name your-domain.com www.your-domain.com;

      location / {
          limit_req zone=mylimit burst=5 nodelay;
          proxy_pass http://backend;
          # ... other proxy settings ...
      }
  }
  ```

  This configuration limits requests from a single IP address to 1 request per second, with a burst of 5 requests.

### 8. Monitoring and Logging

- **Enable Logging:** Configure NGINX to log access and error events. The default locations are `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.
- **Monitor Performance:** Use Azure Monitor to track NGINX's performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.
- **Log Analysis:** Utilize Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics) or other log analysis tools to analyze NGINX logs and identify potential issues.

## NGINX on Azure App Service

Using NGINX with Azure App Service can be trickier, as you have less direct control over the server configuration. Here's how you can leverage NGINX's capabilities:

### 1. Use App Service as a Backend for NGINX on a VM

The recommended approach is to deploy NGINX on a separate Azure VM and configure it to forward requests to your App Service. This provides the most flexibility and control over NGINX's configuration. Follow the load balancing steps outlined in the "NGINX on Azure VMs" section, pointing the `backend` upstream to the App Service's hostname.

### 2. Custom Domains and SSL/TLS

Configure your custom domain and SSL/TLS certificate directly on the App Service. While you could theoretically handle SSL/TLS termination on the NGINX VM, it's generally easier and more manageable to let App Service handle it, especially when considering certificate renewal.

### 3. Use Built-in Features

Leverage App Service's built-in features like autoscaling, deployment slots, and managed identities. NGINX on the VM acts as a front-end to improve performance and security, while App Service handles the core application logic and deployment.

### 4. Consider a Reverse Proxy within the App Service (Advanced)

It _is_ possible to configure a reverse proxy _within_ an App Service application using tools like `http-proxy` in Node.js or similar libraries in other languages. However, this is generally _not_ recommended due to the limitations of the App Service environment and potential performance bottlenecks. It's almost always better to use a dedicated NGINX instance on a VM.

## Azure Marketplace Solutions

Azure Marketplace offers pre-configured NGINX solutions that simplify deployment and management. These solutions often include features like:

- Automated deployment and configuration
- Load balancing
- SSL/TLS termination
- Caching
- Web application firewall (WAF) integration

Search the Azure Marketplace for "NGINX" to find available solutions and choose one that meets your specific requirements. Be sure to review the solution's documentation and pricing before deploying.

## NGINX on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

NGINX Ingress Controller is a popular choice for managing external access to applications running in AKS. It uses NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer to route traffic to the appropriate services within the cluster.

### 1. Deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller

You can deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller using Helm or the Azure CLI.

**Using Helm:**

```plaintext
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm install my-nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
```

**Using Azure CLI:**

```plaintext
az aks enable-addons --addons ingress-appgw --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

### 2. Configure Ingress Resources

Define Ingress resources to route traffic to your services based on hostnames and paths:

```plaintext
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
    - host: your-domain.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

This Ingress resource routes traffic to `your-domain.com` to the `my-service` service on port 80. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation rewrites the request URI to `/` before forwarding it to the service.

### 3. SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt

You can use Cert-Manager to automatically provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates for your Ingress resources:

```plaintext
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --version v1.12.0 --set installCRDs=true
```

Then, create a ClusterIssuer and Certificate resource to request a certificate from Let's Encrypt.
