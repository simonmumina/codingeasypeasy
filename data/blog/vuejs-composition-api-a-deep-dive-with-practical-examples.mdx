# Vue.js Composition API: A Deep Dive with Practical Examples

The Vue.js Composition API is a powerful alternative to the Options API that has become increasingly popular for building complex Vue applications. It offers a more flexible and organized way to structure your component logic, making it easier to reuse code, maintain large projects, and collaborate with other developers. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the Composition API, explaining its core concepts and providing practical examples to help you master it.

## What is the Vue.js Composition API?

The Composition API is a set of functions that allows us to organize the logic of our Vue components in a more modular and reusable way.  Instead of defining component logic through properties like `data`, `methods`, `computed`, and `watch` (as in the Options API), we can use functions to define and group related logic together. This approach promotes better code organization, reusability, and testability.

**Key benefits of using the Composition API:**

*   **Improved Code Organization:** The Composition API allows you to group related logic together, making your code easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Enhanced Reusability:**  You can extract reusable logic into composable functions, which can be easily shared across multiple components.
*   **Better Type Inference:** TypeScript integrates seamlessly with the Composition API, providing excellent type safety and improved developer experience.
*   **Reduced Complexity:** By breaking down complex components into smaller, manageable functions, the Composition API helps reduce overall complexity.
*   **Improved Testability:** Composable functions are easier to test in isolation compared to methods defined within the Options API.

## Core Concepts of the Composition API

At the heart of the Composition API lies the `setup()` function, which serves as the entry point for composing your component's logic. Here are the fundamental concepts:

1.  **The `setup()` Function:**  This function is executed *before* the component is created.  It receives two arguments:
    *   `props`: The component's props.  Note that when using TypeScript, these props are strongly typed.
    *   `context`:  An object containing useful properties like `emit` (for emitting custom events), `attrs` (for accessing non-prop attributes), and `slots` (for accessing slots).

    The `setup()` function must return an object.  The properties of this object will be available to the component's template. These properties can be reactive data, computed properties, methods, or any other value you want to expose.

2.  **Reactive Data with `ref` and `reactive`:**

    *   **`ref()`:**  Used to create reactive variables that hold primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans) or complex objects. Changes to the `value` property of a `ref` trigger updates in the component's template.
    *   **`reactive()`:**  Used to create reactive objects. Any changes to the properties of a reactive object will trigger updates in the component's template.
    *   **Choosing between `ref` and `reactive`:** Use `ref` for single, individual values or when you need to reassign the variable to a new value. Use `reactive` when you have multiple related properties that you want to group together into a reactive object.

3.  **Computed Properties with `computed()`:** `computed()` creates a read-only reactive value that is derived from other reactive values. The computed property will automatically update whenever its dependencies change.

4.  **Watchers with `watch()` and `watchEffect()`:** Watchers allow you to react to changes in reactive data.

    *   **`watch()`:**  Allows you to specifically watch one or more reactive sources (refs, reactive objects, or getter functions) and execute a callback function when they change.
    *   **`watchEffect()`:**  Automatically tracks the reactive dependencies used within the callback function and re-runs the callback whenever any of those dependencies change. Use `watchEffect` for side effects that should be triggered whenever the underlying reactive dependencies change.

## Practical Examples

Let's illustrate the Composition API with several practical examples:

### Example 1: A Simple Counter Component

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0); // Create a reactive variable

    const increment = () => {
      count.value++; // Access the value through .value
    };

    return {
      count,
      increment,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We import the `ref` function from Vue.
*   Inside the `setup()` function, we create a reactive variable `count` using `ref(0)`. This initializes the count to 0.
*   The `increment` function increments the `count.value`.
*   We return an object containing `count` and `increment`, making them available in the template.  Note that we expose `count` without the `.value` suffix; Vue automatically unwraps refs in the template.

### Example 2:  A Todo List Component

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <input v-model="newTodo" @keyup.enter="addTodo" placeholder="Add a todo" />
    <ul>
      <li v-for="(todo, index) in todos" :key="index">
        {{ todo }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const todos = ref([]);
    const newTodo = ref('');

    const addTodo = () => {
      if (newTodo.value.trim() !== '') {
        todos.value.push(newTodo.value.trim());
        newTodo.value = '';
      }
    };

    return {
      todos,
      newTodo,
      addTodo,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use `ref` to create reactive variables for the `todos` array and the `newTodo` input field.
*   The `addTodo` function adds a new todo to the `todos` array when the user presses Enter in the input field.

### Example 3: Using `reactive` for a User Profile

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Name: {{ user.firstName }} {{ user.lastName }}</p>
    <p>Email: {{ user.email }}</p>
    <button @click="updateEmail">Update Email</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { reactive } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const user = reactive({
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    });

    const updateEmail = () => {
      user.email = 'new.email@example.com';
    };

    return {
      user,
      updateEmail,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use `reactive` to create a reactive object for the user profile.
*   Changes to the `user` object's properties will automatically trigger updates in the template.

### Example 4: Using `computed` for a Full Name

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Full Name: {{ fullName }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const firstName = ref('John');
    const lastName = ref('Doe');

    const fullName = computed(() => {
      return `${firstName.value} ${lastName.value}`;
    });

    return {
      firstName,
      lastName,
      fullName,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use `computed` to create a derived value `fullName` based on the `firstName` and `lastName` refs.
*   Whenever `firstName` or `lastName` changes, the `fullName` computed property will automatically update.

### Example 5: Using `watch` to track changes

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, watch } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0);

    const increment = () => {
      count.value++;
    };

    watch(count, (newCount, prevCount) => {
      console.log(`Count changed from ${prevCount} to ${newCount}`);
    });

    return {
      count,
      increment,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use `watch` to track changes to the `count` ref.
*   The callback function is executed whenever the value of `count` changes, allowing us to perform side effects (in this case, logging to the console).  The callback receives the new value and the previous value as arguments.

### Example 6: Using `watchEffect` to track changes

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
    <p>Double Count: {{ doubleCount }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, watchEffect } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0);
    const doubleCount = ref(0);

    const increment = () => {
      count.value++;
    };

    watchEffect(() => {
      doubleCount.value = count.value * 2;
      console.log(`Count effect triggered, doubleCount is now ${doubleCount.value}`);
    });

    return {
      count,
      increment,
      doubleCount,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use `watchEffect` to automatically track dependencies and update the `doubleCount` ref whenever `count` changes.  Vue automatically detects that the callback uses `count.value` and will re-run it whenever `count.value` is modified.
*   `watchEffect` runs *immediately* when the component is set up, then runs anytime any of the reactive properties inside of it are modified.

## Creating Composable Functions

One of the biggest advantages of the Composition API is the ability to extract reusable logic into composable functions.  A composable function is simply a function that uses Composition API functions to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.

Let's create a composable function for fetching data from an API:

```javascript
// useFetch.js
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

export function useFetch(url) {
  const data = ref(null);
  const error = ref(null);
  const loading = ref(true);

  onMounted(async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
      }
      data.value = await response.json();
    } catch (e) {
      error.value = e;
    } finally {
      loading.value = false;
    }
  });

  return { data, error, loading };
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   This `useFetch` function takes a `url` as an argument.
*   It uses `ref` to create reactive variables for the fetched data, error, and loading state.
*   It uses `onMounted` (a lifecycle hook from the Composition API) to fetch the data when the component is mounted.
*   It returns an object containing the `data`, `error`, and `loading` refs.

Now, you can use this composable function in any component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <div v-if="loading">Loading...</div>
    <div v-if="error">Error: {{ error.message }}</div>
    <div v-if="data">
      <h1>{{ data.title }}</h1>
      <p>{{ data.body }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { useFetch } from './useFetch';

export default {
  setup() {
    const { data, error, loading } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');

    return {
      data,
      error,
      loading,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We import the `useFetch` composable function.
*   Inside the `setup()` function, we call `useFetch` with the API endpoint URL.
*   We destructure the returned object to get the `data`, `error`, and `loading` refs.
*   We expose these refs to the template, allowing us to display the fetched data and handle loading and error states.

## Lifecycle Hooks

The Composition API also provides access to Vue's lifecycle hooks via functions like `onMounted`, `onUpdated`, `onUnmounted`, `onErrorCaptured`, and `onRenderTracked/Triggered`.  These hooks are called at specific points in the component's lifecycle.  They're particularly useful within composable functions.

For example, we saw `onMounted` in the `useFetch` example.  Here's another example using `onUnmounted` to clean up resources when a component is destroyed:

```vue
<script>
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue';

export default {
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0);
    let intervalId;

    onMounted(() => {
      intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        count.value++;
      }, 1000);
    });

    onUnmounted(() => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      console.log('Interval cleared');
    });

    return {
      count,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use `onMounted` to start an interval that increments the `count` ref every second.
*   We use `onUnmounted` to clear the interval when the component is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.

## Integrating with TypeScript

The Composition API works exceptionally well with TypeScript. By defining interfaces or types for your data and props, you can take full advantage of TypeScript's type checking and auto-completion features, further enhancing code maintainability and reducing errors.

```typescript
// MyComponent.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Name: {{ user.name }}</p>
    <p>Age: {{ user.age }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent, reactive } from 'vue';

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

export default defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const user: User = reactive({
      name: 'Alice',
      age: 30,
    });

    return {
      user,
    };
  },
});
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   We define a `User` interface to specify the shape of the `user` object.
*   We use TypeScript's type annotations to ensure that the `user` object conforms to the `User` interface.
