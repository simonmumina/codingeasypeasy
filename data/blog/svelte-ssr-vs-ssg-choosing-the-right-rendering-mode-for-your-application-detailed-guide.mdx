# Svelte SSR vs SSG: Choosing the Right Rendering Mode for Your Application (Detailed Guide)

Svelte and its meta-framework SvelteKit offer powerful options for building modern web applications. One of the critical decisions you'll face is choosing the right rendering mode: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG). Both approaches have distinct advantages and disadvantages, and understanding them is crucial for optimizing your application's performance, SEO, and overall user experience. This guide provides a detailed comparison of SSR and SSG in Svelte, helping you make an informed decision for your project.

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) involves rendering your Svelte components on the server each time a user requests a page. The server then sends the fully rendered HTML to the browser. The browser parses this HTML, displays the initial content, and then hydrates the application, making it interactive.

**Key Characteristics of SSR:**

- **Dynamic Content:** Ideal for applications with frequently changing data or personalized content.
- **SEO Benefits:** Search engine crawlers can easily index the fully rendered HTML, improving SEO.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Faster FCP compared to Client-Side Rendering (CSR) as the browser receives the initial HTML immediately.
- **Server Requirements:** Requires a server to handle requests and render content.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** TTI can be slower than SSG due to server processing and hydration.

**SvelteKit Implementation (SSR):**

By default, SvelteKit projects are configured for SSR. This means that unless specifically configured otherwise, routes will be rendered on the server when requested. You can manage this using the `+page.server.ts` file.

Let's look at a simple example:

```plaintext filename="+page.server.ts"
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ fetch }) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'); // Replace with your API endpoint
  const todo = await res.json();

  return {
    todo
  };
};
```

```svelte filename="+page.svelte"
<script>
  export let data;
  $: ({ todo } = data);
</script>

<h1>Todo Details</h1>
<p>Title: {todo.title}</p>
<p>Completed: {todo.completed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>

```

In this example:

1.  `+page.server.ts` is the server-side load function.
2.  `load` function fetches data from an API endpoint.
3.  The fetched `todo` data is passed as a prop to the `+page.svelte` component.
4.  The component displays the `todo` data.

Each time a user requests this page, the server will execute the `load` function, fetch the data, and render the component with the fetched data _before_ sending it to the browser.

## What is Static Site Generation (SSG)?

Static Site Generation (SSG) involves pre-rendering your Svelte components at build time. The output is a collection of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served directly from a CDN or web server.

**Key Characteristics of SSG:**

- **Excellent Performance:** Faster load times and improved performance because the browser only needs to download and display static files.
- **SEO Benefits:** Similar to SSR, search engine crawlers can easily index static HTML.
- **Scalability:** Easy to scale as you can serve static files from a CDN.
- **No Server Required (for basic serving):** Can be hosted on simple static file servers like Netlify or Vercel.
- **Less Dynamic Content:** Suitable for content that doesn't change frequently, such as blog posts, documentation, or marketing websites.
- **Rebuilds for Changes:** Requires rebuilding and redeploying the entire site when content changes.

**SvelteKit Implementation (SSG):**

SvelteKit provides several ways to implement SSG. The simplest is to configure routes to be pre-rendered during the build process. This involves using the `prerender` property in your `+page.js` or `+page.ts` file.

```plaintext filename="+page.ts"
export const prerender = true;

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ fetch }) => {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'); // Replace with your API endpoint
  const todo = await res.json();

  return {
    todo
  };
};
```

```svelte filename="+page.svelte"
<script>
  export let data;
  $: ({ todo } = data);
</script>

<h1>Todo Details</h1>
<p>Title: {todo.title}</p>
<p>Completed: {todo.completed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
```

In this example:

1.  `prerender = true` tells SvelteKit to pre-render this route during the build process.
2.  The `load` function fetches data from the API.
3.  The `+page.svelte` component displays the data.

During the build process, SvelteKit will execute the `load` function, fetch the data, and generate a static HTML file for this route. This HTML file will be served directly to the browser when a user requests the page.

**Handling Dynamic Routes with SSG:**

For scenarios where you need to generate static pages for dynamic routes (e.g., blog posts based on ID), you can use the `getStaticPaths` function. This function tells SvelteKit which routes to pre-render.

```plaintext filename="+page.ts"
import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Replace with your actual data source
  const ids = ['1', '2', '3'];

  return ids.map((id) => ({ params: { id } }));
}

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params, fetch }) => {
  const { id } = params;
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${id}`);
  const todo = await res.json();

  return {
    todo
  };
};

export const prerender = true;
```

```svelte filename="+page.svelte"
<script>
  export let data;
  $: ({ todo } = data);
</script>

<h1>Todo Details</h1>
<p>Title: {todo.title}</p>
<p>Completed: {todo.completed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
```

In this example:

1.  `getStaticPaths` defines the possible values for the `id` parameter. SvelteKit generates a static page for each ID returned by this function.
2.  The `load` function fetches data based on the `id` parameter.
3.  The `prerender = true` declaration is required to enable pre-rendering.

| **Use Cases**       | E-commerce, web applications, dynamic content | Blogs, documentation, marketing websites                     |

## Choosing the Right Approach for Your Svelte Application

The best rendering mode for your Svelte application depends on your specific requirements and priorities. Here's a decision-making guide:

- **Choose SSR if:**
  - You need dynamic content that changes frequently.
  - You need personalized content for each user.
  - SEO is critical, and you want to ensure search engine crawlers can easily index your content.
  - You are building a web application with complex interactions and server-side logic.
- **Choose SSG if:**
  - Your content is primarily static or changes infrequently.
  - Performance is a top priority.
  - You want to minimize server costs and complexity.
  - You are building a blog, documentation site, marketing website, or portfolio.
- **Hybrid Approach:** SvelteKit also allows for a hybrid approach where some routes are rendered using SSR and others using SSG. This provides flexibility to optimize performance and SEO for different parts of your application. You could leverage SSG for the initial landing pages, and then SSR for the more dynamic areas after a user authenticates.

## Optimizing Performance Further

Regardless of whether you choose SSR or SSG, there are several ways to further optimize your Svelte application's performance:

- **Code Splitting:** Break your code into smaller chunks to improve initial load times.
- **Lazy Loading:** Load resources only when they are needed.
- **Image Optimization:** Optimize images for the web to reduce file sizes.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to reduce server load and improve response times.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Use a CDN to distribute your static assets closer to users.
- **Browser Caching:** Utilize browser caching headers to allow browsers to cache assets locally.

## Conclusion

Choosing between SSR and SSG in Svelte is a crucial decision that impacts your application's performance, SEO, and scalability. By understanding the key differences between these rendering modes and carefully considering your project's requirements, you can make the right choice and build a high-performing, user-friendly web application. Remember that SvelteKit provides the flexibility to mix and match SSR and SSG, allowing you to optimize different parts of your application based on their specific needs. Happy coding!
