# Mocking API Calls in Gatsby Tests: A Comprehensive Guide

Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of your Gatsby website. One of the most common challenges in testing is dealing with external API calls. We don't want our tests to rely on a live API, which can be unreliable, slow, and potentially costly. Mocking API calls allows us to simulate these external dependencies, giving us complete control over the test environment and allowing for faster, more predictable, and more isolated tests.

This guide will walk you through the process of mocking API calls in your Gatsby tests using **Jest** (the default test runner for Gatsby) and **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**. MSW is a powerful and versatile library that intercepts HTTP requests at the browser level, enabling us to seamlessly mock API calls without modifying our application code.

## Why Mock API Calls in Gatsby Tests?

- **Isolation:** Tests become independent of external services, preventing failures due to API downtime or unexpected data changes.
- **Speed:** Mocking eliminates network latency, leading to significantly faster test execution.
- **Predictability:** You control the API response, guaranteeing consistent results and eliminating flakiness in your tests.
- **Control over Error Scenarios:** Simulate different API responses, including error codes and edge cases, to test how your application handles them.
- **Cost Savings:** Avoid unnecessary API calls during testing, especially if you're using a paid API.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Gatsby requires Node.js to run.
- **Gatsby CLI:** You likely already have this if you're working on a Gatsby project. If not, install it globally: `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
- **A Gatsby Project:** This guide assumes you have an existing Gatsby project. If not, create a new one using `gatsby new my-gatsby-site`

## Step-by-Step Guide: Mocking API Calls with MSW

This guide assumes you're using Jest as your test runner, which comes by default in Gatsby. If you're using another runner, the initialization and setup might be different.

### 1. Install MSW

First, install MSW as a development dependency:

```plaintext
npm install msw --save-dev
# or
yarn add msw --dev
```

### 2. Create a Mock API Service Worker

Create a new file to define your mock API handlers. A common practice is to create a directory called `__mocks__` at the root of your project (or within a specific component's directory). Inside the `__mocks__` directory create a `handlers.js` file.

```plaintext
// __mocks__/handlers.js
import { rest } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  rest.get('https://api.example.com/posts', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.status(200),
      ctx.json([
        { id: 1, title: 'Mocked Post 1', body: 'This is the body of the mocked post 1.' },
        { id: 2, title: 'Mocked Post 2', body: 'This is the body of the mocked post 2.' },
      ])
    )
  }),

  // Example of mocking a POST request
  rest.post('https://api.example.com/comments', (req, res, ctx) => {
    const { text, postId } = req.body

    // Simulate saving to a database and returning a new ID.
    return res(ctx.status(201), ctx.json({ id: 3, text: text, postId: postId }))
  }),

  // Example of mocking an error response
  rest.get('https://api.example.com/error', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.status(500), ctx.json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' }))
  }),
]
```

**Explanation:**

- **`rest`:** This object provides methods for defining request handlers for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- **`rest.get('https://api.example.com/posts', ...)`:** This defines a handler for GET requests to the specified URL.
- **`(req, res, ctx) => { ... }`:** This is the request handler function.
  - `req`: The request object containing information about the incoming request.
  - `res`: The response object used to construct the mock response.
  - `ctx`: The context object providing helper functions for constructing responses (status codes, JSON responses, headers, etc.).
- **`ctx.status(200)`:** Sets the HTTP status code of the response to 200 (OK).
- **`ctx.json([...])`:** Sets the response body to a JSON array containing the mock data.
- **`rest.post(...)`**: Shows an example POST handler with simulated server-side creation of resources.
- **`rest.get(...)`**: Shows an example error handler returning a 500 status code.

### 3. Create a Service Worker File

MSW needs a service worker to intercept requests in the browser. Create a `public/mockServiceWorker.js` file and add the following content:

```plaintext
// public/mockServiceWorker.js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-shadow
  const { worker } = require('../src/mocks/browser')
  worker.start()
}
```

**Important Note:** This path depends on where your `browser.js` file is located. Update it accordingly.

### 4. Initialize MSW in Your Tests

You need to initialize MSW before running your tests. Create a setup file for Jest (e.g., `src/test/setupTests.js`) and add the following code:

```plaintext
// src/test/setupTests.js
import { server } from './mocks/server' // Adjust path as needed
// Establish API mocking before all tests.
beforeAll(() => server.listen())

// Reset any request handlers that we may add during the tests,
// so they don't interfere with other tests.
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())

// Clean up after the tests are finished.
afterAll(() => server.close())
```

You'll need to tell Jest about this file using `setupFilesAfterEnv` in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-jest',
      options: {
        identity: '__jest',
        setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/test/setupTests.js'],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Alternatively, you can place this setting directly in your `package.json` under the `jest` configuration like so:

```plaintext
{
  // ... other config
  "jest": {
    "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/src/test/setupTests.js"]
  }
}
```

Now, create the file referenced in `setupTests.js` called `src/mocks/server.js`:

```plaintext
// src/mocks/server.js
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

// This configures a request mocking server with the given request handlers.
export const server = setupServer(...handlers)
```

And `src/mocks/browser.js`:

```plaintext
// src/mocks/browser.js
import { setupWorker } from 'msw'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

// This configures a request mocking service worker with the given request handlers.
export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import { server } from './mocks/server'`:** Imports the mock server instance.
- **`beforeAll(() => server.listen())`:** Starts the mock server before all tests in the suite. This ensures that all API calls during the tests will be intercepted by MSW.
- **`afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())`:** Resets the request handlers after each test. This is important to prevent tests from interfering with each other.
- **`afterAll(() => server.close())`:** Closes the mock server after all tests are finished.

### 5. Write Your Test

Now, let's write a test that uses the mocked API. Assume you have a component called `PostList.js` that fetches and displays a list of posts from the API.

```plaintext
// src/components/PostList.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const PostList = () => {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts')
        const data = await response.json()
        setPosts(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching posts:', error)
        setPosts([]) // Handle errors gracefully
      }
    }

    fetchData()
  }, [])

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.body}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

export default PostList
```

Now, create a test file for `PostList.js` (e.g., `src/components/PostList.test.js`):

```plaintext
// src/components/PostList.test.js
import React from 'react'
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'
import PostList from './PostList'

describe('PostList Component', () => {
  it('fetches and displays posts correctly', async () => {
    render(<PostList />)

    // Wait for the mock API call to resolve and the component to update.
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Mocked Post 1')).toBeInTheDocument()
      expect(screen.getByText('This is the body of the mocked post 1.')).toBeInTheDocument()
      expect(screen.getByText('Mocked Post 2')).toBeInTheDocument()
      expect(screen.getByText('This is the body of the mocked post 2.')).toBeInTheDocument()
    })
  })

  it('handles API errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Override the handler specifically for this test to simulate an error.
    server.use(
      rest.get('https://api.example.com/posts', (req, res, ctx) => {
        return res(ctx.status(500), ctx.json({ message: 'Simulated API Error' }))
      })
    )

    render(<PostList />)

    // Since we're now handling the error and setting posts to empty array
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.queryByText('Mocked Post 1')).not.toBeInTheDocument()
      expect(screen.queryByText('Mocked Post 2')).not.toBeInTheDocument()
    })
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'`:** Imports testing utilities from React Testing Library.
- **`render(<PostList />)`:** Renders the `PostList` component.
- **`await waitFor(() => { ... })`:** This is crucial because the API call is asynchronous. `waitFor` ensures that the test waits for the component to update after the data is fetched and rendered.
- **`expect(screen.getByText('Mocked Post 1')).toBeInTheDocument();`:** Asserts that the text "Mocked Post 1" (which is part of the mocked data) is present in the rendered component.
- **Error Handling Test:** This showcases how to mock an error scenario by overriding the existing API handler using `server.use()`. This allows testing error boundary or display of error messages in the component. The `queryByText` method is used to verify that the elements that would be rendered if the API call was successful are no longer present.

### 6. Run Your Tests

Run your tests using `gatsby test`. You should see the test pass, verifying that the API call was successfully mocked and that the component renders the mocked data.

## Advanced Mocking Techniques

- **Dynamic Mocking:** You can use `req.url.searchParams` in your handler functions to create dynamic mocks based on the request parameters. This is useful for APIs that support filtering or pagination.

  ```plaintext
  // __mocks__/handlers.js
  import { rest } from 'msw'

  export const handlers = [
    rest.get('https://api.example.com/products', (req, res, ctx) => {
      const category = req.url.searchParams.get('category')

      let products = [
        { id: 1, name: 'Product A', category: 'electronics' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Product B', category: 'clothing' },
        { id: 3, name: 'Product C', category: 'electronics' },
      ]

      if (category) {
        products = products.filter((product) => product.category === category)
      }

      return res(ctx.status(200), ctx.json(products))
    }),
  ]
  ```

- **Mocking POST Requests with Body Data:** The example `handlers.js` already shows how to mock POST request with body data, using `req.body` to access the request's payload.

- **Conditional Mocking:** Use environment variables or feature flags to conditionally enable or disable mocking in different environments. This can be useful for integration tests where you want to test against a real API.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Mock Data Realistic:** Strive to create mock data that closely resembles the structure and content of the real API responses. This will make your tests more effective and prevent unexpected issues when you deploy your application.
- **Maintain Mock Data:** As your API evolves, update your mock data to reflect the changes. This ensures that your tests remain accurate and reliable.
- **Use Descriptive Handler Names:** Use clear and descriptive names for your mock API handlers to improve the readability and maintainability of your test code.
- **Consider a Dedicated Mocks Directory:** Organize your mock API definitions into a dedicated directory (e.g., `__mocks__`) to keep your test code clean and well-structured.
- **Test Edge Cases:** Don't just test the happy path. Also, test how your application handles error scenarios, invalid data, and other edge cases.
