# Fix: 'null is not an object (evaluating 'RNGestureHandlerModule.default.Direction')' Error in React Native

Encountering the dreaded "null is not an object (evaluating `RNGestureHandlerModule.default.Direction`)" error in your React Native application can be frustrating. This error commonly arises when there are issues with the `react-native-gesture-handler` library, often indicating a problem with its installation, linking, or version compatibility. This guide will walk you through the common causes and provide detailed solutions to help you resolve this issue and get your application running smoothly.

## Understanding the Error

The error message "null is not an object (evaluating `RNGestureHandlerModule.default.Direction`)" essentially means that the React Native bridge cannot find the native module `RNGestureHandlerModule`. This module is essential for the `react-native-gesture-handler` library to function, as it provides the native implementations for gesture handling. The `Direction` property is part of the module's API. When the module is not properly linked or initialized, the JavaScript code tries to access properties of a null object, resulting in this error.

## Common Causes

Here's a breakdown of the most frequent reasons why you might encounter this error:

1.  **Missing or Incorrect Native Module Linking:** The `react-native-gesture-handler` library requires native module linking to connect the JavaScript code to the native (iOS/Android) components. If the linking process wasn't successful, the native module won't be available.

2.  **Incorrect Installation:** An incomplete or corrupted installation of `react-native-gesture-handler` can lead to missing files or incorrect configurations.

3.  **Cache Issues:** The Metro bundler or native build systems might be using outdated cached versions of the library, leading to inconsistencies.

4.  **Version Incompatibility:** The version of `react-native-gesture-handler` might not be compatible with your React Native version or other dependencies.

5.  **Issues with Native Build Process:** Problems during the native build process (e.g., with Xcode or Gradle) can prevent the native module from being properly included in the application.

6.  **`react-native-reanimated` Interference:** If you're using `react-native-reanimated`, ensure its version is compatible with `react-native-gesture-handler`. Conflicts between these two libraries are common.

## Solutions: A Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the error:

### 1. Verify Installation and Linking

First, ensure that `react-native-gesture-handler` is properly installed and linked in your project.

```plaintext
npm install react-native-gesture-handler
# or
yarn add react-native-gesture-handler
```

After installing, you need to link the native modules. React Native versions 0.60 and higher (using Autolinking) _should_ automatically link the module, but it's good to verify and manually link if necessary. For older versions, or if you are unsure, proceed with the manual linking steps.

**For React Native < 0.60 (Manual Linking):**

```plaintext
react-native link react-native-gesture-handler
```

**For iOS (Regardless of React Native Version):**

Navigate to your iOS project directory (`ios/`) and run:

```plaintext
pod install
```

This command updates your Xcode project with the necessary native dependencies defined in your `Podfile`. **This step is _crucial_ for iOS projects, even with autolinking.**

**Important iOS Considerations:**

- **Podfile Errors:** If you encounter errors during `pod install`, make sure your `Podfile` is correctly configured. A common issue is an incorrect platform version. Check your `Podfile` and ensure it looks something like this:

  ```plaintext
  platform :ios, '11.0'  # Adjust the version number as needed

  require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

  target 'YourProjectName' do
    config = use_native_modules!

    # Flags change depending on the env vars.
    flags = get_default_flags()

    pod 'FBLazyVector', :path => "../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/FBLazyVector"
    pod 'FBReactNativeSpec', :path => "../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/FBReactNativeSpec"
    pod 'RCTRequired', :path => "../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/RCTRequired"
    pod 'RCTTypeSafety', :path => "../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/RCTTypeSafety"
    pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/'
    pod 'React-Core', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/react-core'
    pod 'React-CoreModules', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/React/CoreModules'
    pod 'React-RCTLinking', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/LinkingIOS'
    pod 'React-RCTNetwork', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Network'
    pod 'React-RCTSettings', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Settings'
    pod 'React-ART', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/Libraries/ART'
    pod 'React-jsi', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/jsi'
    pod 'React-jsiexecutor', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/jsiexecutor'
    pod 'React-jsinspector', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/jsinspector'
    pod 'ReactCommon/callinvoker', :path => "../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon"
    pod 'ReactCommon/turbomodule/core', :path => "../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon"
    pod 'Yoga', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga'

    target 'YourProjectNameTests' do
      inherit! :complete
      # Pods for testing
    end

    post_install do |installer|
      react_native_post_install(installer)
      __apply_Xcode_12_5_M1_post_install_workaround(installer)
    end
  end

  post_install do |installer|
    react_native_post_install(installer)
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        if config.base_configuration_reference != nil
          config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '11.0' #or your version
        end
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  Replace `'YourProjectName'` with your actual project name. Adjust the `platform :ios, '11.0'` version to match your project's deployment target (check your Xcode project settings). The `post_install` block is important to maintain the correct deployment target.

- **Clean Build Folder:** In Xcode, try cleaning the build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder). This forces Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

- **Derived Data:** Clearing the derived data can sometimes help. You can usually find it in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`. Be careful when deleting this folder.

**For Android (Usually Autolinked, but verify):**

While autolinking usually works on Android, you can verify that the necessary changes have been made to your `android/settings.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files. Generally, you don't need to modify these manually.

### 2. Clear Cache and Rebuild

After linking (or verifying linking), clear the Metro bundler cache and rebuild your application:

```plaintext
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

This command clears the cache and restarts the Metro bundler.

Then, rebuild your native application:

```plaintext
npx react-native run-ios  # For iOS
npx react-native run-android # For Android
```

These commands will rebuild and reinstall your application on your device or emulator.

### 3. Check Version Compatibility

Ensure that your `react-native-gesture-handler` version is compatible with your React Native version and any other related libraries (like `react-native-reanimated`). Refer to the documentation for each library to check compatibility matrices.

To check your current `react-native-gesture-handler` version:

```plaintext
npm list react-native-gesture-handler
# or
yarn list react-native-gesture-handler
```

To check your React Native version:

```plaintext
npx react-native --version
```

If there's a compatibility issue, try updating or downgrading `react-native-gesture-handler` to a compatible version. For example:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-gesture-handler@<version>
# or
yarn add react-native-gesture-handler@<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the desired version number. Remember to rerun `pod install` (for iOS) and rebuild after changing versions.

### 4. Addressing `react-native-reanimated` Conflicts

If you're using `react-native-reanimated`, ensure that its version is compatible with both your React Native version _and_ `react-native-gesture-handler`. Incompatible versions of these libraries are a frequent source of problems.

Example of common reanimated problems:

```plaintext
import Animated from 'react-native-reanimated' // Make sure this is compatible with gesture handler
```

Check the `react-native-reanimated` documentation for compatibility information. Update `react-native-reanimated` if needed:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-reanimated@<version>
# or
yarn add react-native-reanimated@<version>
```

Again, replace `<version>` with the compatible version. After updating, rebuild your native app. Pay close attention to the reanimated installation instructions, as it requires special setup in your `babel.config.js` file:

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
}
```

**Important:** The `react-native-reanimated/plugin` _must_ be listed last in the `plugins` array in your `babel.config.js`.

### 5. Check for Typos and Import Errors

Double-check your code for any typos in import statements or incorrect usage of the `react-native-gesture-handler` API. Ensure you are importing components correctly:

```plaintext
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'

// Wrap your root component with GestureHandlerRootView
function App() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* Your application content */}
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  )
}

export default App
```

**Note:** Using `GestureHandlerRootView` as the root component is often required for `react-native-gesture-handler` to function correctly, especially with newer versions.

### 6. Clean and Rebuild Native Projects (Advanced)

If the problem persists, try a more thorough cleaning of your native projects:

**For iOS:**

1.  Close Xcode.
2.  Delete the `ios/build` folder.
3.  Delete the `ios/Podfile.lock` file.
4.  Run `pod install` in the `ios/` directory.
5.  Open your project in Xcode and clean the build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
6.  Build and run your application.

**For Android:**

1.  Close your Android Studio project.
2.  Delete the `android/app/build` and `android/.gradle` folders.
3.  In Android Studio, select "Build" -> "Clean Project".
4.  Select "Build" -> "Rebuild Project".
5.  Run your application.

These steps ensure a completely fresh build of your native projects.

### 7. Review Native Build Logs

Carefully examine the build logs in Xcode (for iOS) or Gradle (for Android) for any errors or warnings related to `react-native-gesture-handler` or its dependencies. These logs can often provide valuable clues about the root cause of the problem. Look for messages indicating missing files, linking errors, or version conflicts.

### 8. Example Code

Here's a simple example demonstrating the basic usage of `react-native-gesture-handler` with a `PanGestureHandler`:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native'
import { GestureHandlerRootView, PanGestureHandler, State } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'
import Animated, {
  useAnimatedGestureHandler,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  useSharedValue,
  withSpring,
} from 'react-native-reanimated'

const SIZE = 100

const App = () => {
  const translateX = useSharedValue(0)
  const translateY = useSharedValue(0)

  const gestureHandler = useAnimatedGestureHandler({
    onStart: (event, context) => {
      context.startX = translateX.value
      context.startY = translateY.value
    },
    onActive: (event, context) => {
      translateX.value = context.startX + event.translationX
      translateY.value = context.startY + event.translationY
    },
    onEnd: (event) => {
      translateX.value = withSpring(0)
      translateY.value = withSpring(0)
    },
  })

  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      transform: [{ translateX: translateX.value }, { translateY: translateY.value }],
    }
  })

  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <PanGestureHandler onGestureEvent={gestureHandler}>
        <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyle]} />
      </PanGestureHandler>
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    width: SIZE,
    height: SIZE,
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    borderRadius: 20,
  },
})

export default App
```

Make sure you have all dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-reanimated
# or
yarn add react-native-reanimated
```

And follow the reanimated installation instructions regarding the babel plugin.

This example requires `react-native-reanimated` and uses a `PanGestureHandler` to allow dragging a blue box around the screen. Ensure that `GestureHandlerRootView` wraps your root component.
