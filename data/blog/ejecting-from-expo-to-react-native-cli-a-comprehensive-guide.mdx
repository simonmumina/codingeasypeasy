# Ejecting from Expo to React Native CLI: A Comprehensive Guide

Expo is a fantastic framework for building cross-platform mobile applications quickly and easily. It simplifies the development process with its managed workflow, providing a pre-configured environment and a suite of tools. However, as your project evolves, you might find yourself needing more control over the native code or requiring functionalities not readily available in the Expo ecosystem. This is where ejecting to React Native CLI comes in.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of ejecting your Expo project to a bare React Native CLI project. We'll cover the preparations, the eject process itself, troubleshooting common issues, and the benefits of moving to a bare workflow.

## Why Eject from Expo?

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand the "why." Ejecting from Expo grants you greater flexibility and control, but it also comes with increased complexity. Here are some common reasons why you might consider ejecting:

- **Need for Native Modules:** Expo provides a wide range of APIs, but you may need to integrate native modules (written in Swift/Objective-C for iOS or Kotlin/Java for Android) not supported by Expo. This is especially relevant when dealing with custom hardware, specific device features, or performance-critical tasks.
- **Advanced Customization:** The Expo managed workflow has limitations in terms of deep customization of the native environment. Ejecting allows you to modify native build settings, integrate with third-party native libraries, and tailor the app's behavior to specific platform requirements.
- **Performance Optimization:** In some cases, you might need to optimize the app's performance by directly manipulating native code, which is not possible within the Expo managed workflow.
- **Control Over Updates:** While Expo provides over-the-air (OTA) updates, ejecting gives you full control over the update process and allows you to manage updates through the app stores directly.
- **Requirement to use specific native libraries:** Some libraries simply aren't available as managed Expo plugins.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the eject process, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Make sure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher recommended) and either npm or yarn installed on your system.
- **Expo CLI:** You should have the Expo CLI installed globally. If not, install it using:

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g expo-cli
  # or
  yarn global add expo-cli
  ```

- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Required for Android development. Install the latest version of the JDK.
- **Android Studio:** Necessary for building and running your Android app. Download and install Android Studio, and configure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable. You also need to set up an Android emulator or connect a physical Android device.
- **Xcode:** Required for iOS development. Download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store. You also need to set up an iOS simulator or connect a physical iOS device.
- **CocoaPods:** For managing iOS dependencies. Install it using:

  ```plaintext
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```

- **A Clean Git Repository:** It's highly recommended to have a clean Git repository before ejecting. This allows you to easily revert if something goes wrong.

## Preparing Your Expo Project

Before ejecting, it's crucial to prepare your project. This involves:

1.  **Updating Expo SDK Version:** Ensure your Expo SDK version is up-to-date. Run the following command:

    ```plaintext
    expo upgrade
    ```

2.  **Addressing Deprecation Warnings:** Resolve any deprecation warnings in your code. These warnings often indicate features that will be removed in future Expo SDK versions, and addressing them now will prevent potential issues after ejecting.

3.  **Understanding Expo Unimodules:** Many Expo APIs are provided through "unimodules." After ejecting, you'll need to install these unimodules as separate dependencies. Familiarize yourself with the unimodules your project uses.

4.  **Removing Unnecessary Expo Packages:** Identify and remove any Expo packages you're not actually using. This will reduce the size of your project and simplify the transition.

5.  **Testing Your App:** Thoroughly test your app on both Android and iOS before ejecting. This will help you identify any issues that might arise during the eject process.

## The Eject Process

The eject process is initiated using the `expo eject` command. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Navigate to your project directory:** Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Expo project.

    ```plaintext
    cd my-expo-project
    ```

2.  **Run the eject command:** Execute the following command:

    ```plaintext
    expo eject
    ```

3.  **Choose the Eject Method:** Expo CLI will present you with three options:

    - **"Expo Go and classic builds (managed, but get native build files)":** This option generates native project files (iOS and Android) that are compatible with Expo Go and Expo Application Services (EAS). It's the recommended option if you want to continue using Expo services for building and submitting your app. You can still use `expo run:ios` and `expo run:android` to run the app.
    - **"React Native CLI Configuration (bare)":** This option creates a completely bare React Native CLI project, giving you full control over the native environment. You will no longer be able to use Expo Go or EAS Build with this option. This is the focus of this guide.
    - **"Cancel":** Cancels the eject process.

    Select **"React Native CLI Configuration (bare)"**. You might be prompted to enter your app name. This name will be used for the iOS bundle identifier and Android package name.

4.  **Installation of Dependencies:** The CLI will then install the necessary dependencies for the bare React Native project. This process might take a while, depending on your internet connection and the size of your project.

5.  **Post-Eject Steps:** After the eject process is complete, the CLI will provide instructions for setting up your native development environment. These instructions typically involve:

    - Installing CocoaPods for iOS: Run `cd ios && pod install` in your terminal.
    - Sync Gradle for Android: Open the `android` folder in Android Studio and allow Gradle to sync.

## Running Your Ejected App

After successfully ejecting, you can now run your app using the React Native CLI.

### Running on iOS

1.  **Navigate to the `ios` directory:**

    ```plaintext
    cd ios
    ```

2.  **Install pods:**

    ```plaintext
    pod install
    ```

3.  **Build and run the app:**

    ```plaintext
    npx react-native run-ios
    ```

    This will build and launch your app in the iOS simulator. Alternatively, you can open the `ios/<YourProjectName>.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and run the app from there.

### Running on Android

1.  **Ensure your Android emulator is running or a physical device is connected.**

2.  **From the root directory of your project, run:**

    ```plaintext
    npx react-native run-android
    ```

    This will build and launch your app on the Android emulator or connected device. Alternatively, you can open the `android` folder in Android Studio and run the app from there.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Ejecting can sometimes be a bumpy ride. Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **CocoaPods Issues:** If you encounter issues with CocoaPods, try updating CocoaPods to the latest version:

  ```plaintext
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```

  Then, clean your CocoaPods cache and reinstall dependencies:

  ```plaintext
  rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods
  pod deintegrate
  pod clean
  pod install
  ```

- **Gradle Sync Issues:** If you encounter Gradle sync errors in Android Studio, try the following:

  - **Clean and Rebuild Project:** In Android Studio, go to `Build -> Clean Project` and then `Build -> Rebuild Project`.
  - **Invalidate Caches / Restart:** Go to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart -> Invalidate and Restart`.
  - **Update Gradle Version:** Ensure your Gradle version is compatible with your React Native version. You can find the recommended Gradle version in the React Native documentation.
  - **Check `ANDROID_HOME`:** Double-check that your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set correctly and points to the Android SDK directory.

- **Missing Native Modules:** If your app crashes due to missing native modules, make sure you've installed all the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Also, link any native dependencies using `react-native link`. (This command is generally deprecated in favor of autolinking, but it might still be necessary in some cases.)

- **TypeScript Errors:** After ejecting, you might encounter TypeScript errors related to type definitions for Expo modules. You can try installing the `@types/expo` package:

  ```plaintext
  npm install --save-dev @types/expo
  # or
  yarn add --dev @types/expo
  ```

- **Conflicts with Existing Native Code:** If you already have some native code in your Expo project (e.g., using `expo prebuild`), ejecting might create conflicts. Carefully review the changes made by the eject process and resolve any conflicts manually. It's best to back up your native changes before running `expo eject`.

- **OTA Updates No Longer Working:** Ejecting to a bare React Native project means you lose the Expo managed OTA update functionality. You'll need to implement your own OTA update mechanism using libraries like `react-native-code-push` or similar solutions.

## Maintaining Your Ejected Project

After ejecting, you're responsible for managing the native project files and dependencies. Here are some tips for maintaining your ejected project:

- **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep your React Native version and other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.
- **Manage Native Dependencies:** Use CocoaPods for iOS and Gradle for Android to manage your native dependencies.
- **Understand Native Build Processes:** Familiarize yourself with the native build processes for both iOS and Android. This will help you troubleshoot build errors and optimize your app's performance.
- **Version Control:** Use Git to track your changes and collaborate with other developers.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with the latest React Native and native development best practices.

## Benefits of Ejecting

While ejecting introduces more complexity, it also unlocks a number of benefits:

- **Full Control:** You have complete control over the native environment and can customize every aspect of your app.
- **Access to Native APIs:** You can directly access native APIs and integrate with native modules, enabling you to implement advanced features.
- **Performance Optimization:** You can optimize your app's performance by directly manipulating native code.
- **Flexibility:** You can use any third-party library or tool, without being limited by the Expo ecosystem.

## Alternatives to Ejecting

Before ejecting, consider these alternatives:

- **Expo Plugins:** If you need to use a native module, check if there's an Expo plugin available. Expo plugins provide a managed way to integrate native code without ejecting.
- **Custom Development Client:** You can create a custom development client using Expo's tooling to add specific native modules without ejecting the entire project. This allows you to keep much of the managed workflow's benefits.
- **Evaluating if the feature is truly necessary:** Sometimes, the "must-have" native feature can be implemented with Javascript and clever workarounds, especially with the rapidly increasing capability of Javascript APIs and libraries.

## Conclusion

Ejecting from Expo to React Native CLI is a significant step that grants you more control and flexibility over your mobile app development. While it requires a deeper understanding of native development, the benefits of customization, performance optimization, and access to native APIs can be invaluable for complex projects. By following this guide and carefully addressing potential issues, you can successfully eject your Expo project and leverage the full power of React Native. Remember to weigh the pros and cons carefully and consider the alternatives before making the decision to eject. Good luck!
