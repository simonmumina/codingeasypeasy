# Next.js Interview Questions and Answers: Ace Your Next Interview (2025 Update)

Are you preparing for a Next.js interview?  The demand for skilled Next.js developers is higher than ever, making a strong understanding of the framework crucial. This comprehensive guide covers a wide range of Next.js interview questions and provides detailed answers with code examples to help you confidently tackle your next interview.  We'll explore core concepts, common challenges, and best practices, ensuring you're well-equipped to showcase your Next.js expertise.

## Introduction to Next.js

Before diving into the questions, let's briefly recap what makes Next.js so popular. Next.js is a React framework built on top of Node.js that provides production-ready features like:

*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Improves SEO and initial load time.
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Generates static HTML at build time for lightning-fast performance.
*   **API Routes:** Allows you to build backend logic directly within your Next.js application.
*   **Automatic Code Splitting:** Optimizes bundle size by only loading the necessary JavaScript.
*   **File-Based Routing:** Simplifies route management using the file system.
*   **Built-in CSS Support:** Supports CSS Modules, Sass, and Styled JSX.
*   **Fast Refresh:** Provides near-instant feedback during development.

##  Core Next.js Concepts

Let's cover some fundamental concepts that are frequently tested during interviews:

### 1. What is Next.js, and why should I use it?

**Answer:** Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. It offers several advantages over traditional React applications, including:

*   **Improved SEO:** SSR and SSG make your content easily crawlable by search engines.
*   **Performance:**  Optimized for speed with features like automatic code splitting and image optimization.
*   **Developer Experience:**  Simplified development process with features like file-based routing and built-in CSS support.
*   **Full-Stack Capabilities:**  API routes allow you to build backend logic within your Next.js application.
*   **Scalability:**  Well-suited for building both small and large-scale applications.

### 2. What are the key differences between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js? When would you choose one over the other?

**Answer:**

*   **SSR (Server-Side Rendering):** Pages are rendered on the server for each request. This ensures that the initial HTML sent to the browser is fully populated with content, which is excellent for SEO and improving the perceived loading time for users.  SSR is suitable for dynamic content that changes frequently, such as user profiles or e-commerce product pages.

*   **SSG (Static Site Generation):** Pages are generated at build time and served as static HTML files.  This results in incredibly fast loading times because the server simply delivers pre-built files. SSG is ideal for content that doesn't change frequently, such as blog posts, documentation, or marketing pages.

**When to Choose:**

*   **SSR:** Use SSR when you need dynamic content that changes frequently or requires real-time data fetching.
*   **SSG:** Use SSG when you have static content that doesn't change often and you want the best possible performance.

**Code Example (SSR):**

```javascript
// pages/index.js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}

function HomePage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Server-Side Rendered Data</h1>
      <p>Title: {data.title}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

**Code Example (SSG):**

```javascript
// pages/about.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      message: 'This page was statically generated!',
    },
  }
}

function AboutPage({ message }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <p>{message}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default AboutPage
```

### 3. What is `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`? What are their use cases?

**Answer:**

*   **`getStaticProps`:** This function fetches data at build time.  It is used for SSG and is executed only on the server-side. The data returned from `getStaticProps` is passed as props to the page component. It is useful when you want to fetch data from an API or database to pre-render the page content.

*   **`getServerSideProps`:** This function fetches data on each request. It is used for SSR and is also executed only on the server-side.  The data returned from `getServerSideProps` is passed as props to the page component. It's useful when you need to fetch data that changes frequently or depends on the user's request.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature           | `getStaticProps`                                    | `getServerSideProps`                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution Time    | Build time                                           | Each request                                        |
| Rendering Type    | SSG                                                   | SSR                                                   |
| Data Frequency     | Infrequent changes, static data                    | Frequent changes, dynamic data                       |
| Performance        | Extremely fast due to pre-rendering                | Slower than SSG due to server-side rendering       |
| When to Use       | Blog posts, documentation, marketing pages          | User profiles, e-commerce product pages, dynamic dashboards |

### 4. What is `getStaticPaths` and why is it used with `getStaticProps`?

**Answer:**  `getStaticPaths` is used in conjunction with `getStaticProps` to generate static pages for dynamic routes. It defines which paths should be pre-rendered at build time.  It returns an object with the following properties:

*   `paths`: An array of objects, where each object specifies a path to be pre-rendered. Each object must have a `params` key containing the values for the dynamic route parameters.
*   `fallback`:  A boolean value that determines what happens when a user navigates to a path that hasn't been pre-rendered.  Possible values are `false`, `true`, and `'blocking'`.

**Use Cases:**

*   Dynamically generating blog posts based on data from a database or API.
*   Creating product pages for an e-commerce site where each product has its own URL.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// pages/posts/[id].js

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id.toString() },
  }))

  return { paths, fallback: false } // fallback: false means 404 if path not found
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${params.id}`);
  const post = await res.json();

  return { props: { post } }
}

function Post({ post }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.body}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Post
```

### 5. Explain the different `fallback` options in `getStaticPaths` and their implications.

**Answer:** The `fallback` option in `getStaticPaths` controls how Next.js handles requests for paths that haven't been pre-rendered at build time. There are three possible values:

*   **`fallback: false`:**  If a user requests a path that hasn't been pre-rendered, Next.js will return a 404 error page. This is the most straightforward option and is suitable when you want to ensure that only pre-rendered pages are accessible.

*   **`fallback: true`:**  If a user requests a path that hasn't been pre-rendered, Next.js will serve a fallback page while it generates the page in the background.  Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the pre-rendered page.  This provides a better user experience than `fallback: false` because it avoids displaying a 404 error. You typically use this if you want to support a large number of possible routes, but you don't want to pre-render all of them at build time.

*   **`fallback: 'blocking'`:** Similar to `fallback: true`, if a user requests a path that hasn't been pre-rendered, Next.js will generate the page on the server. However, instead of serving a fallback page, Next.js will block the request until the page is generated.  The user will then receive the fully rendered page directly. This guarantees that the user always sees the full content, but it may result in a slightly longer initial loading time for un-rendered pages.

### 6. How do you handle routing in Next.js? Explain file-based routing.

**Answer:** Next.js uses a file-based routing system. This means that the structure of your `pages` directory directly determines the routes of your application.

*   Each file in the `pages` directory becomes a route. For example, a file named `pages/about.js` will be accessible at the `/about` route.
*   Dynamic routes can be created using square brackets `[]`. For example, a file named `pages/posts/[id].js` will create a dynamic route where `id` is a parameter.  You can access the parameter using `useRouter` hook.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// pages/posts/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

function Post() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { id } = router.query

  return <p>Post: {id}</p>
}

export default Post
```

### 7. Explain the purpose of the `_app.js` file in Next.js.

**Answer:** The `_app.js` file is a special file in Next.js that allows you to:

*   **Override the default App component:** You can customize the App component to wrap all your pages with custom components, such as a layout component or a global style provider.
*   **Persist state between page transitions:**  By using the `_app.js` file, you can ensure that state is preserved when navigating between pages.
*   **Inject global styles:** You can import global CSS files in `_app.js` to apply styles across your entire application.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// pages/_app.js
import '../styles/global.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Layout>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Layout>
    </>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

### 8. What is the purpose of the `_document.js` file in Next.js?

**Answer:** The `_document.js` file allows you to override the default HTML document structure. It's used to customize the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags of your pages.  Common use cases include:

*   **Adding custom meta tags:** You can add meta tags for SEO, social sharing, or other purposes.
*   **Modifying the HTML structure:** You can customize the HTML document structure to add custom attributes or elements.
*   **Injecting global scripts:** You can inject global scripts that need to be loaded before the page is rendered.

**Important Note:**  `_document.js` is rendered on the server-side only.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// pages/_document.js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
          <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
          <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}

export default MyDocument
```

### 9. How do you handle API routes in Next.js? Give an example.

**Answer:** Next.js allows you to create API endpoints directly within your application using the `pages/api` directory. Any file in this directory becomes an API route.

*   API routes are serverless functions that handle HTTP requests.
*   You can use them to build backend logic, connect to databases, and perform other server-side tasks.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'Hello, world!' })
}
```

To access this API route, you would send a request to `/api/hello`.

### 10.  Explain how Next.js handles image optimization.

**Answer:** Next.js provides a built-in `next/image` component for optimized image loading and delivery. This component offers several benefits:

*   **Automatic Image Optimization:**  Optimizes images for different devices and screen sizes.
*   **Lazy Loading:**  Loads images only when they are visible in the viewport, improving initial page load time.
*   **Resizing:**  Resizes images to the appropriate size based on the container they are in.
*   **Modern Image Formats:**  Supports modern image formats like WebP and AVIF, which offer better compression and quality.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import Image from 'next/image'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
      height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
      width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
      alt="Your Name"
    />
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Configuration in `next.config.js` (Optional):**

You can configure the `next/image` component in your `next.config.js` file to specify allowed domains for external images, image sizes, and other options.

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['example.com', 'anotherdomain.com'], // Allowed domains for external images
    deviceSizes: [320, 480, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
  },
}
```

## Intermediate Next.js Questions

Now, let's look at some more challenging questions:

### 11. How can you implement authentication in Next.js?  What are some popular libraries for authentication?

**Answer:** There are several ways to implement authentication in Next.js:

*   **Using API Routes and Cookies:** You can create API routes for login, signup, and logout, and use cookies to store authentication tokens.
*   **Using Third-Party Authentication Providers:**  You can integrate with authentication providers like Auth0, Firebase Authentication, NextAuth.js, or Clerk.

**Popular Libraries:**

*   **NextAuth.js:** A complete open-source authentication solution specifically designed for Next.js. It supports various authentication providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub, and more.
*   **Auth0:** A popular authentication and authorization platform that provides a comprehensive set of features for user management and security.
*   **Firebase Authentication:** A cloud-based authentication service that supports various authentication methods, including email/password, social login, and phone authentication.
*   **Clerk:** User management and authentication for Next.js and React applications.

**Example (NextAuth.js):**

This is a simplified example, you would need to install `next-auth` and configure it properly.

```javascript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GithubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github"

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    }),
    // ...add more providers here
  ],
})
```

You can then access the user's session information using the `useSession` hook in your components.

### 12. How do you handle environment variables in Next.js?

**Answer:** Next.js supports environment variables using `.env` files. You can create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project to store environment variables. Next.js automatically loads these variables into `process.env`.

*   Variables defined in `.env.local` are available to both the client and server sides.
*   For environment variables that should only be available on the server-side (e.g., API keys), you can use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. Only variables with this prefix will be exposed to the client-side code.

**Example:**

```
// .env.local
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

```javascript
// pages/index.js
function HomePage() {
  const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
  return (
    <div>
      <p>API URL: {apiUrl}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

### 13. What is the purpose of the `Link` component in Next.js?  How does it improve performance?

**Answer:** The `Link` component from `next/link` is used for client-side navigation in Next.js applications. It allows you to navigate between pages without a full page reload, which significantly improves performance.

*   The `Link` component pre-fetches the linked page in the background, so when the user clicks the link, the page loads instantly.
*   It also avoids a full page reload, preserving the application's state and improving the user experience.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import Link from 'next/link'

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About Us</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

### 14. How can you deploy a Next.js application?  What are some popular hosting platforms?

**Answer:** You can deploy a Next.js application to various hosting platforms. Some popular options include:

*   **Vercel:** Vercel is a platform specifically designed for deploying Next.js applications.  It offers seamless integration with Next.js and provides features like automatic deployments, preview deployments, and global CDN.
*   **Netlify:** Netlify is another popular platform for deploying static and dynamic websites. It supports Next.js deployments and provides features like continuous deployment, serverless functions, and a global CDN.
*   **AWS Amplify:** AWS Amplify is a cloud platform for building and deploying mobile and web applications.  It supports Next.js deployments and provides features like serverless functions, authentication, and storage.
*   **DigitalOcean App Platform:**  DigitalOcean App Platform is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment and management of web applications. It supports Next.js deployments and provides features like automatic scaling, load balancing, and monitoring.
*   **Docker:** You can containerize your Next.js application using Docker and deploy it to any platform that supports Docker containers, such as AWS ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or Azure Container Instances.

### 15. Explain how to use custom server with Next.js. When would you need to use it?

**Answer:** By default, Next.js handles the server logic. However, sometimes you might need more control over the server, such as:

*   **Custom Route Handling:**  When you need more complex routing rules than the built-in file-based routing system can provide.
*   **Middleware:**  To add custom middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, or request modification.
*   **WebSockets:**  To implement real-time communication features.
*   **Integration with Existing Servers:** To integrate with existing Node.js servers or frameworks.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a `server.js` file in the root directory of your project.**
2.  **Use the `next` function to handle requests:**  This function takes a request and response object and renders the appropriate Next.js page.
3.  **Start the server using Node.js.**

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// server.js
const { createServer } = require('http')
const { parse } = require('url')
const next = require('next')

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
const app = next({ dev })
const handle = app.getRequestHandler()

app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer((req, res) => {
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true)
    const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl

    if (pathname === '/custom-route') {
      app.render(req, res, '/about', query) // Render the /about page for this route
    } else {
      handle(req, res, parsedUrl)
    }
  }).listen(3000, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log('> Ready on http://localhost:3000')
  })
})
```

In `package.json`, update the `scripts` section:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "node server.js",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js"
}
```

## Advanced Next.js Questions

Let's tackle some advanced topics:

### 16. How would you optimize a Next.js application for performance? Describe different optimization techniques.

**Answer:** Optimizing a Next.js application involves several techniques:

*   **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, only loading the necessary JavaScript for each page.  You can further optimize code splitting by using dynamic imports (`import('module')`) to load components and modules on demand.
*   **Image Optimization:** Use the `next/image` component for optimized image loading, resizing, and format conversion.
*   **Caching:** Leverage browser caching and server-side caching to reduce the number of requests to the server. You can use `Cache-Control` headers to control browser caching and use a caching layer like Redis or Memcached for server-side caching.
*   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
*   **Bundle Analysis:** Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies and optimize your bundle size.
*   **Tree Shaking:**  Ensure that your bundler (Webpack) is properly configured to remove unused code from your application.
*   **Prefetching:** Use the `Link` component's `prefetch` prop to prefetch pages that the user is likely to visit next.
*   **SSR/SSG Selection:** Choose the appropriate rendering strategy (SSR or SSG) based on the content of the page and the frequency of updates.
*   **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Use a CDN to serve your static assets from geographically distributed servers, reducing latency for users around the world.
*   **Monitoring and Performance Testing:** Regularly monitor your application's performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and WebPageTest.  Perform load testing to identify bottlenecks and optimize your application for high traffic.

### 17.  How do you handle state management in Next.js? What are some popular state management libraries you can use?

**Answer:**  Next.js is a React framework, so you can use any React state management library. Some popular options include:

*   **useState/useContext (Built-in):** For simple state management within components or across a small component tree.
*   **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Useful for complex applications with a lot of shared state. Requires boilerplate.
*   **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution.
*   **Recoil:**  A state management library from Facebook that focuses on data-flow and derived state.
*   **MobX:** A simple and scalable state management solution based on reactive programming.
*   **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate):** A React Hooks library for remote data fetching. It handles caching, revalidation, and error handling.

**Example (Zustand):**

```javascript
import create from 'zustand'

const useStore = create(set => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set(state => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrement: () => set(state => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
}))

function MyComponent() {
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useStore()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

### 18.  How would you implement internationalization (i18n) in a Next.js application?

**Answer:** There are several ways to implement i18n in Next.js:

*   **Using `next-i18next`:** A popular library that provides comprehensive i18n support for Next.js. It handles locale detection, translation loading, and routing.
*   **Using `next/router` and custom logic:** You can use the `next/router` to detect the user's locale and load the appropriate translations. This approach requires more manual configuration but gives you more control over the i18n process.
*   **Using a third-party i18n service:** You can use a third-party i18n service like Lokalise or Phrase to manage your translations and integrate them into your Next.js application.

**Example (using `next-i18next`):**

1.  **Install `next-i18next`:**

    ```bash
    npm install next-i18next i18next
    ```

2.  **Create a `next-i18next.config.js` file:**

    ```javascript
    // next-i18next.config.js
    module.exports = {
      i18n: {
        defaultLocale: 'en',
        locales: ['en', 'fr', 'es'],
      },
    }
    ```

3.  **Wrap your `_app.js` component with the `appWithTranslation` HOC:**

    ```javascript
    // pages/_app.js
    import { appWithTranslation } from 'next-i18next'

    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
      return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }

    export default appWithTranslation(MyApp)
    ```

4.  **Use the `useTranslation` hook in your components:**

    ```javascript
    // pages/index.js
    import { useTranslation } from 'next-i18next'
    import { serverSideTranslations } from 'next-i18next/serverSideTranslations'

    function HomePage() {
      const { t } = useTranslation('common')

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{t('welcome')}</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export const getStaticProps = async ({ locale }) => ({
      props: {
        ...(await serverSideTranslations(locale, ['common'])),
      },
    })

    export default HomePage
    ```

### 19.  Explain how to use Middleware in Next.js and give an example use case.

**Answer:** Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed. This is useful for tasks like:

*   **Authentication:** Verifying user authentication before allowing access to certain routes.
*   **Redirection:** Redirecting users based on their location or other criteria.
*   **Feature Flags:**  Enabling or disabling features based on user segments.
*   **Logging:** Logging requests for analytics or debugging.

**Creating Middleware:**

1.  **Create a `middleware.js` (or `middleware.ts`) file in the `pages` directory.**  This file will contain your middleware function.
2.  **The middleware function receives two arguments: `request` and `response`.**
3.  **You can use the `NextResponse` object to modify the response, redirect the user, or continue processing the request.**
4.  **Define a `config` object to specify which routes the middleware should run on.**

**Code Example (Authentication Middleware):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = req.cookies.get('authToken');

  if (!isAuthenticated && req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*'], // Run middleware on all routes under /dashboard
}
```

This middleware checks for an `authToken` cookie. If the cookie is not present and the user is trying to access a route under `/dashboard`, they are redirected to the `/login` page.

### 20. Discuss strategies for testing Next.js applications. What testing libraries and tools are recommended?

**Answer:** Testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Next.js applications. Here are some strategies and recommended tools:

*   **Unit Testing:**  Testing individual components and functions in isolation.
    *   **Jest:** A popular JavaScript testing framework with built-in support for React.
    *   **React Testing Library:**  A library that focuses on testing components from a user's perspective, avoiding implementation details.

*   **Integration Testing:**  Testing the interaction between different components and modules.
    *   **React Testing Library:** Can also be used for integration testing.
    *   **Cypress:** A powerful end-to-end testing framework that allows you to simulate user interactions and verify the behavior of your application.

*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**  Testing the entire application flow from start to finish, simulating real user interactions.
    *   **Cypress:**  A popular choice for E2E testing due to its ease of use and comprehensive features.
    *   **Playwright:** Another E2E testing framework that provides cross-browser support and advanced features like auto-waiting and tracing.

*   **Component Testing:** Testing individual React components in isolation, rendering them in a realistic environment.
    *   **Storybook:** A tool for building and testing UI components in isolation. It allows you to create stories for each component, showcasing different states and variations.

*   **Mocking:**  Using mocks to isolate components and functions from external dependencies, such as API calls or database connections.
    *   **Jest:**  Provides built-in mocking capabilities.
    *   **MSW (Mock Service Worker):**  A library that allows you to mock API requests at the network level, providing a more realistic testing environment.

**Example (Unit Test with Jest and React Testing Library):**

```javascript
// components/Button.js
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
}

export default Button;

// components/Button.test.js
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from './Button';

test('calls onClick prop when clicked', () => {
  const handleClick = jest.fn();
  render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);
  const button = screen.getByText('Click me');
  fireEvent.click(button);
  expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```
