# Cassandra Node Failure Recovery: A Comprehensive Guide to Repair and Maintenance

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed for handling massive amounts of data across many commodity servers. However, like any system, Cassandra nodes can fail. Understanding how to diagnose, repair, and recover from these failures is crucial for maintaining data consistency and cluster availability. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Cassandra node failure recovery strategies, including practical examples and best practices.

## Understanding Cassandra Architecture and Failure Domains

Before diving into repair strategies, it's essential to understand the core components of a Cassandra cluster and common failure modes.

- **Nodes:** Individual Cassandra instances. A cluster comprises multiple nodes.
- **Data Replication:** Cassandra replicates data across multiple nodes based on a replication factor (RF). This ensures data availability even if some nodes are down.
- **Gossip Protocol:** Nodes communicate with each other using the gossip protocol to share information about the cluster's state, including node status (up/down).
- **Partitioner:** Determines how data is distributed across the cluster based on partition keys.
- **Commit Log:** A persistent log of all write operations. Used for crash recovery.
- **SSTables (Sorted String Tables):** Immutable data files stored on disk. Data is eventually flushed from the commit log to SSTables.
- **Hints:** When a node is temporarily unavailable, other nodes store "hints" indicating writes that need to be replayed once the node is back online.

**Common Failure Modes:**

- **Hardware failures:** Disk failures, memory issues, network card problems, power outages.
- **Software bugs:** Unexpected errors in Cassandra itself or in the underlying operating system or Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Network connectivity issues:** Network partitions, firewall rules blocking communication between nodes.
- **Resource exhaustion:** CPU overload, memory leaks, disk space exhaustion.
- **Configuration errors:** Incorrectly configured Cassandra settings.

## Identifying Node Failures

The first step in recovery is identifying a node failure. Here are several ways to detect problems:

- **`nodetool status`:** The most basic command to check the status of all nodes in the cluster. Nodes marked as "DN" are down.

  ```plaintext
  nodetool status
  ```

  Example output:

  ```
  Datacenter: datacenter1
  =======================
  Status=Up/Down
  |/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving
  --  Address     Load       Tokens   Owns (effective)  Host ID                               Rack
  UN  10.0.0.1   150.29 MB  256      100.0%            e4b1930a-a122-4223-a5b3-d2d4e60f5722  rack1
  UN  10.0.0.2   148.55 MB  256      100.0%            f98c3a9c-0a24-4682-9047-76f8e307b96a  rack1
  DN  10.0.0.3   147.88 MB  256      100.0%            a3f5e20d-9b61-4a5c-8219-0f76d48b913c  rack1
  ```

  In this example, `10.0.0.3` is reported as down ("DN").

- **Cassandra Logs:** Examine the `system.log` file (usually located in `/var/log/cassandra/`) for error messages, exceptions, or warnings that indicate node issues. Look for stack traces, out-of-memory errors, or network connectivity problems.

- **Monitoring Tools:** Utilize monitoring tools like Prometheus with Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to track key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, latency, and error rates. Set up alerts to notify you when thresholds are breached.

- **JVM Monitoring:** Use tools like JConsole or VisualVM to monitor the JVM's heap usage, garbage collection activity, and thread activity. Excessive garbage collection or high heap usage can indicate memory leaks or resource contention.

- **Client Application Errors:** If your application starts experiencing timeouts or connection errors when accessing the Cassandra cluster, it could indicate a node failure or network issue.

## Repairing a Failed Node

The repair process depends on the nature of the failure and the state of the node. Here are several scenarios and corresponding repair strategies:

### 1. Temporary Node Outage (Down but Recoverable)

This scenario involves a node that has gone down temporarily but can be brought back online with minimal intervention.

- **Cause:** A brief network outage, a temporary resource constraint, or a short-lived software glitch.
- **Recovery:**

  1.  **Restart the Cassandra service:**

      ```plaintext
      sudo systemctl restart cassandra
      ```

      or, if using `service`:

      ```plaintext
      sudo service cassandra restart
      ```

  2.  **Monitor the logs:** Check the `system.log` for errors during startup. Look for messages indicating that the node is joining the cluster and streaming data.

  3.  **Verify the node status:** Use `nodetool status` to confirm that the node is back up ("UN") and participating in the cluster.

  4.  **Consider a `nodetool repair`**: After the node is fully up, run a repair to ensure data consistency. This is crucial if the node was down for an extended period.

      ```plaintext
      nodetool repair -pr  # Incremental, primary range repair
      ```

      **Explanation of `nodetool repair` options:**

      - `-pr` (primary range): Repairs only the data for which the node is primarily responsible. Faster and less resource-intensive than a full repair. Recommended for most cases.
      - `-full` (full repair): Repairs all data on the node, including data replicated from other nodes. More resource-intensive and takes longer. Use when `-pr` is insufficient or data corruption is suspected.
      - `-st <start_token> -et <end_token>`: Repairs a specific token range. Useful for targeted repairs.
      - `-pl`: Performs a parallel repair, which can speed up the process but may put more strain on the cluster.
      - `-local`: Runs the repair locally without contacting other nodes. Useful for repairing SSTables on a single node without affecting the rest of the cluster.

### 2. Node Out of Sync - Incremental Repair is Key

Nodes can drift out of sync with other nodes due to various reasons like network issues during writes or inconsistencies introduced by bugs. In these cases, the most effective strategy is using incremental repair. Cassandra 2.1.2 and later support incremental repairs, which are far more efficient than full repairs.

- **Cause:** Data inconsistencies due to network hiccups during writes, application bugs or outdated repairs.
- **Recovery:**

  1. **Run an incremental repair:**

     ```plaintext
     nodetool repair -pr
     ```

     The `-pr` flag tells Cassandra to only repair the _primary range_ for the node, meaning the data this node is primarily responsible for. This is a much faster and less disruptive operation than a full repair.

  2. **Monitor the repair progress:** `nodetool repair` provides output to track progress.

### 3. Permanent Node Failure (Hardware Failure or Unrecoverable Corruption)

This scenario involves a node that is permanently unavailable due to hardware failure or unrecoverable data corruption.

- **Cause:** Disk failure, severe hardware damage, or corruption of system files.
- **Recovery:**

  1.  **Decommission the failed node:** This is the most important step. Decommissioning gracefully removes the node from the cluster and redistributes its data to other nodes.

      ```plaintext
      nodetool decommission
      ```

      **Important Considerations:**

      - **Wait for the decommission process to complete.** This can take a significant amount of time, depending on the amount of data on the node and the replication factor. Monitor the Cassandra logs for progress updates.
      - **Do NOT force-decommission the node unless absolutely necessary.** Force-decommissioning can lead to data inconsistencies and should only be used as a last resort if the node is completely unresponsive.
      - **Ensure sufficient capacity on other nodes before decommissioning.** The remaining nodes will need to absorb the data previously stored on the decommissioned node.

  2.  **Replace the failed hardware:** Install a new server or replace the faulty hardware.

  3.  **Add a new node to the cluster:**

      - **Option 1: Using `auto_bootstrap: true` (Default):**

        If your Cassandra configuration (`cassandra.yaml`) has `auto_bootstrap: true` (which is the default), the new node will automatically join the cluster and start streaming data from other nodes to replicate the data it should own.

      - **Option 2: Replacing the Existing Node (Recommended):**

        A cleaner and more efficient approach is to explicitly replace the failed node using the `replace_address` option. This tells the new node to take over the token ranges and data belonging to the failed node. This minimizes data streaming and reduces the impact on the cluster.

        a. **Edit `cassandra.yaml`:** On the new node, set the `listen_address`, `rpc_address`, and `seeds` to the correct values for your cluster. Crucially, add the following line:

        ```plaintext
        replace_address_first_boot: <IP_ADDRESS_OF_FAILED_NODE>
        ```

        Replace `<IP_ADDRESS_OF_FAILED_NODE>` with the IP address of the node that you decommissioned.

        b. **Start Cassandra on the new node:**

        ```plaintext
        sudo systemctl start cassandra
        ```

        c. **Monitor the logs:** The new node will automatically join the cluster and begin streaming data from other nodes. Monitor the `system.log` for progress updates. You should see messages indicating that the node is replacing the existing node.

  4.  **Run a repair:** After the new node has fully joined the cluster and streamed all the necessary data, run a repair to ensure data consistency.

      ```plaintext
      nodetool repair -pr
      ```

### 4. Data Corruption on a Node

Sometimes, data on a node can become corrupted due to software bugs or hardware issues.

- **Cause:** File system errors, memory corruption, or bugs in Cassandra.
- **Recovery:**

  1.  **Identify the corrupted data:** This can be challenging. Look for inconsistencies or errors reported by your application or through data validation checks. Tools like `sstable2json` and `json2sstable` can be helpful for inspecting SSTable contents.

  2.  **Run `nodetool scrub`:** This command checks SSTables for corruption and removes any corrupted data. It's a good first step in addressing data corruption.

      ```plaintext
      nodetool scrub <keyspace> <table>
      ```

      **Important Notes:**

      - `nodetool scrub` can be resource-intensive. Run it during off-peak hours.
      - It's a good practice to backup your data before running `nodetool scrub`.

  3.  **Run `nodetool repair`:** After running `nodetool scrub`, run a repair to restore any data that was removed by `nodetool scrub`.

      ```plaintext
      nodetool repair -pr
      ```

  4.  **If scrubbing and repair fail:** If the data corruption is severe and `nodetool scrub` and `nodetool repair` cannot resolve the issue, you may need to restore the data from a backup. This is why regular backups are essential. Consider using `sstableloader` to import the restored data back into the cluster.

### 5. Node Unreachable Due to Network Partitioning

Network partitions occur when nodes in the cluster are unable to communicate with each other, leading to inconsistent views of the cluster state.

- **Cause:** Network outages, firewall misconfigurations, or DNS resolution issues.
- **Recovery:**

  1.  **Identify the network partition:** Use network diagnostic tools (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`, `netcat`) to determine the cause of the network connectivity issues.

  2.  **Resolve the network issue:** Fix the network outage, adjust firewall rules, or correct DNS configurations.

  3.  **Wait for the cluster to heal:** Once the network connectivity is restored, the nodes will automatically re-establish communication and reconcile their views of the cluster state. This may take some time, depending on the size of the cluster and the duration of the network partition.

  4.  **Run a repair:** After the cluster has healed, run a repair to ensure data consistency.

      ```plaintext
      nodetool repair -pr
      ```

## Best Practices for Cassandra Node Failure Recovery

- **Regular Backups:** Implement a regular backup strategy to protect your data against catastrophic failures. Use tools like `sstable2json` and `json2sstable` for logical backups, or consider using snapshot-based backups for faster recovery.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting to detect node failures and performance issues proactively.
- **Capacity Planning:** Ensure that your cluster has sufficient capacity to handle node failures without impacting performance.
- **Consistent Hashing:** Use a consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., Murmur3Partitioner) to distribute data evenly across the cluster and minimize the impact of node failures.
- **Replication Factor:** Choose an appropriate replication factor based on your availability requirements. A higher replication factor provides greater fault tolerance but also increases storage overhead.
- **Anti-Entropy Mechanisms:** Regularly run `nodetool repair` to ensure data consistency across the cluster.
- **Automated Failure Handling:** Implement automated scripts or orchestration tools to handle common failure scenarios. Consider using tools like Ansible or Chef to automate the recovery process.
- **Thorough Testing:** Test your failure recovery procedures regularly to ensure they are effective.
- **Use vnodes:** Virtual Nodes (vnodes) are enabled by default since Cassandra 1.2. They improve token distribution and simplify scaling and recovery. Avoid clusters without vnodes.
- **Understand Key Metrics:** Monitor key metrics such as:
  - **Pending Compactions:** High values indicate the system is struggling to keep up with writes.
  - **Read and Write Latency:** Increase may indicate a node problem.
  - **Dropped Mutations/Hints:** May mean that node is overwhelmed.
- **Use a Modern Cassandra Version:** Newer versions of Cassandra contain bug fixes, performance improvements, and enhanced failure recovery features. Upgrade regularly.

## Example: Automating Node Replacement with Ansible

Here's an example of how you might automate node replacement using Ansible:

```plaintext
---
- hosts: new_node
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Stop Cassandra if running
      service:
        name: cassandra
        state: stopped
      ignore_errors: yes # It's OK if Cassandra isn't running

    - name: Set replace_address in cassandra.yaml
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
        regexp: '^replace_address_first_boot:'
        line: 'replace_address_first_boot: {{ failed_node_ip }}'
        insertbefore: BOF # Ensure it's near the top for clarity

    - name: Start Cassandra
      service:
        name: cassandra
        state: started

- hosts: other_cassandra_nodes
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Run nodetool status to verify new node joined
      command: nodetool status
      register: nodetool_status_output
      until: "'UN' in nodetool_status_output.stdout"
      retries: 10
      delay: 30

- hosts: new_node
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Repair new node
      command: nodetool repair -pr
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`hosts: new_node`**: Targets the new Cassandra node that will replace the failed one.
2.  **`Set replace_address in cassandra.yaml`**: Modifies the `cassandra.yaml` file on the new node to set the `replace_address_first_boot` option to the IP address of the failed node (passed as a variable `failed_node_ip`).
3.  **`hosts: other_cassandra_nodes`**: Targets other nodes in the cluster.
4.  **`Run nodetool status to verify new node joined`**: Checks the output of `nodetool status` on the existing nodes until the new node shows up as "Up/Normal" ("UN").
5.  **`hosts: new_node`**: Targets the new node again.
6.  **`Repair new node`**: Runs `nodetool repair -pr` on the new node after it has joined the cluster.

## Conclusion

Recovering from Cassandra node failures requires a combination of careful planning, proactive monitoring, and well-defined recovery procedures. By understanding the underlying architecture of Cassandra, identifying potential failure modes, and implementing the best practices outlined in this guide, you can minimize downtime and ensure data consistency in your Cassandra cluster. Remember to test your recovery procedures regularly to ensure they are effective and to adapt them to your specific environment.
