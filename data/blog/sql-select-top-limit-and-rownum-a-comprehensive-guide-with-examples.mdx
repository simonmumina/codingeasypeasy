# SQL SELECT TOP, LIMIT, and ROWNUM: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

When working with large datasets, retrieving only the first few rows is a common requirement.  SQL provides different mechanisms for achieving this, depending on the specific database system you're using.  This post delves into the `SELECT TOP`, `LIMIT`, and `ROWNUM` clauses, providing a comprehensive guide to their usage, syntax variations, and practical examples.

## Introduction

Imagine you have a table containing millions of customer records and you want to quickly view the top 10 customers based on their purchase amount.  Retrieving all the data and then filtering it in your application code would be inefficient and time-consuming. SQL's top row selection features solve this problem by allowing you to restrict the number of rows returned directly within the query.

However, the specific keyword and syntax vary across different database systems (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle). This guide will cover the following:

*   **`SELECT TOP` (SQL Server and MS Access):**  How to retrieve the top *n* rows.
*   **`LIMIT` (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite):**  How to limit the result set to a specified number of rows.
*   **`ROWNUM` (Oracle):**  How to assign row numbers and filter based on them.

## `SELECT TOP` (SQL Server and MS Access)

The `SELECT TOP` clause is used in SQL Server and MS Access to specify the number of rows to return from a query.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT TOP number|percent column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

*   `number`: Specifies the number of rows to return.
*   `percent`: Specifies the percentage of rows to return.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a table called `Customers` with the following columns: `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, `City`, and `Country`.  We want to retrieve the top 5 customers from the table.

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 5 customers
SELECT TOP 5 CustomerID, CustomerName, City
FROM Customers;
```

This query will return the first 5 rows from the `Customers` table, regardless of any specific ordering.  To retrieve the top 5 customers based on a specific criteria (e.g., highest order value), you would need to use the `ORDER BY` clause in conjunction with `SELECT TOP`.

**Example with `ORDER BY`:**

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 5 customers with the highest order amount (assuming a column called 'OrderAmount' exists)
SELECT TOP 5 CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount
FROM Customers
ORDER BY OrderAmount DESC;
```

This query will first sort the `Customers` table based on the `OrderAmount` column in descending order (`DESC`) and then retrieve the top 5 rows.

**Using `PERCENT`:**

You can also use the `PERCENT` keyword to retrieve a specific percentage of rows.

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 50% of customers
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT CustomerID, CustomerName, City
FROM Customers;
```

This query will return approximately 50% of the rows from the `Customers` table.  The exact number of rows returned may vary slightly depending on the total number of rows in the table.

## `LIMIT` (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

The `LIMIT` clause is used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column1, column2, ...
LIMIT number;
```

*   `number`: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.

**Example:**

Using the same `Customers` table, let's retrieve the first 3 customers using `LIMIT`.

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 customers
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City
FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;
```

Similar to `SELECT TOP`,  `LIMIT` needs `ORDER BY` to return the top rows based on a specific column.

**Example with `ORDER BY`:**

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 customers with the highest order amount
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount
FROM Customers
ORDER BY OrderAmount DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

This query will sort the `Customers` table by `OrderAmount` in descending order and then return the first 3 rows.

**`LIMIT` with Offset (MySQL and PostgreSQL):**

`LIMIT` also supports an offset, allowing you to start retrieving rows from a specific position in the result set.  This is useful for pagination.

**MySQL Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column1, column2, ...
LIMIT offset, number;
```

*   `offset`: Specifies the starting row number (0-based).
*   `number`: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.

**PostgreSQL Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column1, column2, ...
LIMIT number OFFSET offset;
```

*   `number`: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
*   `offset`: Specifies the starting row number (0-based).

**Example (MySQL):**

```sql
-- Retrieve the 4th and 5th customers based on CustomerID
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City
FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerID
LIMIT 3, 2; -- Starting from row 3 (4th row), retrieve 2 rows.
```

**Example (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- Retrieve the 4th and 5th customers based on CustomerID
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City
FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerID
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3; -- Retrieve 2 rows, starting from row 3 (4th row).
```

## `ROWNUM` (Oracle)

`ROWNUM` is a pseudo-column in Oracle that assigns a number to each row returned by a query.  It's important to understand how `ROWNUM` works, as its behavior can be tricky.  `ROWNUM` is assigned *before* the `ORDER BY` clause is applied.

**Important Note:**  You **cannot** directly use `ROWNUM` with `WHERE` conditions that compare it to a value greater than 1 (e.g., `WHERE ROWNUM > 10`).  This is because `ROWNUM` is assigned sequentially as rows are retrieved. Once a row doesn't meet the condition, no further `ROWNUM` is assigned for subsequent rows in the result set.  Oracle processes the `WHERE` clause before assigning the ROWNUM.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ..., ROWNUM
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column1, column2, ...;
```

**Example (Incorrect):**

```sql
-- This will NOT work as expected!
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, ROWNUM
FROM Customers
WHERE ROWNUM > 1; -- This condition will not be satisfied after the first row is not selected.
```

**Correct Approach:**

To retrieve the top *n* rows using `ROWNUM`, you need to use a subquery.

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 5 customers with the highest order amount (CORRECT)
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount
FROM (
    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount
    FROM Customers
    ORDER BY OrderAmount DESC
)
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Inner Query:** The inner query `(SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount FROM Customers ORDER BY OrderAmount DESC)` selects and orders the data based on `OrderAmount` in descending order.  This is crucial for getting the correct ordering.
2.  **Outer Query:** The outer query `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount FROM (...) WHERE ROWNUM <= 5` selects the columns from the result of the inner query and filters it to retrieve only the rows where `ROWNUM` is less than or equal to 5.  The ROWNUM is assigned after the ordering in the subquery.

**Example to retrieve specific rows (like LIMIT OFFSET):**

To emulate the behavior of `LIMIT` with `OFFSET`, you need to use `ROWNUM` and subqueries even more carefully:

```sql
-- Retrieve rows 4 to 6 (inclusive)
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount
FROM (
    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount, ROWNUM AS rn
    FROM (
        SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount
        FROM Customers
        ORDER BY CustomerID -- Example order
    )
    WHERE ROWNUM <= 6  -- Filter to the end row number
)
WHERE rn >= 4; -- Filter to the start row number
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Innermost Query:** Selects the data and orders it. `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount FROM Customers ORDER BY CustomerID`
2.  **Middle Query:** Assigns the row number using `ROWNUM AS rn` and filters up to the desired "end" row (6 in this case). `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount, ROWNUM AS rn FROM (...) WHERE ROWNUM <= 6`  This is essential to get a contiguous `ROWNUM` sequence.
3.  **Outermost Query:** Filters the results from the middle query, using the assigned `rn` to select rows from the desired starting row (4 in this case) to the end row. `SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, City, OrderAmount FROM (...) WHERE rn >= 4`
