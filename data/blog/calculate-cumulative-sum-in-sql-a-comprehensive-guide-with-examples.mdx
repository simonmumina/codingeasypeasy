# Calculate Cumulative Sum in SQL: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The cumulative sum, also known as a running total, is a fundamental calculation in data analysis and reporting. It represents the sum of values up to a given point in a dataset. In SQL, calculating the cumulative sum can be achieved through various techniques, with window functions being the most efficient and modern approach.  This guide provides a comprehensive overview of calculating the cumulative sum in SQL, covering different methods and database systems with practical examples.

## What is a Cumulative Sum (Running Total)?

Imagine you have a table of daily sales. The cumulative sum for each day would be the total sales up to and including that day. This allows you to easily track the overall trend and growth of sales over time.  More formally, a cumulative sum is the sum of a sequence of numbers, where each term in the sequence is the sum of all previous terms in the original sequence, plus the current term.

## Why Calculate Cumulative Sums in SQL?

Calculating cumulative sums directly in SQL offers several advantages:

*   **Efficiency:**  SQL databases are optimized for data manipulation, making calculations performed directly within the database often faster than retrieving the raw data and performing calculations in a separate application.
*   **Data Consistency:** Calculations are performed on the data as it exists in the database, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
*   **Simplified Reporting:** Cumulative sums can be directly incorporated into reports and dashboards, simplifying data visualization and analysis.
*   **Real-time Analysis:** With appropriate database infrastructure, cumulative sums can be updated in real-time as new data arrives, providing up-to-date insights.

## Methods for Calculating Cumulative Sum in SQL

Several approaches can be used to calculate cumulative sums in SQL, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

1.  **Window Functions (OVER clause):** This is the most modern and recommended approach. It's efficient, readable, and widely supported across different database systems.
2.  **Subqueries:** This approach works by using a subquery to calculate the sum of values up to the current row. While functional, it can be less efficient than window functions, especially for large datasets.
3.  **Self-Joins (Correlated Subqueries):** This method involves joining the table to itself and using a correlated subquery to calculate the cumulative sum. It's generally less efficient and less readable than other methods.

## 1. Calculating Cumulative Sum using Window Functions (OVER clause)

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row.  The `OVER` clause defines the window of rows used for the calculation.  Here's the general syntax:

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    SUM(value_column) OVER (ORDER BY order_column) AS cumulative_sum
FROM
    table_name
ORDER BY
    order_column;
```

*   **`SUM(value_column)`:**  This is the aggregate function that calculates the sum of the `value_column`.
*   **`OVER (ORDER BY order_column)`:** This is the key part. It specifies that the `SUM` function should be calculated over a window of rows. The `ORDER BY order_column` clause determines the order in which the rows are processed for the cumulative sum calculation. The sum is calculated *up to and including* the current row, based on the specified order.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a table called `sales` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO sales (sale_date, amount) VALUES
('2024-01-01', 100.00),
('2024-01-02', 150.00),
('2024-01-03', 200.00),
('2024-01-04', 120.00),
('2024-01-05', 180.00);
```

To calculate the cumulative sum of sales by date, you would use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    sale_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_sales
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    sale_date;
```

**Result:**

| sale\_date   | amount | cumulative\_sales |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| 2024-01-01   | 100.00 | 100.00             |
| 2024-01-02   | 150.00 | 250.00             |
| 2024-01-03   | 200.00 | 450.00             |
| 2024-01-04   | 120.00 | 570.00             |
| 2024-01-05   | 180.00 | 750.00             |

### Partitioning the Cumulative Sum

You can also partition the cumulative sum by a specific column using the `PARTITION BY` clause within the `OVER` clause. This resets the cumulative sum for each distinct value in the partition column.

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    SUM(value_column) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column) AS cumulative_sum
FROM
    table_name
ORDER BY
    partition_column, order_column;
```

**Example:**

Let's say you have a table called `sales_by_region` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_by_region (
    sale_date DATE,
    region VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO sales_by_region (sale_date, region, amount) VALUES
('2024-01-01', 'North', 100.00),
('2024-01-02', 'North', 150.00),
('2024-01-01', 'South', 80.00),
('2024-01-02', 'South', 120.00),
('2024-01-03', 'North', 200.00),
('2024-01-03', 'South', 150.00);
```

To calculate the cumulative sum of sales for each region, you would use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
    sale_date,
    region,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_sales
FROM
    sales_by_region
ORDER BY
    region, sale_date;
```

**Result:**

| sale\_date   | region | amount | cumulative\_sales |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| 2024-01-01   | North  | 100.00 | 100.00             |
| 2024-01-02   | North  | 150.00 | 250.00             |
| 2024-01-03   | North  | 200.00 | 450.00             |
| 2024-01-01   | South  | 80.00  | 80.00              |
| 2024-01-02   | South  | 120.00 | 200.00             |
| 2024-01-03   | South  | 150.00 | 350.00             |

## 2. Calculating Cumulative Sum using Subqueries

This method uses a subquery to calculate the sum of values up to the current row.  It can be less efficient than window functions, especially for large datasets.

```sql
SELECT
    t1.column1,
    t1.column2,
    (SELECT SUM(t2.value_column)
     FROM table_name t2
     WHERE t2.order_column <= t1.order_column) AS cumulative_sum
FROM
    table_name t1
ORDER BY
    t1.order_column;
```

**Example (using the `sales` table):**

```sql
SELECT
    s1.sale_date,
    s1.amount,
    (SELECT SUM(s2.amount)
     FROM sales s2
     WHERE s2.sale_date <= s1.sale_date) AS cumulative_sales
FROM
    sales s1
ORDER BY
    s1.sale_date;
```

This query iterates through each row in the `sales` table (`s1`). For each row, the subquery calculates the sum of all `amount` values in the `sales` table (`s2`) where the `sale_date` is less than or equal to the current row's `sale_date`. This effectively calculates the cumulative sum up to that point.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Performance:**  Subqueries can be inefficient for large datasets because the subquery is executed for each row in the outer query.
*   **Readability:**  Subqueries can make the query harder to read and understand compared to window functions.

## 3. Calculating Cumulative Sum using Self-Joins (Correlated Subqueries) - Avoid if possible.

This method involves joining the table to itself and using a correlated subquery. It's generally the least efficient and least readable of the three options. We generally recommend avoiding this approach unless absolutely necessary.

```sql
SELECT
    t1.column1,
    t1.column2,
    SUM(t2.value_column)
FROM
    table_name t1
JOIN
    table_name t2 ON t2.order_column <= t1.order_column
GROUP BY
    t1.column1, t1.column2, t1.order_column
ORDER BY
    t1.order_column;
```

**Example (using the `sales` table):**

```sql
SELECT
    s1.sale_date,
    s1.amount,
    SUM(s2.amount) AS cumulative_sales
FROM
    sales s1
JOIN
    sales s2 ON s2.sale_date <= s1.sale_date
GROUP BY
    s1.sale_date, s1.amount
ORDER BY
    s1.sale_date;
```

This query joins the `sales` table to itself (`s1` and `s2`).  The `JOIN` condition `s2.sale_date <= s1.sale_date` ensures that for each row in `s1`, the join includes all rows in `s2` with a `sale_date` less than or equal to `s1`'s `sale_date`. The `SUM(s2.amount)` then calculates the sum of `amount` for these joined rows. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `s1.sale_date` and `s1.amount` to ensure the cumulative sum is calculated correctly for each date.

**Why avoid Self-Joins for Cumulative Sums?**

*   **Performance:** Self-joins are generally the least performant method for calculating cumulative sums, especially for large datasets. The join operation can be expensive.
*   **Readability:**  The logic behind the self-join can be harder to understand and maintain compared to window functions or subqueries.
*   **Complexity:**  Self-joins can lead to more complex queries, increasing the risk of errors and making the code harder to debug.

## Cumulative Sum in Different Database Systems

While the fundamental concepts remain the same, the specific syntax and features related to window functions may vary slightly between different database systems.

*   **MySQL:**  MySQL 8.0 and later fully support window functions, including the `OVER` clause.
*   **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL has excellent support for window functions.
*   **SQL Server:** SQL Server has robust support for window functions.
*   **Oracle:** Oracle supports window functions.
*   **SQLite:** SQLite version 3.25.0 (2018-09-15) and later support window functions.

**Example for SQLite (using the `sales` table):**

```sql
SELECT
    sale_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS cumulative_sales
FROM
    sales
ORDER BY
    sale_date;
```

## Optimizing Cumulative Sum Queries

*   **Indexes:**  Ensure that the column used for ordering (e.g., `sale_date`) has an index. This can significantly improve the performance of both window functions and subqueries.
*   **Data Types:** Use appropriate data types for numerical columns (e.g., `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`, `INT`) to avoid potential overflow issues.
*   **Partitioning (if applicable):**  If you are calculating cumulative sums for different groups (e.g., regions, categories), use the `PARTITION BY` clause to improve performance.
*   **Query Analyzer:**  Use the database's query analyzer to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the query plan.
*   **Window Functions (preferred):** Always prefer using window functions (OVER clause) over subqueries and self-joins for calculating cumulative sums. Window functions are generally the most efficient and readable option.
