# How to Publish Your Expo React Native App to the App Store & Google Play Store

So, you've built an amazing mobile application using Expo and React Native. Congratulations! Now comes the exciting (and sometimes daunting) part: publishing it to the app stores so the world can download and use it. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the process, covering both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have the following:

- **A finished and tested Expo app:** Your app should be feature-complete and thoroughly tested on both iOS and Android emulators/simulators and physical devices.
- **Expo account:** You'll need an Expo account to build and manage your app. If you don't have one, sign up at [https://expo.dev/](https://expo.dev/).
- **Apple Developer Program membership (for iOS):** You need to be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, which costs $99 per year. You can enroll at [https://developer.apple.com/](https://developer.apple.com/).
- **Google Play Developer Account (for Android):** You need a Google Play Developer account, which requires a one-time registration fee. You can create one at [https://play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console).
- **Node.js and npm/yarn installed:** You'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) to manage your project dependencies and run Expo CLI commands.

## Step 1: Configure Your App (app.json or app.config.js)

The `app.json` or `app.config.js` file (recommended for dynamic configuration) is the heart of your Expo app's configuration. It contains essential information about your app, such as its name, version, bundle identifier (iOS), and package name (Android).

Here's an example of `app.config.js`:

```plaintext
export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    name: 'My Awesome App',
    slug: 'my-awesome-app',
    version: '1.0.0',
    orientation: 'portrait',
    icon: './assets/icon.png',
    splash: {
      image: './assets/splash.png',
      resizeMode: 'contain',
      backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
    },
    updates: {
      fallbackToCacheTimeout: 0,
    },
    assetBundlePatterns: ['**/*'],
    ios: {
      supportsTablet: true,
      bundleIdentifier: 'com.yourcompany.myapp', //  Replace with your bundle identifier
      buildNumber: '1.0.0', // Important for submitting updates to the App Store
    },
    android: {
      adaptiveIcon: {
        foregroundImage: './assets/adaptive-icon.png',
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
      },
      package: 'com.yourcompany.myapp', // Replace with your package name
      versionCode: 1, // Important for submitting updates to the Play Store
    },
    web: {
      favicon: './assets/favicon.png',
    },
    extra: {
      eas: {
        projectId: 'YOUR_EAS_PROJECT_ID', // Get this from EAS after initializing your project
      },
    },
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- **`name`:** The name of your app that will appear on the home screen.
- **`slug`:** A URL-friendly name for your app.
- **`version`:** The version of your app. Increment this with each release.
- **`ios.bundleIdentifier`:** **This is crucial.** It's the unique identifier for your iOS app. Choose a reverse-domain name style (e.g., `com.yourcompany.myapp`). **Change `com.yourcompany.myapp` to your own identifier.**
- **`android.package`:** **This is also crucial.** The unique identifier for your Android app, following the same reverse-domain name convention. **Change `com.yourcompany.myapp` to your own identifier.**
- **`ios.buildNumber`:** A string representing the version number of the build. This number is specific to each build of the application. Increment with each build you upload to TestFlight or the App Store.
- **`android.versionCode`:** An integer representing the version of the application code. This number is used to determine whether one version is more recent than another. Increment with each upload to Google Play.
- **`extra.eas.projectId`:** This is obtained after setting up your project with EAS (Expo Application Services). We'll cover this in the EAS build process.
- **Assets (icon, splash, adaptiveIcon, favicon):** Make sure you have appropriate images in the specified locations. Expo provides excellent documentation on the required sizes and formats for each.

**Dynamic Configuration (app.config.js):** Using `app.config.js` allows you to dynamically generate configuration values based on environment variables or other factors. This is beneficial for managing different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

## Step 2: Set Up EAS (Expo Application Services)

EAS is Expo's cloud build service, and it simplifies the process of building and submitting your app to the app stores. It handles the complexities of building native binaries for iOS and Android.

1.  **Install EAS CLI:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install -g eas-cli
    ```

2.  **Login to EAS:**

    ```plaintext
    eas login
    ```

    Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Expo account.

3.  **Initialize EAS project:**

    ```plaintext
    eas init
    ```

    This command creates a new EAS project and links it to your Expo app. It will also ask you about your build configuration. Choose the defaults unless you have specific requirements. **Importantly, this will create a `eas.json` file in your project root directory.**

4.  **Get your EAS project ID:** After `eas init` completes, you will receive a `projectId`. Add this to your `app.config.js` file under the `extra.eas.projectId` property as shown in the example configuration.

## Step 3: Build Your App with EAS

Now that EAS is set up, you can build your app for either iOS or Android.

**Building for iOS:**

```plaintext
eas build -p ios
```

This command will start an iOS build in the cloud. You will be prompted to configure your Apple credentials. You'll need to provide your Apple Developer Program account information. EAS will guide you through the process of creating necessary certificates and provisioning profiles.

**Building for Android:**

```plaintext
eas build -p android
```

This command will start an Android build in the cloud. EAS will handle the keystore creation for you or you can provide an existing one.

**Important Build Options:**

- **`-p ios` or `-p android`:** Specifies the platform to build for.
- **`--profile <profile-name>`:** Allows you to specify a custom build profile defined in `eas.json`. Useful for different build configurations (e.g., development, staging, production).

**Monitoring the Build:** EAS CLI provides a link to track the build progress in your browser. You'll receive notifications when the build is complete.

## Step 4: Submit Your App to the App Store (iOS)

Once the iOS build is complete, you'll have an `.ipa` file ready to be submitted to the App Store.

1.  **Download the `.ipa` file:** Download the `.ipa` file from the EAS build details page.

2.  **Use Transporter or Xcode:** You can upload the `.ipa` file to App Store Connect using either:

    - **Transporter:** A free app from Apple specifically designed for uploading apps. It's available in the Mac App Store.
    - **Xcode:** If you have Xcode installed, you can use the Application Loader (accessible via Xcode's "Open Developer Tool" menu).

3.  **Create Your App Store Listing in App Store Connect:**

    - Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).
    - Go to "My Apps" and click the "+" button to create a new app.
    - Enter the required information:
      - **Platform:** iOS
      - **App Name:** The name of your app as it will appear in the App Store.
      - **Primary Language:** The primary language of your app.
      - **Bundle ID:** The `ios.bundleIdentifier` you set in your `app.config.js` file.
      - **SKU:** A unique identifier for your app (e.g., your company name followed by the app name).
      - **User Access:** Choose the access level for your app.
    - Click "Create."

4.  **Prepare Your App for Submission:**

    - **App Information:** Enter detailed information about your app, including:
      - **Category:** Choose the primary and secondary categories for your app.

5.  **Submit for Review:** Once you've filled out all the required information, click the "Submit for Review" button.

Apple's review process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Be prepared to address any issues or rejections that the reviewers might find.

## Step 5: Submit Your App to the Google Play Store (Android)

Once the Android build is complete, you'll have an `.apk` or `.aab` file ready to be submitted to the Google Play Store. The preferred format is now `.aab` (Android App Bundle) which allows Google Play to optimize the app for different devices.

1.  **Download the `.apk` or `.aab` file:** Download the file from the EAS build details page.

2.  **Create Your App in Google Play Console:**

    - Log in to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console).
    - Click "Create app."
    - Enter the required information:
      - **App name:** The name of your app.
      - **Default language:** The default language of your app.
      - **App or game:** Select whether your app is an app or a game.

      - **Screenshots:** High-quality screenshots of your app. Follow Google Play's screenshot guidelines.
      - **Video (optional):** A promotional video for your app.
      - **Category:** Choose the appropriate category for your app.
      - **Contact details:** Provide your website, email address, and phone number.

    - **Production Release:** This is where you upload your `.apk` or `.aab` file.

      - Go to "Production" in the left navigation.
      - Click "Create new release."
      - You may be prompted to set up signing if you have not already done so.
      - Upload your `.aab` (recommended) or `.apk` file.
      - Add release notes.

4.  **Submit for Review:** Once you've completed all the required information, click "Review release" and then "Start rollout to production."

Google Play's review process is generally faster than Apple's, often taking only a few hours. However, it's still important to monitor your app's status and address any issues that might arise.

## Step 6: Iterate and Update

Publishing your app is just the beginning. You'll likely need to release updates to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance. Follow the same build and submission process as outlined above for each update. **Remember to increment the `version` in `app.config.js` for both iOS and Android, as well as the `buildNumber` (iOS) and `versionCode` (Android).**

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Build errors:** Carefully review the error messages from EAS builds. Common causes include misconfigured credentials, missing dependencies, or issues with your app's code.
- **App Store rejections:** Pay close attention to Apple's review guidelines and address any violations identified by the reviewers. Common rejection reasons include incomplete information, misleading descriptions, and functionality issues.
- **Google Play rejections:** Similar to the App Store, carefully review Google Play's policies and address any violations. Ensure you provide correct data safety information.
- **Bundle identifier/package name conflicts:** Ensure that your `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` are unique and do not conflict with any existing apps.
- **Asset issues:** Make sure your icons, splash screens, and other assets are the correct size and format for each platform.
