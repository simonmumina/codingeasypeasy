# Organizing Large FastAPI Projects: Modular Routers for Scalable APIs

As your FastAPI project grows beyond a handful of endpoints, maintaining a single `main.py` file becomes increasingly challenging. This article dives into the best practices for organizing large FastAPI applications using modular routers. We'll explore how to break down your API into logical modules, making your code more readable, maintainable, and scalable.

## The Problem: Monolithic FastAPI Applications

Imagine an API with endpoints for user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment integrations, all defined within a single `main.py`. Such a setup leads to:

- **Reduced Readability:** A large file is difficult to navigate and understand.
- **Increased Complexity:** Debugging and adding new features becomes more complex.
- **Code Conflicts:** Multiple developers working on the same file can lead to conflicts.
- **Reduced Reusability:** Logic related to specific parts of the API might be difficult to reuse in other parts of the application or in other projects.
- **Testing Difficulties:** Unit testing individual components becomes more challenging.

## The Solution: Modular Routers

The solution is to modularize your FastAPI application using routers. Routers allow you to group related endpoints into separate modules, each handling a specific part of your API. This approach promotes separation of concerns and improves code organization.

## Project Structure

A well-defined project structure is crucial for a maintainable FastAPI application. Here's a recommended structure:

```
my_fastapi_project/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py       # Main application entry point
│   ├── dependencies.py # Dependency injection definitions
│   ├── models.py     # Pydantic models
│   ├── routers/      # Contains individual routers
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── users.py    # User management endpoints
│   │   ├── products.py  # Product catalog endpoints
│   │   ├── orders.py     # Order processing endpoints
│   │   └── payments.py   # Payment integrations endpoints
│   └── services/    # Business logic and data access
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── user_service.py
│       ├── product_service.py
│       └── ...
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conftest.py    # pytest configuration
│   ├── test_users.py
│   ├── test_products.py
│   └── ...
├── .env             # Environment variables
├── pyproject.toml   # Poetry (or requirements.txt)
├── README.md
```

**Explanation:**

- **`app/`:** The main application directory.
- **`app/main.py`:** The entry point for your FastAPI application. This file initializes the FastAPI app and includes the routers.
- **`app/dependencies.py`:** Contains dependency injection functions.
- **`app/models.py`:** Defines Pydantic models used for request and response data.
- **`app/routers/`:** A directory containing individual router modules. Each module handles a specific part of the API (e.g., users, products, orders).
- **`app/services/`:** (Optional) Contains business logic and data access logic, often separated from the API endpoints for better separation of concerns. This helps keep your routers "thin" and focused on routing and validation.
- **`tests/`:** Contains unit tests for your application.
- **`.env`:** Stores environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
- **`pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`):** Specifies the project's dependencies.
- **`README.md`:** Provides project documentation.

## Creating Routers

Let's create a simple example of a `users` router.

**`app/routers/users.py`:**

```plaintext
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Depends
from typing import List
from app.models import User  # Assuming you have a User model
from app.dependencies import get_db  # Assuming you have a get_db dependency

router = APIRouter(
    prefix="/users",
    tags=["users"],
    dependencies=[Depends(get_db)], # Optional dependencies for all routes in this router
    responses={404: {"description": "Not found"}},
)


@router.get("/", response_model=List[User], summary="Get all users")
async def read_users(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10):
    """
    Retrieve a list of users.
    """
    # Simulate fetching users from a database (replace with actual database logic)
    users = [
        User(id=1, name="Alice", email="alice@example.com"),
        User(id=2, name="Bob", email="bob@example.com"),
    ]
    return users[skip : skip + limit]


@router.get("/{user_id}", response_model=User, summary="Get user by ID")
async def read_user(user_id: int):
    """
    Retrieve a user by their ID.
    """
    # Simulate fetching a user from a database (replace with actual database logic)
    if user_id == 1:
        return User(id=1, name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
    elif user_id == 2:
        return User(id=2, name="Bob", email="bob@example.com")
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")


@router.post("/", response_model=User, summary="Create a new user")
async def create_user(user: User):
    """
    Create a new user.
    """
    # Simulate saving the user to a database (replace with actual database logic)
    user.id = 3  # Assign a mock ID
    return user


@router.put("/{user_id}", response_model=User, summary="Update an existing user")
async def update_user(user_id: int, user: User):
    """
    Update an existing user.
    """
    # Simulate updating the user in a database (replace with actual database logic)
    if user_id == user.id:
        return user
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="User ID mismatch")


@router.delete("/{user_id}", summary="Delete a user")
async def delete_user(user_id: int):
    """
    Delete a user.
    """
    # Simulate deleting the user from a database (replace with actual database logic)
    if user_id == 1 or user_id == 2:
      return {"message": f"User with id {user_id} deleted"}
    else:
      raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`APIRouter`:** We create an instance of `APIRouter` to group related endpoints.
- **`prefix`:** All routes defined within this router will have `/users` prepended to their path. For example, the `/` endpoint becomes `/users/`.
- **`tags`:** Used for documentation and grouping endpoints in the Swagger UI.
- **`dependencies`:** Defines dependencies that will be injected into all route functions within this router. This is useful for authentication, database connections, etc.
- **`responses`**: Defines common responses for all routes in this router, used for documentation.
- **`@router.get("/")`:** Defines a GET endpoint at the root of the router's prefix (i.e., `/users/`).
- **`@router.get("/{user_id}")`:** Defines a GET endpoint with a path parameter `user_id` (i.e., `/users/{user_id}`).
- **`response_model=User`**: Specifies the Pydantic model used to serialize the response data. This is essential for data validation and documentation.
- **`summary`**: Short, human-readable summary of the endpoint. Appears in the Swagger UI.
- **Docstrings**: Longer, more detailed description of the endpoint. Also appears in the Swagger UI.
- **Dependency Injection:** The `Depends(get_db)` tells FastAPI to inject the result of the `get_db` function into the route. The `get_db` function should handle creating and closing a database connection.

**`app/models.py`:**

```plaintext
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
```

**`app/dependencies.py`:**

```plaintext
from typing import Generator

# Simulate a database connection (replace with actual database logic)
def get_db() -> Generator:
    try:
        db = "Mock Database Connection" # Replace with your database connection logic
        yield db
    finally:
        print("Closing database connection") # Replace with your database closing logic

```

## Including Routers in the Main Application

Now, let's include the `users` router in the main application.

**`app/main.py`:**

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.routers import users, products, orders, payments  # Import all routers
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

app = FastAPI(
    title="My Awesome API",
    description="An API for managing users, products, orders, and payments.",
    version="0.1.0",
    terms_of_service="http://example.com/terms/",
    contact={
        "name": "API Support",
        "url": "http://example.com/support",
        "email": "support@example.com",
    },
    license_info={
        "name": "Apache 2.0",
        "url": "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html",
    },
)

# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
origins = [
    "http://localhost",
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "http://localhost:3000", # Allow your frontend to access the API
    "*", # Be careful with this in production. Allow only specific origins.
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)


# Include the routers
app.include_router(users.router)
app.include_router(products.router)
app.include_router(orders.router)
app.include_router(payments.router)


@app.get("/", include_in_schema=False)
async def docs_redirect():
    return RedirectResponse(url="/docs")

```

**Explanation:**

- **`from fastapi import FastAPI`:** Imports the `FastAPI` class.
- **`from app.routers import users, products, orders, payments`:** Imports all the router modules you've created. Ensure the `app/routers/__init__.py` file exists. If it doesn't exist, create an empty file in `app/routers/__init__.py` or explicitly import each module as `from app.routers.users import router as users_router`.
- **`app = FastAPI(...)`:** Creates an instance of the `FastAPI` application. The arguments allow you to customize the API documentation (Swagger UI).
- **`app.include_router(users.router)`:** Includes the `users` router in the application. FastAPI will automatically register all the routes defined in the `users` router. Repeat this for all your routers.
- **`CORSMiddleware`**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Adjust the `allow_origins` to match your frontend origins, especially in production. Setting `allow_origins=["*"]` is NOT recommended for production applications as it allows any origin to access your API.
- **`@app.get("/", include_in_schema=False)`**: Creates a root endpoint that redirects to the `/docs` endpoint, which serves the Swagger UI documentation. The `include_in_schema=False` argument prevents this endpoint from appearing in the API documentation.

**`app/routers/__init__.py`:**

```plaintext
# This file makes the 'routers' directory a Python package.
# You can optionally import the routers here for convenience.
# For example:
# from .users import router as users_router
# from .products import router as products_router
# Then, in main.py:
# app.include_router(users_router)
# app.include_router(products_router)

# or leave it empty and use individual imports in main.py

```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. This will start the server and automatically reload the application whenever you make changes.

- `uvicorn`: An ASGI server that runs FastAPI applications. You'll need to install it: `pip install uvicorn`.
- `app.main`: Specifies the module containing the FastAPI application (in this case, `app/main.py`).
- `app`: Specifies the FastAPI application instance (in this case, the `app` variable in `app/main.py`).
- `--reload`: Enables automatic reloading when you change the code. This is useful for development but should not be used in production.

## Benefits of Modular Routers

- **Improved Code Organization:** Makes your codebase more readable and maintainable.
- **Increased Reusability:** Routers can be reused in other parts of the application or in other projects.
- **Enhanced Scalability:** Makes it easier to scale the application by adding new routers as needed.
- **Simplified Testing:** Allows you to unit test individual routers in isolation.
- **Reduced Code Conflicts:** Multiple developers can work on different routers simultaneously without conflicts.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Routers Focused:** Each router should handle a specific area of the API.
- **Use Dependency Injection:** Use FastAPI's dependency injection system to inject dependencies into route functions.
- **Use Pydantic Models:** Use Pydantic models for request and response data validation.
- **Write Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to ensure that your routers are working correctly.
- **Document Your API:** Use FastAPI's automatic documentation generation to document your API.
- **Consider a Service Layer:** For complex logic, consider separating business logic into a separate "service layer" to keep your routers thin and focused on routing and validation. This improves testability and maintainability.

## Conclusion

Organizing your FastAPI project with modular routers is essential for building scalable and maintainable APIs. By breaking down your API into logical modules, you can improve code organization, increase reusability, and simplify testing. This guide provides a solid foundation for building large FastAPI applications with multiple routers. Remember to follow best practices and adapt the project structure to your specific needs. Good luck building amazing APIs!
