# How to Set WSL 2 as Default Version: A Comprehensive Guide for Windows Subsystem for Linux

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a powerful tool that allows developers to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the need for a virtual machine or dual boot setup. WSL 2, the newer version, offers significant performance improvements over WSL 1 thanks to its use of a lightweight virtual machine. This article provides a detailed guide on how to set WSL 2 as the default version, ensuring you benefit from the enhanced speed and features.

## Why Choose WSL 2?

Before diving into the how-to, let's briefly discuss why you should consider using WSL 2. Key advantages include:

*   **Improved File System Performance:** WSL 2 uses a virtualized ext4 file system, which significantly speeds up file I/O operations compared to WSL 1.
*   **Full System Call Compatibility:** WSL 2 supports a wider range of Linux applications, including those that rely on specific system calls not available in WSL 1.
*   **Docker Compatibility:** WSL 2 integrates seamlessly with Docker Desktop, providing a smoother and faster containerization experience.
*   **Kernel Updates:**  The Linux kernel used by WSL 2 is regularly updated by Microsoft, ensuring you have access to the latest features and security patches.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites met:

*   **Windows 10 version 1903 or higher (Build 18362 or later) or Windows 11:**  You can check your Windows version by pressing `Windows Key + R`, typing `winver`, and pressing Enter.
*   **Virtual Machine Platform feature enabled:** This is crucial for WSL 2 to function correctly.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Setting WSL 2 as Default

Here's a comprehensive guide to setting WSL 2 as your default WSL version:

### 1. Enable the Virtual Machine Platform Feature

If you haven't already, you need to enable the "Virtual Machine Platform" feature in Windows.

*   **Using the Control Panel:**
    *   Search for "Turn Windows features on or off" in the Start menu.
    *   In the "Windows Features" window, scroll down and check the box next to "Virtual Machine Platform".
    *   Click "OK" and restart your computer when prompted.

*   **Using PowerShell:**
    *   Open PowerShell as an administrator (right-click on the Start menu and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)").
    *   Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform -NoRestart
    ```

    *   Restart your computer after the command completes.

### 2. Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux Feature

If you haven't already, enable the WSL feature.

*   **Using the Control Panel:**
    *   Search for "Turn Windows features on or off" in the Start menu.
    *   In the "Windows Features" window, scroll down and check the box next to "Windows Subsystem for Linux".
    *   Click "OK" and restart your computer when prompted.

*   **Using PowerShell:**
    *   Open PowerShell as an administrator.
    *   Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux -NoRestart
    ```

    *   Restart your computer after the command completes.

### 3. Set WSL 2 as the Default Version

This is the key step.  You can set WSL 2 as the default version for future installations using the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

If the command is successful, you'll see a message indicating that WSL 2 is now the default version.

### 4. Verify the Default WSL Version

You can confirm the default WSL version with the following command:

```powershell
wsl --status
```

The output will show the default WSL version.  It should now display "Default Version: 2".

### 5. Converting Existing WSL Distributions to WSL 2 (If Applicable)

If you already have WSL distributions installed, they might be running on WSL 1. You can convert them to WSL 2 with the following steps:

*   **List your installed distributions:**

    ```powershell
    wsl --list --verbose
    ```

    This command will show you the name of each distribution and its current version (1 or 2).

*   **Convert a distribution to WSL 2:**

    Replace `<DistributionName>` with the actual name of the distribution you want to convert. For example, to convert Ubuntu, you would use `wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2`.

    ```powershell
    wsl --set-version <DistributionName> 2
    ```

    The conversion process can take some time, especially for large distributions, as it involves converting the file system.

*   **Verify the conversion:**

    After the conversion is complete, run `wsl --list --verbose` again to confirm that the distribution is now running on WSL 2.

### 6. Updating the WSL Kernel

It is highly recommended to update the WSL kernel to the latest version to take advantage of the latest features and improvements. Microsoft provides regular kernel updates via Windows Update.

*   **Check for Windows Updates:** Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and click "Check for updates."
*   **Alternatively, you can download the latest WSL kernel manually:**
    *   Visit the Microsoft documentation page ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/kernel-update](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/kernel-update) - Always check for the latest official link) for instructions and the download link.

### Example: Converting Ubuntu to WSL 2

Let's walk through an example of converting an existing Ubuntu distribution to WSL 2.

1.  **List distributions:**
    ```powershell
    wsl --list --verbose
    ```

    Assume the output shows:

    ```
      NAME            STATE           VERSION
    * Ubuntu          Running         1
    ```

2.  **Convert Ubuntu to WSL 2:**
    ```powershell
    wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
    ```

    This will start the conversion process.  You'll see a progress indicator.

3.  **Verify the conversion:**
    ```powershell
    wsl --list --verbose
    ```

    The output should now show:

    ```
      NAME            STATE           VERSION
    * Ubuntu          Running         2
    ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

*   **"WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component. For information please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel":** This error indicates that your WSL kernel is outdated. Follow the steps in section 6 to update the kernel.
*   **"The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation. Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse":**  This error usually occurs if your WSL distribution's virtual hard disk is compressed or encrypted.  You can try the following:

    *   **Check Disk Compression:** Right-click on the `ext4.vhdx` file for your distribution (usually located in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\<DistributionPackageName>\LocalState\`), select "Properties," click "Advanced," and uncheck "Compress contents to save disk space."
    *   **Check Encryption:** Ensure the disk is not encrypted by BitLocker or other encryption software.

*   **Slow Performance After Conversion:** Ensure that your files are stored within the WSL file system (e.g., `/home/<username>`) rather than on the Windows file system (e.g., `/mnt/c/`).  Accessing files on the Windows file system from WSL can be significantly slower.
*   **"There is no distribution with the supplied name":** Double-check the name of the distribution. It is case-sensitive. Use `wsl --list --verbose` to get the exact name.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily set WSL 2 as the default version and convert existing distributions to take advantage of its superior performance and features. This allows you to leverage the power of Linux directly within Windows, enhancing your development workflow and productivity.  Remember to keep your WSL kernel updated and troubleshoot any issues that may arise to ensure a smooth and efficient experience.  Happy coding!
