# How to Hide Apache Server Version in HTTP Headers for Enhanced Security

In today's digital landscape, security is paramount. One often-overlooked aspect of web server security is the information exposed in HTTP response headers. Specifically, the `Server` header often reveals the exact version of your Apache web server. This information can be valuable to attackers looking for known vulnerabilities in specific versions of Apache. Hiding this information is a crucial step in server hardening. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to hide your Apache server version, thereby improving your web server's security posture.

## Why Hide the Apache Server Version?

Revealing the Apache server version makes your server an easier target for attackers. They can quickly identify known vulnerabilities associated with that specific version and tailor their attacks accordingly. By hiding the version, you force attackers to expend more effort on reconnaissance, potentially deterring them altogether. This is known as "security through obscurity," and while it's not a foolproof solution on its own, it's a valuable layer of defense when combined with other security measures.

## Methods to Hide the Apache Server Version

There are several ways to hide the Apache server version in HTTP headers. We'll explore the most common and effective methods:

1.  **Modifying the `ServerTokens` and `ServerSignature` Directives**
2.  **Using `mod_security`**
3.  **Using a Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx)**

Let's delve into each method with detailed explanations and code examples.

### 1. Modifying the `ServerTokens` and `ServerSignature` Directives

This is the most common and straightforward method for hiding the Apache server version. It involves modifying the `ServerTokens` and `ServerSignature` directives in your Apache configuration file.

- **`ServerTokens`:** This directive controls how much information about the server is included in the `Server` response header.
- **`ServerSignature`:** This directive determines whether a line containing the server version and virtual host name is appended to server-generated documents (e.g., error pages).

**Steps:**

1.  **Locate the Apache Configuration File:** The location of your Apache configuration file varies depending on your operating system and distribution. Common locations include:

    - **Debian/Ubuntu:** `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`
    - **CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:** `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`
    - **FreeBSD:** `/usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf`

    Use the command `apachectl -V` to find the loaded configuration file. Look for the `SERVER_CONFIG_FILE` variable.

2.  **Edit the Configuration File:** Open the configuration file with a text editor that has root privileges (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf`).

3.  **Modify the `ServerTokens` Directive:** Find the `ServerTokens` directive. If it doesn't exist, add it. Set it to one of the following values:

    - **`Prod` or `ProductOnly`:** Only the product name (e.g., "Apache") is sent. This is the recommended setting for maximum security.
    - **`Major`:** Sends the product name and major version number (e.g., "Apache/2").
    - **`Minor`:** Sends the product name, major, and minor version numbers (e.g., "Apache/2.4").
    - **`Minimal`:** Sends the product name, major, minor, and patch version numbers (e.g., "Apache/2.4.38").
    - **`OS`:** Sends the information from `Minimal` and the operating system (e.g., "Apache/2.4.38 (Unix)").
    - **`Full` (or not specified):** Sends the full server version string (e.g., "Apache/2.4.38 (Unix) PHP/7.4.1"). **Avoid this setting!**

    Set `ServerTokens` to `Prod`:

    ```plaintext
    ServerTokens Prod
    ```

4.  **Modify the `ServerSignature` Directive:** Find the `ServerSignature` directive. If it doesn't exist, add it. Set it to `Off`:

    ```plaintext
    ServerSignature Off
    ```

5.  **Save the Changes and Restart Apache:** Save the configuration file and restart Apache for the changes to take effect. The command to restart Apache varies depending on your operating system:

    - **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo systemctl restart apache2`
    - **CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:** `sudo systemctl restart httpd`
    - **FreeBSD:** `sudo service apache24 restart`

6.  **Verify the Changes:** Use a tool like `curl` or an online HTTP header checker to verify that the `Server` header only shows "Apache" and that the server signature is no longer displayed in error pages.

    ```bash
    curl -I http://your-server-address
    ```

    The output should look something like this:

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Sat, 26 Oct 2024 10:00:00 GMT
    Server: Apache
    ...
    ```

### 2. Using `mod_security`

`mod_security` is a powerful web application firewall (WAF) that can be used to filter and modify HTTP headers, among other things. While more complex than simply modifying `ServerTokens` and `ServerSignature`, it provides more granular control.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install `mod_security`:** If `mod_security` is not already installed, install it using your operating system's package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2
    sudo a2enmod security2
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

    On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install mod_security
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

2.  **Configure `mod_security`:** `mod_security` rules are typically configured in `/etc/apache2/mods-available/security2.conf` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/mod_security.conf` (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora). You'll need to add a rule to remove the `Server` header.

    Add the following rule to your `mod_security` configuration file:

    ```plaintext
    <IfModule security2_module>
        SecRuleEngine On
        SecRuleRemoveById 300000 ; Remove the default ruleset's Server header masking

        <Location />
            SecRuleUpdateTargetByTag 'OWASP_CRS/WEB_SERVER' 'REQUEST_HEADERS:Server'
            SecRuleRemoveTargetByTag 'OWASP_CRS/WEB_SERVER' 'RESPONSE_HEADERS:Server'
        </Location>

        # Alternatively, remove the header directly (more aggressive)
        # Header always unset Server
    </IfModule>
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `SecRuleEngine On`: Enables the `mod_security` engine.
    - `SecRuleRemoveById 300000`: This is often needed if you have a default OWASP CRS ruleset enabled, as it may already be masking the Server header in a basic way. Removing this rule allows you to control the process.
    - `<Location />`: Applies the rules to all locations on the server. You can restrict this to specific virtual hosts or directories if needed.
    - `SecRuleUpdateTargetByTag 'OWASP_CRS/WEB_SERVER' 'REQUEST_HEADERS:Server'`: This is used for updating the existing Server tag.
    - `SecRuleRemoveTargetByTag 'OWASP_CRS/WEB_SERVER' 'RESPONSE_HEADERS:Server'`: This rule tells `mod_security` to remove the `Server` header from the response.
    - `Header always unset Server`: (Alternative) This directive in the Apache configuration removes the Server header regardless of whether it was set by the server or a module. It's more aggressive and might have unintended consequences if other parts of your application rely on the Server header (unlikely, but possible). Use with caution.

3.  **Restart Apache:** Restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2  # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo systemctl restart httpd   # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
    ```

4.  **Verify the Changes:** Use `curl` or an online HTTP header checker to verify that the `Server` header is no longer present.

    ```bash
    curl -I http://your-server-address
    ```

    The output should _not_ include the `Server` header.

### 3. Using a Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx)

A reverse proxy sits in front of your Apache server and handles incoming requests. You can configure the reverse proxy to modify the headers before passing them on to the client. This is a more complex solution but offers additional benefits such as load balancing, caching, and SSL termination. We'll use Nginx as the example reverse proxy.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Nginx:** If Nginx is not already installed, install it using your operating system's package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nginx
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    ```

    On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install nginx
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    ```

2.  **Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy:** Configure Nginx to forward requests to your Apache server. Edit the Nginx configuration file (usually `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`).

    Add or modify the `server` block to include the following:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your-server-address; # Replace with your server's address

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; # Replace with your Apache server's address and port if different
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

            # Remove the Server header from the response
            proxy_hide_header Server;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `listen 80`: Listens for HTTP requests on port 80.
    - `server_name your-server-address`: Sets the server name for this virtual host.
    - `proxy_pass http://localhost:8080`: Forwards requests to your Apache server running on localhost port 8080 (adjust as needed).
    - `proxy_set_header`: These directives pass information about the original request to the Apache server.
    - `proxy_hide_header Server`: This directive removes the `Server` header from the response before sending it to the client.

3.  **Configure Apache to Listen on a Different Port (Optional but Recommended):** If Nginx is acting as a reverse proxy on port 80, you should configure Apache to listen on a different port (e.g., 8080) to prevent direct access to Apache. Edit your Apache configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/ports.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`) and change the `Listen` directive:

    ```plaintext
    Listen 8080
    ```

    Also, update your virtual host configurations to listen on port 8080:

    ```plaintext
    <VirtualHost *:8080>
    ...
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

4.  **Restart Nginx and Apache:** Restart both Nginx and Apache for the changes to take effect.

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    sudo systemctl restart apache2  # Or sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

5.  **Verify the Changes:** Use `curl` or an online HTTP header checker to verify that the `Server` header is no longer present when accessing your server through Nginx.

    ```bash
    curl -I http://your-server-address
    ```

    The output should _not_ include the `Server` header.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Security in Depth:** Hiding the server version is just one aspect of server hardening. Ensure you also implement other security measures, such as keeping your software up to date, using strong passwords, and configuring a firewall.
- **Regular Updates:** Regularly update your Apache server and operating system to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your changes in a staging environment before applying them to a production server.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor your server logs for suspicious activity.
- **OWASP CRS:** Consider using the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) with `mod_security` for enhanced web application protection.
- **Compliance:** Be aware of any compliance requirements that may affect your security configuration.
