# How to Run Multiple Versions of Node.js Simultaneously: A Comprehensive Guide

As a Node.js developer, you'll inevitably encounter scenarios where you need to work with different Node.js versions. Legacy projects might require older versions, while new projects benefit from the latest features and performance improvements of newer releases. Constantly uninstalling and reinstalling Node.js is time-consuming and error-prone. Fortunately, several excellent tools exist to manage multiple Node.js versions seamlessly. This guide will explore three popular options: NVM (Node Version Manager), N, and Volta, providing detailed instructions and best practices for each.

## Why Use a Node.js Version Manager?

Before diving into the tools, let's reiterate why a version manager is essential for Node.js development:

- **Project Compatibility:** Different projects may require specific Node.js versions. Using a version manager ensures you can easily switch between versions without conflicts.
- **Testing and Debugging:** You might need to test your code against different Node.js versions to ensure compatibility and identify potential issues.
- **Avoiding System-Wide Changes:** Installing Node.js globally can lead to conflicts with other system-level dependencies. Version managers isolate Node.js versions within your user environment.
- **Simplified Updates:** Version managers streamline the process of installing, updating, and uninstalling Node.js versions.
- **Collaboration:** Ensures consistent environments across development teams by specifying required Node.js versions in project configurations.

## Option 1: NVM (Node Version Manager)

NVM is arguably the most popular Node.js version manager. It's a command-line tool that allows you to install, manage, and switch between multiple Node.js versions. It is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows (with `nvm-windows`).

### Installation

#### macOS & Linux

The recommended way to install NVM on macOS and Linux is using the install script. Open your terminal and run:

```plaintext
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

(Always check the NVM repository on GitHub for the latest version and installation instructions: [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

After running the script, you'll need to close and reopen your terminal or source your profile to load the NVM environment variables. The script usually adds the necessary lines to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` file. You can also manually source it:

```plaintext
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc or ~/.profile, depending on your shell
```

Verify that NVM is installed correctly by running:

```plaintext
nvm --version
```

This should output the NVM version number.

#### Windows

For Windows, use `nvm-windows`: [https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

Download the latest installer from the releases page. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. After installation, open a new command prompt or PowerShell window to start using NVM.

Verify the installation with:

```powershell
nvm --version
```

### Basic Usage

Here are some essential NVM commands:

- **Install a Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  nvm install node  # Install the latest version
  nvm install 20.10.0  # Install a specific version (e.g., 20.10.0)
  nvm install lts/*  # Install the latest LTS version
  ```

- **List installed Node.js versions:**

  ```plaintext
  nvm ls
  ```

- **Use a specific Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  nvm use 20.10.0
  ```

  This will switch the active Node.js version in the current terminal session.

- **Set a default Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  nvm alias default 20.10.0
  ```

  This sets the default version that will be used in new terminal sessions.

- **Use a version based on `.nvmrc` file**

  Create a `.nvmrc` file in your project root with the desired node version (e.g., `20.10.0`). Then, in the project directory, run:

  ```plaintext
  nvm use
  ```

  NVM will read the `.nvmrc` file and switch to the specified version, or install it if it's not already installed. This is the most robust way to ensure project-specific Node.js versions.

- **Uninstall a Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  nvm uninstall 20.10.0
  ```

### Example Workflow

1.  **Install NVM:** Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2.  **Install Node.js versions:**
    ```plaintext
    nvm install node  # Install latest
    nvm install 18    # Install the latest 18.x.x version
    nvm install 16.14.0  # Install a specific version
    ```
3.  **List installed versions:**
    ```plaintext
    nvm ls
    ```
    (Output might look like this: `* 20.10.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)` )
4.  **Switch between versions:**
    ```plaintext
    nvm use 18
    node -v  # Verify the version (should output v18.x.x)
    nvm use 16.14.0
    node -v  # Verify the version (should output v16.14.0)
    ```
5.  **Create `.nvmrc` in your project:** In your project directory:
    ```plaintext
    echo "20.10.0" > .nvmrc
    ```
6.  **Use the `.nvmrc` version:**
    ```plaintext
    nvm use
    node -v # Verify node version
    ```

### Pros of NVM

- **Widely Adopted:** NVM has a large community and extensive documentation.
- **Simple and Intuitive:** The command-line interface is easy to learn and use.
- **Support for `.nvmrc`:** Ensures project-specific Node.js versions.
- **Cross-Platform (Mostly):** Works well on macOS, Linux, and Windows (using `nvm-windows`).

### Cons of NVM

- **Shell-Specific:** Requires shell integration (sourcing scripts).
- **Manual Installation:** Requires manual installation of Node.js versions.
- **Windows Implementation:** `nvm-windows` is a separate project with slightly different behavior.

## Option 2: N

`n` is a simpler Node.js version manager, primarily for macOS and Linux. It offers a more streamlined installation process and a less verbose command-line interface. **Important:** `n` does _not_ support Windows.

### Installation

Install `n` globally using npm:

```plaintext
npm install -g n
```

Since this is a global installation, you may need to use `sudo` on some systems:

```plaintext
sudo npm install -g n
```

### Basic Usage

- **Install a Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  n latest  # Install the latest version
  n stable  # Install the latest stable version
  n 20.10.0  # Install a specific version
  ```

- **List installed Node.js versions:**

  ```plaintext
  n ls
  ```

- **Use a specific Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  n 20.10.0
  ```

  This will set the specified version as the active version and update the system's symbolic link to point to it.

- **Remove a Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  n rm 20.10.0
  ```

- **Remove all Node.js versions except the current one:**

  ```plaintext
  n prune
  ```

### Example Workflow

1.  **Install N:**
    ```plaintext
    sudo npm install -g n
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js versions:**
    ```plaintext
    n latest
    n 18
    n 16.14.0
    ```
3.  **List installed versions:**
    ```plaintext
    n ls
    ```
4.  **Switch between versions:**
    ```plaintext
    n 18
    node -v
    n 16.14.0
    node -v
    ```

### Pros of N

- **Simpler Installation:** Uses `npm` for installation.
- **Less Verbose:** More concise command-line interface.
- **Fast Switching:** Directly updates the system's symbolic link.

### Cons of N

- **Limited Features:** Fewer features compared to NVM.
- **No Windows Support:** Only works on macOS and Linux.
- **Global Installation:** Installs Node.js versions globally, which can lead to conflicts if not managed carefully.
- **Lacks Project-Specific Versioning:** No `.nvmrc` equivalent for automatic project version switching.

## Option 3: Volta

Volta is a relatively newer Node.js version manager that focuses on speed, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility. It uses a toolchain approach, managing not just Node.js but also npm, yarn, and other JavaScript tools.

### Installation

Volta can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows using its installer script.

#### macOS & Linux

```plaintext
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

#### Windows

Download and run the installer from the Volta website: [https://volta.sh/](https://volta.sh/)

After installation, you'll need to open a new terminal session.

Verify the installation with:

```plaintext
volta --version
```

### Basic Usage

- **Install a Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  volta install node@20.10.0  # Install a specific version
  volta install node@lts  # Install the latest LTS version
  ```

- **List installed Node.js versions:**

  ```plaintext
  volta list
  ```

- **Use a specific Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  volta use node@20.10.0
  ```

  This command sets the Node.js version for the current project and automatically updates the `package.json` file with the Volta configuration. You typically only need to run this _once_ per project.

- **Pin a Node.js version (Recommended):**

  ```plaintext
  volta pin node@20.10.0
  ```

  This creates or updates the `package.json` file with a `volta` section that specifies the required Node.js and package manager versions. This ensures that anyone working on the project will use the correct versions. This is the **recommended** approach for Volta.

- **Uninstall a Node.js version:**

  ```plaintext
  volta uninstall node@20.10.0
  ```

### Example Workflow

1.  **Install Volta:** Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2.  **Install Node.js versions (and automatically pin to the project):** Within your project directory:

    ```plaintext
    volta install node@20.10.0
    ```

    This installs Node.js 20.10.0 and adds the following to your `package.json`:

    ```plaintext
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "volta": {
        "node": "20.10.0"
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Verify the version:**

    ```plaintext
    node -v
    ```

    Volta automatically manages the active version based on the `package.json` configuration.

### Pros of Volta

- **Cross-Platform:** Works consistently on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Toolchain Management:** Manages Node.js, npm, yarn, and other tools.
- **Automatic Version Switching:** Automatically switches Node.js versions based on `package.json`.
- **Speed and Reliability:** Designed for performance and stability.
- **Pinning:** Ensures everyone on the team uses the exact same versions.

### Cons of Volta

- **Relatively New:** Smaller community compared to NVM.
- **Overhead:** Because it manages the _entire_ toolchain, there can be a slight overhead. However, this is usually negligible.

## Choosing the Right Tool

Here's a summary to help you decide which Node.js version manager is best for your needs:

- **NVM:** Best for users who want a well-established, widely supported tool with a simple command-line interface and project-specific versioning via `.nvmrc`. Good all-rounder.
- **N:** Suitable for macOS and Linux users who prefer a simpler, less verbose tool. Not recommended if you need project-specific versioning or Windows support.
- **Volta:** Ideal for teams that want a reliable, cross-platform solution with automatic version switching based on `package.json` and management of the entire JavaScript toolchain. Recommended for larger projects where consistency is paramount.

## Best Practices

- **Use Project-Specific Versioning:** Always use `.nvmrc` (with NVM) or `volta pin` (with Volta) to specify the Node.js version for your projects. This ensures consistency across environments and prevents unexpected issues.
- **Avoid Global Installations:** Whenever possible, install packages locally to your project using `npm install` or `yarn add`. This helps isolate dependencies and prevents conflicts.
- **Keep Your Tools Updated:** Regularly update your Node.js version managers and Node.js versions to benefit from the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements.
- **Document Your Environment:** Include instructions on how to set up the project environment (including Node.js version) in your project's README file.

## Conclusion

Managing multiple Node.js versions is crucial for modern JavaScript development. NVM, N, and Volta offer excellent solutions for this task. Choose the tool that best fits your needs and workflow, and follow the best practices to ensure a smooth and consistent development experience. By employing these tools effectively, you'll spend less time wrestling with environment configurations and more time building great applications.
