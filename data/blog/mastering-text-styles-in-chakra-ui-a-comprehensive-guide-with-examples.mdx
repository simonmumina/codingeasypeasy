# Mastering Text Styles in Chakra UI: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Chakra UI is a popular component library for React that provides a set of pre-built, accessible, and customizable components. One of its strengths lies in its robust theming capabilities, allowing you to easily manage and apply consistent styles across your application. This guide focuses specifically on **text styles** in Chakra UI, demonstrating how to use them effectively to create a cohesive and maintainable typography system.

## Why Use Text Styles in Chakra UI?

Directly applying styles to individual text elements (e.g., `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`) can lead to inconsistencies and make it difficult to maintain a unified design. Text styles in Chakra UI offer a better solution by:

- **Centralized Management:** Define text styles in your theme, ensuring consistency across your application.
- **Readability and Maintainability:** Using semantic names like `heading.1` or `body.small` improves code readability and makes it easier to update styles globally.
- **Theming Support:** Text styles seamlessly integrate with Chakra UI's theming system, allowing you to create light and dark modes or different themes with ease.
- **Reusability:** Easily apply pre-defined styles to any text element in your application.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** Reduces code duplication and promotes a more organized codebase.

## Understanding the Default Theme

Chakra UI comes with a default theme that includes a set of predefined text styles. While you can use these defaults, it's generally recommended to customize them to match your brand's identity. Here's a breakdown of how text styles are typically structured in the theme:

```plaintext
// Example of textStyles in a Chakra UI theme

const theme = {
  textStyles: {
    h1: {
      // Can also use a function to dynamically apply styles
      fontSize: ['2.5rem', '3rem', '3.5rem'], // Responsive font sizes
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      lineHeight: '1.2',
      letterSpacing: '-0.05em',
    },
    h2: {
      fontSize: ['2rem', '2.5rem', '3rem'],
      fontWeight: 'semibold',
      lineHeight: '1.3',
    },
    body: {
      fontSize: '1rem',
      lineHeight: '1.5',
    },
    // Add more styles as needed
  },
};

export default theme;
```

**Explanation:**

- `textStyles`: This is the key in the theme object where you define your custom text styles.
- `h1`, `h2`, `body`: These are just examples of semantic names. You can name them whatever you want, as long as it makes sense in your context. Think about _what_ the style is used for (e.g., `pageTitle`, `sectionHeader`, `paragraph`) rather than _how_ it looks (e.g., `boldLargeText`).
- `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`: These are standard CSS properties that control the appearance of the text.
- **Responsive Values:** Notice the use of arrays for `fontSize`. This is a powerful feature of Chakra UI that allows you to define different values for different screen sizes. Chakra UI uses its responsive breakpoints to automatically apply the correct value.

## Implementing Custom Text Styles

Now, let's walk through the process of creating and implementing custom text styles in your Chakra UI application.

**1. Extend the Theme:**

First, you'll need to extend the default Chakra UI theme. Create a `theme.js` (or similar) file in your project and use the `extendTheme` function:

```plaintext
// theme.js

import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const theme = extendTheme({
  textStyles: {
    heading1: {
      fontSize: ['3xl', '4xl', '5xl'], // Responsive font sizes
      fontWeight: 'extrabold',
      lineHeight: 'shorter',
      letterSpacing: 'tight',
      color: 'gray.900',
    },
    heading2: {
      fontSize: ['2xl', '3xl', '4xl'],
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      lineHeight: 'shorter',
      letterSpacing: 'tight',
      color: 'gray.800',
    },
    body1: {
      fontSize: ['md', 'lg'],
      lineHeight: 'tall',
      color: 'gray.700',
    },
    body2: {
      fontSize: 'sm',
      lineHeight: 'normal',
      color: 'gray.600',
    },
    // Example of using a function for dynamic styles based on props:
    highlightedText: (props) => ({
      fontSize: 'md',
      fontWeight: 'semibold',
      color: props.isError ? 'red.500' : 'blue.500',
    }),
  },
});

export default theme;
```

**2. Apply the Theme:**

Wrap your application with the `ChakraProvider` and pass your custom theme to it:

```plaintext
// _app.js (or your main app entry point)

import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import theme from '../theme'
import App from 'next/app' // If using Next.js

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

**3. Using the Text Styles:**

Now you can use your custom text styles in your components using the `sx` prop or the `useStyleConfig` hook.

**Using the `sx` prop (recommended):**

```plaintext
import { Box, Heading, Text } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Heading sx={{ textStyle: 'heading1' }}>This is a Level 1 Heading</Heading>
      <Text sx={{ textStyle: 'body1' }}>
        This is the main body text of my component. Notice how the text styles are applied using the
        sx prop.
      </Text>
      <Text sx={{ textStyle: 'body2' }}>This is secondary body text with a smaller font size.</Text>
      <Text sx={{ textStyle: 'highlightedText', isError: true }}>
        This text is highlighted and styled as an error.
      </Text>
      <Text sx={{ textStyle: 'highlightedText' }}>
        This text is highlighted with the default blue color.
      </Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- `sx={{ textStyle: 'heading1' }}`: This applies the `heading1` text style defined in your theme to the `Heading` component.
- `isError`: We're passing a prop `isError` to the `highlightedText` style. This is then used to dynamically determine the color of the text. This showcases how you can use props within your text styles to add flexibility.

**Using the `useStyleConfig` Hook (Less Common, for Component Styling):**

The `useStyleConfig` hook is generally used to style entire components, not just text elements. However, you _could_ use it to apply text styles within a component's styles. It's less common and less direct than using `sx`, so it's generally best to stick with `sx` for applying text styles.

```plaintext
// Example of creating a custom Text component with a default textStyle
import { Text, useStyleConfig } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const CustomText = (props) => {
  const { textStyle, ...rest } = props
  const styles = useStyleConfig('Text', { variant: textStyle })

  return <Text {...rest} __css={styles} />
}

export default CustomText
```

**Explanation of `useStyleConfig` (for completeness, but generally avoid for simple text styles):**

- The `useStyleConfig` hook retrieves the styles for a given component variant. In this case, we're assuming you've defined variants for the `Text` component that correspond to your text styles.
- The `__css` prop is used to apply the styles returned by `useStyleConfig`.

**Important Considerations for `useStyleConfig`:**

- You'd need to define component-level styles with variants in your theme. This is more complex than directly defining text styles and isn't the recommended approach for simple text styling.
- The `useStyleConfig` hook is better suited for styling _entire components_ (e.g., a custom button) rather than just individual text elements.

**Recommendation: Always prefer using the `sx` prop for applying text styles directly to components.** It's cleaner, more concise, and easier to understand. The `useStyleConfig` hook is more appropriate when you need to create reusable, styled components with more complex logic.

## Advanced Customization and Best Practices

- **Semantic Naming:** Choose names that reflect the purpose of the text style rather than its appearance. For example, `pageTitle` is better than `largeBoldText`.
- **Responsive Design:** Use arrays for property values to create responsive text styles that adapt to different screen sizes. Chakra UI intelligently handles breakpoints for you.
- **Theme Tokens:** Utilize Chakra UI's theme tokens (e.g., `colors`, `space`, `fonts`) to ensure consistency across your application. For example, use `color: 'gray.700'` instead of `color: '#4a5568'`.
- **Functions for Dynamic Styling:** As shown in the `highlightedText` example, you can use functions to dynamically apply styles based on props. This allows you to create more flexible and reusable text styles.
- **Testing:** Test your text styles across different screen sizes and browsers to ensure they look consistent and accessible.
- **Accessibility:** Consider accessibility when defining your text styles. Ensure that the contrast ratio between the text and background color is sufficient for users with visual impairments.

## Conclusion

Chakra UI's text styles provide a powerful and flexible way to manage typography in your React applications. By leveraging the theming system and following best practices, you can create a consistent, maintainable, and accessible design that enhances the user experience. Remember to prioritize semantic naming, responsive design, and accessibility to ensure that your text styles are both visually appealing and user-friendly.
