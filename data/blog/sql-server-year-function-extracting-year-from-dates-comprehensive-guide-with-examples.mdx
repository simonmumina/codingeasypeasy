# SQL Server YEAR() Function: Extracting Year from Dates - Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The SQL Server `YEAR()` function is a powerful and fundamental tool for working with date and time data. It allows you to extract the year portion from a date or datetime value, enabling you to perform calculations, filtering, and reporting based on the year. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the `YEAR()` function's syntax, usage, and various practical examples.

## Introduction to the SQL Server YEAR() Function

The `YEAR()` function is a built-in function in SQL Server (Transact-SQL - T-SQL) designed specifically to extract the year component from a datetime expression. It simplifies date-related operations and allows you to focus on the year part of the data without having to deal with the full date and time value.

## Syntax of the YEAR() Function

The syntax of the `YEAR()` function is straightforward:

```plaintext
YEAR ( date )
```

Where:

- `date`: This is an expression that can be resolved to a `date`, `datetime`, `datetime2`, `smalldatetime`, `datetimeoffset`, `varchar`, `nvarchar`, `char`, or `nchar` data type. The function will implicitly convert string values to dates if possible. It is crucial that the string is in a recognized date format.

**Return Value:**

The `YEAR()` function returns an integer representing the year of the specified date.

## Basic Usage Examples

Let's start with some basic examples to illustrate how the `YEAR()` function works.

**Example 1: Extracting the year from a specific date**

```plaintext
SELECT YEAR('2023-12-25');
-- Result: 2023
```

This query will return `2023` because that is the year of the date '2023-12-25'.

**Example 2: Extracting the year from the current date**

```plaintext
SELECT YEAR(GETDATE());
-- Result: (The current year, e.g., 2024)
```

This query uses the `GETDATE()` function to retrieve the current date and time and then extracts the year from it. The result will be the current year when the query is executed.

**Example 3: Extracting the year from a datetime value**

```plaintext
SELECT YEAR('2023-07-15 10:30:00');
-- Result: 2023
```

This demonstrates that the `YEAR()` function works equally well with datetime values, ignoring the time portion and only extracting the year.

## Using YEAR() with Table Data

The real power of the `YEAR()` function comes into play when working with data stored in tables. Let's assume you have a table called `Orders` with a column named `OrderDate` of type `datetime`.

```plaintext
-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderDate DATETIME,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerName) VALUES
(1, '2022-03-10', 'Alice Smith'),
(2, '2023-08-22', 'Bob Johnson'),
(3, '2022-11-05', 'Charlie Brown'),
(4, '2023-04-15', 'David Lee');
```

**Example 4: Selecting orders placed in a specific year**

```plaintext
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerName
FROM Orders
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2023;
```

This query retrieves all orders placed in the year 2023. The `YEAR(OrderDate)` function extracts the year from the `OrderDate` column, and the `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those records where the year is equal to 2023.

**Example 5: Grouping orders by year**

```plaintext
SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear, COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate)
ORDER BY OrderYear;
```

This query groups the orders by year and counts the number of orders placed in each year. The `YEAR(OrderDate)` function is used to extract the year, and the `GROUP BY` clause groups the results based on the extracted year. The `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of orders in each group. The results are then ordered by year. This allows you to see trends and patterns in your order data over time.

**Example 6: Selecting orders within a year range**

```plaintext
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerName
FROM Orders
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) BETWEEN 2022 AND 2023;
```

This query selects all orders where the year falls within the range of 2022 to 2023 (inclusive). The `BETWEEN` operator simplifies the comparison by checking if the year is within the specified range.

**Example 7: Combining YEAR() with other date functions**

You can combine `YEAR()` with other date functions like `MONTH()` and `DAY()` to perform more complex date-based filtering and calculations.

```plaintext
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerName
FROM Orders
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2023 AND MONTH(OrderDate) = 8;
```

This query selects all orders placed in August 2023. It combines the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions to filter the orders based on both the year and the month.

## Handling Null Values

It's important to consider how the `YEAR()` function handles null values. If the `date` argument is `NULL`, the `YEAR()` function will also return `NULL`.

**Example 8: Handling NULL OrderDate values**

First, let's add a NULL value to our `Orders` table.

```plaintext
INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerName) VALUES
(5, NULL, 'Eve Williams');
```

Now, let's see what happens when we use YEAR() on the `OrderDate` column:

```plaintext
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear, CustomerName
FROM Orders;
```

The result will show `NULL` in the `OrderYear` column for the row where `OrderDate` is `NULL`.

To handle `NULL` values, you can use the `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` functions to provide a default year value.

```plaintext
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, ISNULL(YEAR(OrderDate), 0) AS OrderYear, CustomerName
FROM Orders;

-- OR

SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, COALESCE(YEAR(OrderDate), 0) AS OrderYear, CustomerName
FROM Orders;
```

These queries will replace the `NULL` value with `0` (or any other value you specify) in the `OrderYear` column. This can be useful for reporting and calculations where you need a non-null value.

## Performance Considerations

While the `YEAR()` function is generally efficient, it's important to be mindful of its performance impact, especially when working with large datasets. Using `YEAR()` in the `WHERE` clause can sometimes prevent the query optimizer from using indexes effectively.

**Index Usage:**

If you frequently filter or group data based on the year, consider creating an index on the `YEAR(OrderDate)` expression or a computed column that stores the extracted year.

**Example of using a Computed Column:**

```plaintext
ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD OrderYear AS (YEAR(OrderDate));

CREATE INDEX IX_Orders_OrderYear ON Orders (OrderYear);
```

By creating an indexed computed column, you can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter or group by year.

**SARGable Queries:**

Try to write _SARGable_ queries (Search ARGument able) whenever possible. A SARGable query allows the database engine to use indexes for filtering. Using `YEAR()` directly in the `WHERE` clause often makes the query non-SARGable.

Instead of:

```plaintext
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2023;  --Potentially non-SARGable
```

Use:

```plaintext
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';  --SARGable
```

The second query, using a date range, is generally more efficient because it allows the database engine to use indexes on the `OrderDate` column directly.

## Best Practices

- **Understand Date Formats:** Ensure the `date` argument is in a recognizable date format, especially when dealing with string values. SQL Server can implicitly convert strings to dates, but only if the format is unambiguous.

- **Handle NULL Values:** Always consider how `NULL` values are handled and use `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` to provide default values if necessary.

- **Optimize Performance:** Be mindful of performance implications, especially when working with large datasets. Consider using indexed computed columns or rewriting queries to be SARGable.

- **Use Consistent Date Data Types:** Storing date and time information in appropriate data types (e.g., `datetime`, `date`, `datetime2`) is crucial for consistent and reliable results. Avoid storing dates as strings whenever possible.

## Conclusion

The SQL Server `YEAR()` function is a valuable tool for extracting the year component from date and datetime values. By understanding its syntax, usage, and best practices, you can effectively use it to perform date-based filtering, grouping, and calculations in your T-SQL queries. Remember to consider performance implications and handle `NULL` values appropriately to ensure accurate and efficient results. This guide provides a solid foundation for using the `YEAR()` function effectively in various scenarios.
