# How to Sign Your Git Commits: A Comprehensive Guide (GPG, SSH, S/MIME)

In today's development landscape, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of your code is paramount. Digitally signing your Git commits adds a crucial layer of security, verifying that the code you're pushing hasn't been tampered with and genuinely originates from you. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of signing Git commits using GPG, SSH, and S/MIME, covering everything from key generation to configuration and verification.

## Why Sign Your Git Commits?

Signing your Git commits offers several significant benefits:

*   **Authentication:** It verifies that the commit was made by you, the claimed author.
*   **Integrity:** It ensures that the commit hasn't been modified since it was signed. Any change, even a single character, will invalidate the signature.
*   **Trust:**  It builds trust with collaborators and open-source users, assuring them that your code is genuine.
*   **Compliance:** Some organizations mandate commit signing for regulatory or security reasons.
*   **Security:** It provides a stronger level of assurance against malicious actors injecting code into your repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Git:** The version control system. You should have a relatively recent version installed.
*   **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard):**  For GPG signing.  Download and install from [https://www.gnupg.org/](https://www.gnupg.org/)
*   **SSH:**  For SSH signing (usually comes pre-installed on Linux and macOS).
*   **S/MIME (optional):** For S/MIME signing. You will need a valid S/MIME certificate.

## Method 1: Signing Git Commits with GPG

GPG is the most widely used method for signing Git commits. It relies on public-key cryptography.

### Step 1: Generate a GPG Key

If you don't already have one, generate a new GPG key. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

Follow the prompts, choosing the appropriate key type (RSA and RSA is generally recommended), key size (at least 4096 bits), and expiry date (you can choose to have no expiry date, but setting one is generally considered good practice).  Enter your real name and email address carefully as these will be associated with the key.  Finally, enter a strong passphrase to protect your private key.

**Important:** Keep your passphrase safe! If you lose it, you won't be able to sign commits using that key.

### Step 2: List Your GPG Keys

Once the key is generated, list your GPG keys to find the key ID:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format long
```

Look for the `sec` line (for "secret key") and copy the long key ID, which typically looks like `sec   rsa4096/YOUR_KEY_ID ...`.  You will need this key ID to configure Git. Example: `sec   rsa4096/3AA5C3437156722B 2016-03-10 [SC]` -> in this example, `3AA5C3437156722B` is the key ID.

### Step 3: Configure Git to Use Your GPG Key

Tell Git which GPG key to use for signing:

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_KEY_ID` with the actual key ID you copied in the previous step.

You can also configure Git to automatically sign all commits:

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Alternatively, you can sign commits individually using the `-S` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -S -m "Your commit message"
```

### Step 4: Configure Git to Use GPG Command

Sometimes Git cannot correctly identify the correct GPG executable. You might need to specify the full path to the `gpg` executable:

```bash
git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)
```

### Step 5:  Export Your Public Key

To allow others to verify your signatures, you need to export your public key and share it with them (e.g., on GitHub or other platforms).

```bash
gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID
```

This will output your public key in ASCII-armored format (a text representation). You can then copy this output and paste it onto platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

### Step 6:  Adding your GPG key to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

* **GitHub:** Go to your GitHub profile settings, then "SSH and GPG keys," and click "New GPG key." Paste your public key into the text box and click "Add GPG key."

* **GitLab:** Go to your GitLab profile settings, then "GPG Keys." Paste your public key into the text box and click "Add key."

* **Bitbucket:**  Go to your Bitbucket settings, then "Security," and click "GPG keys." Click "Add key," paste your public key into the text box, and click "Add key."

### Step 7:  Test Your Setup

Make a commit and check if it's signed:

```bash
git commit -S -m "Test commit with GPG signing"
git log --show-signature
```

The `git log --show-signature` command will display information about the signature, including whether it's "Good signature" or "Bad signature."  If it's "Bad signature," double-check your configuration and ensure your GPG key is trusted.  Also, ensure that the email address associated with your GPG key matches the email address configured in your Git settings (`git config user.email`).

## Method 2: Signing Git Commits with SSH

Since Git 2.34, SSH can be used for signing commits. This is particularly useful if you're already using SSH for authentication.

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key (if you don't have one)

If you don't already have an SSH key pair, generate one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Choose a strong passphrase when prompted.

### Step 2: Add Your SSH Key to Your SSH Agent

Make sure your SSH key is added to your SSH agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"  # Start the SSH agent if it's not already running
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # or the path to your private key
```

### Step 3: Configure Git to Use Your SSH Key

```bash
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey $(ssh-keygen -l -E sha256 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 | awk '{print $2}') # Replace ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 with your private key path
```

Or, if you want to use the default key:

```bash
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey $(ssh-keygen -l -E sha256 | awk '{print $2}')
```

### Step 4: Enable SSH Signing

To enable SSH signing, you need to set the `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` setting.  This file will contain a list of allowed SSH keys that can be used for signing. Create the file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
```

Now, add your public key to the `~/.ssh/allowed_signers` file.  The format of each line in the file is:

```
<key_id> <comment>
```

Where `<key_id>` is the SSH public key in base64 format and `<comment>` is a comment describing the key (usually your email address).

You can get the key ID and comment with:

```bash
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # Replace ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 with your private key path
```

The output will look something like:

```
256 SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx your_email@example.com (ED25519)
```

Add the SHA256 hash and the comment to the `~/.ssh/allowed_signers` file:

```bash
echo "SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx your_email@example.com" >> ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
```

Finally, configure Git to use the `allowed_signers` file:

```bash
git config --global gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
```

### Step 5: Sign Your Commits

You can now sign your commits with the `-S` flag:

```bash
git commit -S -m "Commit signed with SSH"
```

Or enable auto-signing:

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

### Step 6: Verify Your Signature

To verify the signature, use:

```bash
git log --show-signature
```

This will show the signature information.

### Step 7:  Sharing your public key
You'll need to share your SSH public key with collaborators so they can verify your commits.  This is often done through a project's documentation, a website, or other shared location. You will also need to add your key to platforms like GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket to get the "Verified" badge.  The process is similar to adding a GPG key.

## Method 3: Signing Git Commits with S/MIME

S/MIME is another option for signing Git commits, particularly useful if your organization already uses S/MIME certificates for email encryption and digital signatures.

### Step 1: Obtain an S/MIME Certificate

You'll need to obtain an S/MIME certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) or your organization's IT department.

### Step 2: Install the Certificate

Install the certificate on your system. The installation process varies depending on your operating system and email client.

### Step 3: Configure Git to Use Your S/MIME Certificate

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey "Your S/MIME Certificate Subject"
git config --global gpg.program openssl
```

Replace `"Your S/MIME Certificate Subject"` with the subject of your S/MIME certificate. You can find this using openssl.

### Step 4: Sign Your Commits

Sign your commits using the `-S` flag:

```bash
git commit -S -m "Commit signed with S/MIME"
```

Or enable auto-signing:

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

### Step 5: Verify Your Signature

To verify the signature, use:

```bash
git log --show-signature
```

### Step 6: Export and Distribute Your Certificate

For others to verify your S/MIME signatures, you need to provide them with your certificate. You can export your certificate from your email client and share it. They will need to import your certificate into their trust store.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions:

*   **"gpg: signing failed: No secret key":**  Make sure your GPG key is in your keyring and that you've configured Git to use the correct key ID.  Also, ensure that your GPG agent is running (`eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon)"`).
*   **"gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device":** This can happen on macOS.  Try restarting your GPG agent: `gpgconf --kill gpg-agent` and `eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon)"`.
*   **"error: gpg failed to sign the data":** Double-check that the email address associated with your GPG key matches the email address configured in your Git settings.  You can check your Git email with `git config user.email`. You can change your GPG key's email if needed.
*   **Commit signatures not verified on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:**  Make sure you've added your public key to the platform and that the email address associated with your GPG key matches the email address associated with your account on the platform.  Also, make sure your clock is accurate.
*   **"error: invalid format: /dev/null":** This error can occur when git is configured to sign, but no signing key is set.  Make sure you have a valid signing key and that you have properly configured `user.signingkey` in your git config.
*   **Using multiple signing methods at once:** Ensure you are only configuring **one** signing method (GPG, SSH, or S/MIME) and that configurations are correct.
