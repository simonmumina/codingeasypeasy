# NGINX Server Block (Virtual Host) Setup: A Comprehensive Guide

NGINX is a powerful and versatile web server often used for hosting websites and applications. A key feature of NGINX is its ability to host multiple websites on a single server using server blocks, also known as virtual hosts.  This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a basic NGINX server block.

## What are NGINX Server Blocks (Virtual Hosts)?

Think of server blocks (or virtual hosts) as individual websites configured within a single NGINX instance. Each server block listens for requests to a specific domain name or IP address and serves the corresponding website. This allows you to run multiple websites from a single server without requiring separate server installations for each. This significantly simplifies server management and can be much more cost-effective.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **A Linux Server:** (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS) with NGINX installed.  If you haven't installed NGINX yet, follow the instructions for your specific distribution.  For Ubuntu/Debian, you can use:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx
    ```

*   **A Domain Name:**  You need a domain name pointed to your server's IP address.  This is crucial for NGINX to know which server block to use when a request comes in. Update your DNS records (usually through your domain registrar) to point your domain to your server's public IP address.

*   **Basic Command Line Knowledge:** Familiarity with the command line is essential for navigating the file system and editing configuration files.

## Step 1: Create the Document Root Directory

The document root is the directory where your website files will be stored.  For each server block, we create a dedicated directory.  Let's say we're setting up a server block for the domain `example.com`.

1.  **Create the Directory:**

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
    ```

    This command creates the directory `/var/www/example.com/html`.  The `-p` flag ensures that parent directories are created if they don't already exist. The `/var/www/` directory is a common convention for storing website files.

2.  **Change Ownership:**  It's crucial to set the correct ownership for the directory so that your user account can upload files. Replace `your_username` with your actual username:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R your_username:www-data /var/www/example.com/html
    ```

    This command changes the ownership of the directory and its contents to your username and the `www-data` group (the default group for the NGINX process).  The `-R` flag applies the changes recursively to all subdirectories and files.

3.  **Set Permissions:** Setting correct permissions enhances security.

    ```bash
    sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/example.com/html
    ```

    This sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner (your username) and read and execute permissions for the group and others.

4.  **Create a Test `index.html` File:**  Create a simple `index.html` file to test your server block later:

    ```bash
    nano /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
    ```

    Paste the following HTML code into the file:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to example.com!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success! The example.com server block is working!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    Save the file (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter in `nano`).

## Step 2: Create the NGINX Server Block Configuration File

NGINX stores its server block configurations in files within the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory (or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` for some distributions – we will use the former).

1.  **Create a Configuration File:**  Create a new configuration file for your domain:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf
    ```

2.  **Paste the Configuration:**  Paste the following configuration into the file.  Modify it to match your domain name and document root:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name example.com www.example.com;

        root /var/www/example.com/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation of the Configuration:**

    *   `listen 80;` and `listen [::]:80;`: This tells NGINX to listen for HTTP requests on port 80 (the standard HTTP port) for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
    *   `server_name example.com www.example.com;`:  This specifies the domain names that this server block will handle.  List all the domain names or subdomains that should be served by this block, separated by spaces.
    *   `root /var/www/example.com/html;`: This sets the document root directory for this server block.  This is where NGINX will look for files to serve.
    *   `index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;`:  This specifies the order in which NGINX should look for index files (default files to serve when a directory is requested).
    *   `location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; }`:  This is a basic configuration for handling requests within the document root. It attempts to serve the requested file or directory. If the file or directory doesn't exist, it returns a 404 error.

    Save the file (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter in `nano`).

## Step 3: Enable the Server Block and Restart NGINX

1.  **Test the Configuration:** Always test your NGINX configuration for syntax errors before restarting the server:

    ```bash
    sudo nginx -t
    ```

    If the configuration is valid, you'll see output similar to:

    ```
    nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
    nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
    ```

    If there are errors, carefully review your configuration file and correct them.

2.  **Restart NGINX:**  Restart the NGINX service to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

## Step 4:  Test Your Server Block

1.  **Access Your Website:** Open a web browser and navigate to your domain name (e.g., `http://example.com`).  You should see the "Welcome to example.com!" message from the `index.html` file you created.

    If you *don't* see your website, double-check the following:

    *   **DNS Propagation:** It can take some time (up to 48 hours, but often much quicker) for DNS changes to propagate across the internet.
    *   **Server Block Configuration:** Ensure your `server_name` is correct in the NGINX configuration file.
    *   **Firewall:** Make sure your server's firewall is configured to allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP).

## Step 5: Setting up HTTPS (SSL/TLS) with Let's Encrypt

Serving your website over HTTPS (SSL/TLS) is crucial for security. Let's Encrypt provides free SSL/TLS certificates.

1.  **Install Certbot:**  Certbot is the recommended tool for obtaining and installing Let's Encrypt certificates. Install it using your distribution's package manager. For Ubuntu/Debian:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

2.  **Run Certbot:**  Run Certbot to obtain and install the certificate:

    ```bash
    sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
    ```

    Certbot will automatically configure your NGINX server block to use the certificate.  It will prompt you to answer a few questions, such as agreeing to the terms of service and providing an email address. It will also ask if you want to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS – it's generally a good idea to choose "yes".

3.  **Verify HTTPS:** After Certbot finishes, access your website using `https://example.com`. You should see the website served over HTTPS, and your browser should indicate a secure connection.

4.  **Auto-Renewal:** Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Certbot automatically sets up a cron job to renew your certificates automatically. You can test the renewal process with:

    ```bash
    sudo certbot renew --dry-run
    ```

## Example:  A more complex Server Block configuration

This example adds some extra configuration options such as serving static files and preventing direct access to certain directories.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name example.com www.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;  # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/example.com/html;
    index index.html index.htm;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location /static/ {
        # Serve static files directly without passing to PHP
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        # Deny access to .htaccess files
        deny all;
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the additional lines:**

*   `return 301 https://$host$request_uri;`:  This redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. `301` is a permanent redirect, which is good for SEO.
*   `listen 443 ssl http2;` and `listen [::]:443 ssl http2;`: These lines enable HTTPS on port 443 (the standard HTTPS port) and enable HTTP/2 for faster performance.
*   `ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;` and `ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;`: These specify the paths to the SSL certificate and private key obtained from Let's Encrypt.
*   `include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;`: This includes recommended SSL/TLS configuration settings from Let's Encrypt for better security.
*   `ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;`: This specifies the path to a Diffie-Hellman parameter file, which enhances security.
*   `location /static/ { ... }`:  This block configures how NGINX serves static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) located in the `/static/` directory.  `expires 30d;` sets the cache expiry time to 30 days, and `add_header Cache-Control "public";` tells browsers to cache the files.
*   `location ~ /\.ht { ... }`: This block denies access to files starting with `.ht` (like `.htaccess`), preventing attackers from potentially exploiting server configuration vulnerabilities.

## Troubleshooting

*   **502 Bad Gateway:** This usually indicates a problem with the backend application server (e.g., PHP-FPM if you are using PHP). Check the application server logs for errors.
*   **403 Forbidden:** This usually indicates a permission issue. Double-check the ownership and permissions of your document root directory and files.
*   **404 Not Found:** This usually indicates that the requested file or directory does not exist, or that the `root` directive in your server block is incorrect.
*   **"Welcome to NGINX!" Page:** If you're still seeing the default NGINX page, it means that your server block is not being processed correctly. Double-check the `server_name` and ensure that the default server block (if any) is disabled or removed. Use `sudo nginx -T` to dump the complete configuration, which can often help diagnose issues.

## Conclusion
