# Deploying Web2py to Production: A Comprehensive Guide

Web2py is a full-stack Python web framework that aims for easy development and security. While it's great for rapid prototyping and development, deploying a Web2py application to a production environment requires careful configuration to ensure performance, security, and stability. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps and considerations for a successful Web2py production deployment.

## Understanding the Production Environment

Before diving into the configuration, it's crucial to understand the key components of a typical production environment:

- **Web Server (Nginx, Apache):** Handles incoming HTTP requests and serves static files (images, CSS, JavaScript). It also acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding dynamic requests to the application server.
- **Application Server (uWSGI, Gunicorn):** Executes the Web2py application code. It receives requests from the web server, processes them, and sends back the response.
- **Database Server (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite):** Stores and manages the application's data. (This guide won't cover database server setup, but you should make sure your database server is properly configured and secured for production.)
- **Operating System (Linux):** The underlying platform for running the web server, application server, and database server. Linux is the most common choice for production environments due to its stability and performance.

## General Production Considerations

Regardless of the specific deployment method you choose, keep the following points in mind:

- **Security:** Implement HTTPS using Let's Encrypt or a commercial SSL certificate. Regularly update your operating system, web server, application server, and Web2py framework to patch security vulnerabilities. Configure firewalls to restrict access to necessary ports only.
- **Performance:** Optimize your Web2py application code for speed. Use caching techniques (both server-side and client-side). Configure your web server and application server for optimal performance.
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools to track server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) and application performance (response times, error rates). This allows you to identify and address issues before they impact users.
- **Logging:** Configure comprehensive logging to track application activity, errors, and security events. This is crucial for debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Backups:** Regularly back up your database and application code to protect against data loss. Automate the backup process to ensure consistency.
- **Virtual Environment:** Isolate your Web2py application's dependencies using a Python virtual environment. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects on the server.

## Deployment Methods: WSGI, uWSGI, and Gunicorn

Web2py applications can be deployed using different application server technologies. The most common approaches are WSGI, uWSGI, and Gunicorn.

### 1. WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)

WSGI is a standard interface between web servers and Python web applications. It allows you to run your Web2py application with web servers like Apache or Nginx using a WSGI module.

**Example with Apache:**

1.  **Install Apache and mod_wsgi:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
    ```

2.  **Create a WSGI file (e.g., `web2py.wsgi`) in your Web2py application directory (e.g., `/var/www/web2py`):**

    ```plaintext
    import os
    import sys

    # Add Web2py to the Python path
    web2py_path = '/var/www/web2py'  # Change this to your Web2py directory
    if web2py_path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(web2py_path)

    # Set the web2py environment variable (important!)
    os.environ['WEB2PY_PATH'] = web2py_path

    from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
    from web2py.wsgihandler import application

    def main():
      CGIHandler().run(application)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
    ```

    **Important:** Replace `/var/www/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py directory. The `os.environ['WEB2PY_PATH']` line is crucial for Web2py to find its libraries and configurations.

3.  **Configure Apache:**

    Create a new Apache configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/sites-available/web2py.conf`):

    ```plaintext
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName yourdomain.com  # Replace with your domain name
        ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com # Optional

        DocumentRoot /var/www/web2py/welcome/static  # Serve static files

        <Directory /var/www/web2py/welcome/static>
            Require all granted
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        </Directory>

        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/web2py/web2py.wsgi
        <Directory /var/www/web2py>
            <Files web2py.wsgi>
                Require all granted
            </Files>
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

    **Important:**

    - Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
    - Update `/var/www/web2py` to your Web2py installation directory.
    - The `DocumentRoot` points to the `static` folder of the `welcome` app. You might need to adjust this if you're using a different default app or serving static files from a different location.
    - The `WSGIScriptAlias` directive tells Apache to handle all requests through the WSGI script.

4.  **Enable the site and restart Apache:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo a2ensite web2py.conf
    sudo a2enmod wsgi
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

5.  **Consider using HTTPS (recommended). You can configure Let's Encrypt with Certbot:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
    sudo certbot --apache -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
    ```

    Certbot will automatically configure Apache for HTTPS.

**WSGI Advantages:**

- Simple to set up.
- Widely supported.

**WSGI Disadvantages:**

- Can be less performant than uWSGI or Gunicorn, especially under heavy load.
- Relies on the web server's process management, which might not be as efficient for Python applications.

### 2. uWSGI

uWSGI is a fast and efficient application server designed for Python applications. It's a popular choice for Web2py deployments due to its performance and flexibility.

**Steps for using uWSGI with Nginx:**

1.  **Install uWSGI and Nginx:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip nginx
    pip3 install uwsgi
    ```

2.  **Create a uWSGI configuration file (e.g., `uwsgi.ini`) in your Web2py application directory (e.g., `/var/www/web2py`):**

    ```plaintext
    [uwsgi]
    module = web2py.wsgihandler
    chdir = /var/www/web2py
    wsgi-file = /var/www/web2py/web2py.py
    callable = application
    processes = 4  # Adjust based on your server's CPU cores
    threads = 2    # Adjust based on your server's CPU cores
    socket = /var/www/web2py/web2py.sock
    chmod-socket = 660
    vacuum = true
    env = WEB2PY_PATH=/var/www/web2py
    logto = /var/log/uwsgi/web2py.log
    ```

    **Important:**

    - Replace `/var/www/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py directory.
    - `processes` and `threads` should be adjusted based on your server's CPU resources. A good starting point is to set `processes` to the number of CPU cores and `threads` to 2-4.
    - `socket` defines the Unix socket that uWSGI will listen on.

3.  **Create a systemd service file (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/web2py.service`):**

    ```plaintext
    [Unit]
    Description=uWSGI instance for Web2py
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=www-data
    Group=www-data
    WorkingDirectory=/var/www/web2py
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/uwsgi --ini /var/www/web2py/uwsgi.ini
    Restart=always
    KillSignal=SIGQUIT
    Type=notify
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    **Important:**

    - Replace `/var/www/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py directory.
    - The `User` and `Group` should match the user and group that Nginx runs under (usually `www-data`).

4.  **Enable and start the uWSGI service:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl enable web2py
    sudo systemctl start web2py
    sudo systemctl status web2py  # Check the status for errors
    ```

5.  **Configure Nginx:**

    Create a new Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/web2py`):

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com; # Replace with your domain

        access_log /var/log/nginx/web2py.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/web2py.error.log;

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

        location /static {
            root /var/www/web2py/welcome/; # Adjust for your default app
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location / {
            include uwsgi_params;
            uwsgi_pass unix:/var/www/web2py/web2py.sock;  # Match the socket from uwsgi.ini
            uwsgi_read_timeout 300; # Increase timeout for long requests
        }
    }
    ```

    **Important:**

    - Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
    - Update `/var/www/web2py` to your Web2py installation directory.
    - The `root` in the `location /static` block should point to the `static` folder of your default app.
    - The `uwsgi_pass` directive should match the `socket` defined in your `uwsgi.ini` file.

6.  **Enable the site and restart Nginx:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/web2py /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
    sudo nginx -t  # Test the Nginx configuration for errors
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

7.  **Consider using HTTPS (recommended). Use Certbot to configure Nginx:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
    ```

**uWSGI Advantages:**

- High performance.
- Flexible configuration.
- Supports various protocols (HTTP, uwsgi, etc.).

**uWSGI Disadvantages:**

- More complex configuration than WSGI.
- Can be challenging to troubleshoot.

### 3. Gunicorn

Gunicorn ('Green Unicorn') is a pre-fork WSGI server for UNIX. It's simpler to configure than uWSGI while still offering good performance.

**Steps for using Gunicorn with Nginx:**

1.  **Install Gunicorn and Nginx:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip nginx
    pip3 install gunicorn
    ```

2.  **Create a Gunicorn configuration file (e.g., `gunicorn.conf.py`) in your Web2py application directory (e.g., `/var/www/web2py`):**

    ```plaintext
    import os
    import sys

    # Add Web2py to the Python path
    web2py_path = '/var/www/web2py'  # Change this to your Web2py directory
    if web2py_path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(web2py_path)

    # Set the web2py environment variable (important!)
    os.environ['WEB2PY_PATH'] = web2py_path

    workers = 3  # Adjust based on your server's CPU cores
    worker_class = 'sync'  # Or 'gevent', 'eventlet' for asynchronous workers
    bind = 'unix:/var/www/web2py/web2py.sock'
    accesslog = '/var/log/gunicorn/access.log'
    errorlog = '/var/log/gunicorn/error.log'
    capture_output = True
    loglevel = 'info'
    ```

    **Important:**

    - Replace `/var/www/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py directory.
    - Adjust the `workers` based on your server's CPU cores.
    - The `bind` setting specifies the Unix socket.

3.  **Create a systemd service file (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/web2py.service`):**

    ```plaintext
    [Unit]
    Description=Gunicorn instance for Web2py
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=www-data
    Group=www-data
    WorkingDirectory=/var/www/web2py
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/gunicorn --config /var/www/web2py/gunicorn.conf.py web2py.wsgihandler:application
    Restart=always
    KillSignal=SIGQUIT
    Type=notify

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    **Important:**

    - Replace `/var/www/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py directory.
    - The `User` and `Group` should match the user and group that Nginx runs under (usually `www-data`).

4.  **Enable and start the Gunicorn service:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl enable web2py
    sudo systemctl start web2py
    sudo systemctl status web2py  # Check the status for errors
    ```

5.  **Configure Nginx:**

    Create a new Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/web2py`):

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com; # Replace with your domain

        access_log /var/log/nginx/web2py.access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/web2py.error.log;

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

        location /static {
            root /var/www/web2py/welcome/; # Adjust for your default app
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location / {
            include uwsgi_params; # Use uwsgi_params even with Gunicorn
            uwsgi_pass unix:/var/www/web2py/web2py.sock; # Match the socket from gunicorn.conf.py
            uwsgi_read_timeout 300;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Important:**

    - Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
    - Update `/var/www/web2py` to your Web2py installation directory.
    - The `root` in the `location /static` block should point to the `static` folder of your default app.
    - The `uwsgi_pass` directive should match the `bind` setting in your `gunicorn.conf.py` file. We use `uwsgi_params` here as they are commonly available and work well with Gunicorn using a Unix socket.

6.  **Enable the site and restart Nginx:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/web2py /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
    sudo nginx -t  # Test the Nginx configuration for errors
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

7.  **Consider using HTTPS (recommended). Use Certbot to configure Nginx:**

    ```plaintext
    sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
    ```

**Gunicorn Advantages:**

- Simple to configure.
- Good performance.
- Mature and well-documented.

**Gunicorn Disadvantages:**

- May not be as performant as uWSGI under extremely high load.
