# Troubleshooting WebSocket Disconnections: Adjusting `proxy_read_timeout` for Stability

WebSocket technology empowers real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and servers, making it ideal for applications like chat platforms, online gaming, and live data feeds. However, WebSocket connections can be susceptible to intermittent disconnections, leading to a frustrating user experience. One common culprit behind these frustrating disconnections is an improperly configured `proxy_read_timeout` setting within your reverse proxy or load balancer. This blog post will delve into the `proxy_read_timeout` parameter, explaining how it impacts WebSocket connections and how to adjust it for optimal stability, using practical examples for both Nginx and Apache.

## Understanding WebSocket Connections and the Role of Reverse Proxies

Before diving into the specifics of `proxy_read_timeout`, let's recap how WebSocket connections work in a typical production environment:

1.  **Client Initiation:** A client (e.g., a web browser) initiates a standard HTTP(S) connection to a server.
2.  **Upgrade Request:** The client sends an "Upgrade" request to the server, signaling its intention to establish a WebSocket connection. This request contains specific headers, most notably `Upgrade: websocket` and `Connection: Upgrade`.
3.  **Server Acceptance:** If the server supports WebSockets and accepts the request, it responds with a 101 Switching Protocols status code, confirming the upgrade to the WebSocket protocol.
4.  **Bi-Directional Communication:** The connection is now a persistent WebSocket connection, allowing for real-time, two-way communication between the client and the server.

In most production environments, a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) sits in front of the application server. The reverse proxy handles:

- **SSL/TLS Termination:** Offloading the resource-intensive task of encrypting and decrypting traffic.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple application server instances for scalability and high availability.
- **Caching:** Caching static content to improve performance.
- **Security:** Adding a layer of security by hiding the internal application server architecture.

When a client attempts to establish a WebSocket connection, the reverse proxy must correctly forward the initial HTTP(S) request and then maintain the persistent WebSocket connection after the upgrade.

## The `proxy_read_timeout` Parameter: The Connection Watchdog

The `proxy_read_timeout` parameter (or its equivalent in other reverse proxies) specifies the maximum time (usually in seconds) that the proxy server will wait for a response from the upstream server (your application server) after it has sent a request. In the context of WebSocket connections, this translates to: _how long will the proxy wait for activity on the WebSocket connection before assuming it's dead and closing it?_

The default value of `proxy_read_timeout` is often too short for WebSocket connections, especially for applications with periods of inactivity. For instance, a chat application might have users who are connected but not actively sending messages for minutes or even hours. If the `proxy_read_timeout` is set to a low value (e.g., 60 seconds), the proxy will terminate the connection after 60 seconds of inactivity, resulting in an unexpected disconnection on the client-side.

**Symptoms of an Incorrect `proxy_read_timeout`:**

- **Intermittent Disconnections:** Clients randomly disconnect from the WebSocket connection after a period of inactivity.
- **Connection Errors in Browser Console:** You might see errors in the browser console related to connection closure, such as "WebSocket connection to 'wss://...' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established." or "WebSocket connection closed with code 1006 (abnormal closure)".
- **Server Logs Indicating Connection Termination:** Reverse proxy logs showing that the connection was closed due to a timeout.

## Adjusting `proxy_read_timeout` to Fix WebSocket Disconnections

The solution to this problem is to increase the `proxy_read_timeout` value to a reasonable duration that accommodates periods of inactivity within your WebSocket application. The appropriate value will depend on your specific application's usage patterns. A good starting point is 300 seconds (5 minutes) or even longer if you expect extended periods of inactivity.

Here's how to adjust the `proxy_read_timeout` in popular reverse proxies:

### 1. Nginx Configuration

In Nginx, you need to configure the `proxy_read_timeout` directive within the `http`, `server`, or `location` block of your configuration file (usually located in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`). It's generally best to configure it within the `location` block that handles WebSocket traffic. You'll also want to configure `proxy_send_timeout` and other relevant settings.

```nginx
http {
    # ... other configurations ...

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://your_upstream_server;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

            # Increase timeouts for WebSocket connections
            proxy_read_timeout 300s;  # 5 minutes
            proxy_send_timeout 300s;  # 5 minutes
            send_timeout 300s;       # Client send timeout (affects overall connection)

        }

        # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Optional but recommended)
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name example.com;

        ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private_key.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://your_upstream_server;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

            # Increase timeouts for WebSocket connections
            proxy_read_timeout 300s;  # 5 minutes
            proxy_send_timeout 300s;  # 5 minutes
            send_timeout 300s;       # Client send timeout (affects overall connection)
        }
    }

}
```

**Explanation:**

- `proxy_pass http://your_upstream_server;`: Specifies the upstream server (your application server) that handles WebSocket traffic. Replace `http://your_upstream_server` with the actual address of your server.
- `proxy_http_version 1.1;`: Enables HTTP/1.1 for persistent connections, which is essential for WebSockets.
- `proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;`: Passes the "Upgrade" header from the client to the upstream server.
- `proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";`: Passes the "Connection" header to the upstream server. **Crucially, the value must be `"upgrade"` and not `$http_connection"` which can sometimes be seen in older examples.**
- `proxy_read_timeout 300s;`: Sets the read timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes). Adjust this value as needed.
- `proxy_send_timeout 300s;`: Sets the send timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes). This is the timeout for sending data to the upstream server. Important to set this alongside `proxy_read_timeout`.
- `send_timeout 300s;`: Sets the timeout for sending data to the client. This is also important for WebSocket stability.

**Important Considerations for Nginx:**

- **`location /` vs. More Specific Locations:** If your WebSocket application is served on a specific path (e.g., `/ws`), configure the `location` block accordingly: `location /ws { ... }`. This will only apply the WebSocket settings to that specific endpoint.
- **SSL Configuration:** Ensure that you have properly configured SSL certificates for secure WebSocket connections (`wss://`). The example above includes a basic HTTPS configuration. Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/certificate.pem` and `/path/to/your/private_key.pem` with the actual paths to your certificate and private key files.
- **After making changes, reload Nginx:** `sudo nginx -t` (to test configuration) followed by `sudo nginx -s reload` (to reload configuration).

### 2. Apache Configuration

In Apache, you can use `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_wstunnel` to handle WebSocket connections. The relevant timeout setting is `ProxyTimeout`. This directive defines the maximum time (in seconds) that Apache will wait to receive or send data on the proxy connection.

First, ensure that the necessary modules are enabled:

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
sudo a2enmod proxy_http  # Required for initial HTTP connection
sudo a2enmod headers     # required for setting HTTP headers
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Then, modify your Apache VirtualHost configuration file (usually located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`):

```plaintext
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    Redirect permanent / https://example.com/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/certificate.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your/private_key.pem

    # Enable Proxying and WebSocket support
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On

    <Location />
        ProxyPass  ws://your_upstream_server/  # or wss:// for secure WebSockets
        ProxyPassReverse ws://your_upstream_server/ # or wss://
        ProxyPass  http://your_upstream_server/  # regular http for initial connection.  Remove if only websockets are served
        ProxyPassReverse http://your_upstream_server/  # regular http for initial connection.  Remove if only websockets are served

        <IfModule mod_proxy_wstunnel.c>
           ProxyPass        /  ws://your_upstream_server/  upgrade=WebSocket  connection=Upgrade
           ProxyPassReverse /  ws://your_upstream_server/  upgrade=WebSocket connection=Upgrade
        </IfModule>

        # Set the ProxyTimeout
        ProxyTimeout 300

        # Required for WebSocket to work correctly (setting headers)
        RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Proto" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
        RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Port"  %{SERVER_PORT}

    </Location>

    # Other configurations...
</VirtualHost>
```

**Explanation:**

- `ProxyRequests Off`: Disables forward proxying, ensuring that Apache only acts as a reverse proxy.
- `ProxyPreserveHost On`: Passes the original Host header from the client to the upstream server.
- `ProxyPass  ws://your_upstream_server/`: Configures the proxy to forward requests to the upstream server for WebSocket connections (using `ws://` for unencrypted or `wss://` for encrypted). Replace `your_upstream_server` with the actual address of your server.
- `ProxyPassReverse ws://your_upstream_server/`: Configures the proxy to rewrite redirects from the upstream server.
- `<IfModule mod_proxy_wstunnel.c>`: This is important to ensure the configuration only runs if the `mod_proxy_wstunnel` module is available.
- `ProxyTimeout 300`: Sets the proxy timeout to 300 seconds (5 minutes). Adjust this value as needed.
- `RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Proto" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}`: Sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to indicate whether the original request was HTTP or HTTPS. This is essential if your application needs to know the original protocol.
- `RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Port"  %{SERVER_PORT}`: Sets the `X-Forwarded-Port` header so the application server knows the original port.

**Important Considerations for Apache:**

- **Module Enablement:** Make sure that `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_wstunnel`, `mod_proxy_http` and `mod_headers` are enabled. If they are not, Apache will not be able to handle WebSocket connections correctly.
- **VirtualHost Configuration:** The configuration should be placed within the appropriate `<VirtualHost>` block for your domain.
- **SSL Configuration:** As with Nginx, ensure you have correctly configured SSL for secure WebSocket connections (`wss://`).
- **Restart Apache:** After making changes, restart Apache: `sudo systemctl restart apache2`.

## Beyond `proxy_read_timeout`: Other Factors to Consider

While adjusting `proxy_read_timeout` is often the key to resolving WebSocket disconnections, other factors can also contribute:

- **Network Connectivity Issues:** Unstable network connections, packet loss, or firewalls can interrupt WebSocket connections. Check your network infrastructure for potential problems.
- **Server Overload:** If your server is under heavy load, it may be unable to maintain WebSocket connections reliably. Monitor your server's resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and consider scaling up your infrastructure if necessary.
- **Client-Side Issues:** Problems on the client-side (e.g., browser bugs, network issues) can also lead to disconnections. Test your WebSocket application across different browsers and network conditions.
- **Keep-Alive Mechanisms:** Consider implementing keep-alive mechanisms at the application level (sending periodic ping/pong messages) to prevent idle connections from being terminated by intermediaries. This can often be configured within your WebSocket library.
- **Load Balancer Configuration:** If you're using a load balancer, ensure that it's configured to properly handle WebSocket connections and persistent connections. Sticky sessions (ensuring that a client always connects to the same server) can be beneficial. Check the load balancer's timeout settings as well.
- **Websocket Library Configuration**: Some WebSocket libraries have their own timeout configurations that can conflict with proxy settings. Make sure these are aligned.

## Monitoring and Testing

After adjusting the `proxy_read_timeout` (or other settings), it's crucial to monitor your WebSocket application for stability. Use browser developer tools, server logs, and application-level monitoring to track connection status and identify any remaining issues. Simulate realistic usage scenarios, including periods of inactivity, to ensure that connections are maintained as expected.

## Conclusion

By understanding the role of `proxy_read_timeout` and carefully configuring your reverse proxy or load balancer, you can significantly improve the stability of your WebSocket connections and provide a better user experience for your real-time applications. Remember to monitor your application after making changes and consider other potential factors that can contribute to disconnections. A proactive approach to troubleshooting will ensure that your WebSocket-powered applications remain reliable and responsive.
