# How to Check Disk Space in CMD (Windows): wmic diskdrive get size, chkdsk

Keeping an eye on your disk space is crucial for maintaining the performance and stability of your Windows system. Running out of disk space can lead to slowdowns, application errors, and even prevent you from saving new files. While the graphical interface offers a straightforward way to check storage capacity, the Command Prompt (CMD) provides a powerful alternative, especially useful for automation or when you need more detailed information. This guide explores several methods for checking disk space in CMD, including using `wmic diskdrive get size` and `chkdsk`, offering practical examples and explanations to help you manage your storage effectively.

## Why Use CMD to Check Disk Space?

While graphical tools like File Explorer are convenient, CMD offers several advantages:

*   **Automation:** You can script CMD commands to automate disk space checks and integrate them into your monitoring systems.
*   **Remote Access:** CMD allows you to check disk space on remote computers via remote desktop or other command-line tools.
*   **Detailed Information:**  CMD commands can provide more detailed information than the GUI, such as specific disk sizes in bytes.
*   **Troubleshooting:**  CMD tools like `chkdsk` can identify and fix disk errors that might be affecting available space.
*   **Lightweight:**  CMD commands are often faster and consume fewer resources than opening large graphical applications.

## Method 1: Using `wmic diskdrive get size`

The Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) is a powerful tool for querying and managing Windows systems. It can be used to retrieve various information about your computer, including disk drive details. The `wmic diskdrive get size` command is a simple and effective way to get the size of your disk drives.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.  Alternatively, search for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu and run it.
2.  **Execute the command:** Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```cmd
    wmic diskdrive get size
    ```

    **Example Output:**

    ```
    Size
    250059350016
    ```

    This output displays the size of your disk in bytes.

3.  **Interpreting the Output:**  The output is in bytes, which can be difficult to interpret directly. To convert bytes to gigabytes (GB), you can use a calculator or a script. A quick approximation is to divide the output by 1,073,741,824 (1 GB in bytes).  In the example above, 250059350016 bytes is approximately 233 GB.

**Converting to GB directly in CMD (with PowerShell):**

Since CMD lacks built-in mathematical functions for large numbers, you can use a PowerShell command within CMD to perform the conversion:

```cmd
powershell -Command "(Get-WmiObject win32_logicaldisk -Filter 'DriveType=3' | ForEach-Object {$_.DeviceID + ':' + ($_.Size/1GB).ToString('F2') + ' GB'}) -join '`r`n'"
```

This command will output each drive letter and its size in GB, formatted to two decimal places.

**Explanation:**

*   `powershell -Command`:  Tells CMD to execute the following command in PowerShell.
*   `Get-WmiObject win32_logicaldisk -Filter 'DriveType=3'`:  Gets all logical disks (partitions) with a `DriveType` of 3, which typically represents local hard drives.
*   `ForEach-Object {$_.DeviceID + ':' + ($_.Size/1GB).ToString('F2') + ' GB'}`:  Iterates through each disk object, extracts the `DeviceID` (drive letter), divides the `Size` property by 1 GB (1024 * 1024 * 1024), formats the result to two decimal places using `ToString('F2')`, and concatenates the drive letter, size, and "GB" string.
*   `-join '`r`n'`:  Joins the output from each disk object with a carriage return and newline character, creating a multi-line output.

## Method 2: Using `chkdsk` (Check Disk)

The `chkdsk` command is primarily used to verify the file system integrity of a volume and fix logical file system errors. However, it also displays information about disk space usage, including total space, used space, and free space.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**  Search for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu, right-click on it, and select "Run as administrator."  `chkdsk` often requires administrative privileges to function correctly.
2.  **Execute the command:** Type `chkdsk` followed by the drive letter you want to check, and press Enter. For example, to check the C: drive, type:

    ```cmd
    chkdsk C:
    ```

    **Example Output:**

    ```
    The type of the file system is NTFS.

    Volume label is Windows.

    ```

3.  **Interpreting the Output:** The output of `chkdsk` provides a detailed breakdown of disk space usage:

    *   `total disk space`: The total capacity of the disk.
    *   `KB in files`: The space occupied by all files on the disk.
    *   `KB in indexes`: The space used by file system indexes.
    *   `KB in bad sectors`: The space marked as unusable due to errors.
    *   `KB in use by the system`:  The space used by the operating system, including the page file.
    *   `KB occupied by the log file`: The space used by the NTFS transaction log.
    *   `KB available on disk`: The free space on the disk.

    The output is typically in kilobytes (KB). To convert to GB, divide by 1,048,576 (1 GB in KB). For example, 249980416 KB is approximately 238.4 GB.

**Important Notes about `chkdsk`:**

*   **Read-Only Mode:**  By default, `chkdsk` runs in read-only mode, meaning it won't fix any errors.  To fix errors, you need to use the `/F` parameter (e.g., `chkdsk C: /F`).
*   **Exclusive Access:** When running `chkdsk /F` on the boot drive (usually C:), you'll be prompted to schedule the check to run on the next system restart because the drive needs exclusive access.
*   **Backups:**  It's *highly recommended* to back up your data before running `chkdsk /F`, especially on older or failing drives, as fixing errors can sometimes lead to data loss.

## Method 3: Using `fsutil volume diskfree`

The `fsutil` command is a powerful command-line utility that provides various file system-related functions. The `fsutil volume diskfree` command specifically retrieves disk space information for a specified volume.

**Steps:**

1. **Open Command Prompt:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. **Execute the command:** Type the following command, replacing `C:` with the drive letter you want to check, and press Enter:

   ```cmd
   fsutil volume diskfree C:
   ```

   **Example Output:**

   ```
   Total free bytes        : 79,135,418,368
   Total bytes             : 256,060,512,256
   ```

3. **Interpreting the Output:** The output shows the total free bytes and total bytes of the specified volume.

   *   **Total free bytes:** Represents the amount of free disk space available on the volume, expressed in bytes.
   *   **Total bytes:** Represents the total disk space capacity of the volume, expressed in bytes.

   Again, you'll need to convert bytes to GB.  For example:

   *   79,135,418,368 bytes / 1,073,741,824 bytes/GB = Approximately 73.7 GB free
   *   256,060,512,256 bytes / 1,073,741,824 bytes/GB = Approximately 238.5 GB total
