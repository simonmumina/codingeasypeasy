# SQL Server SESSIONPROPERTY(): Understanding and Utilizing Session Context in SQL Queries

The SQL Server `SESSIONPROPERTY()` function is a powerful tool that allows you to retrieve information about the current session. This information can be invaluable for a variety of purposes, including security auditing, performance optimization, and customizing user experiences. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve deep into `SESSIONPROPERTY()`, exploring its capabilities, syntax, and practical applications with real-world examples.

## What is the `SESSIONPROPERTY()` Function?

The `SESSIONPROPERTY()` function in SQL Server returns a property value related to the current session.  This essentially means information about the connection being made to the database, not about database objects or the data itself. This contextual information can be used to dynamically alter query behavior, log activities, or enforce specific policies based on the connection's characteristics.

## Syntax of `SESSIONPROPERTY()`

The syntax for the `SESSIONPROPERTY()` function is relatively straightforward:

```sql
SESSIONPROPERTY ( property )
```

Where `property` is a string expression that specifies the session property to retrieve. SQL Server supports a specific set of property names, which we will explore in detail.

## Available Session Properties

The `SESSIONPROPERTY()` function supports the following properties:

| Property Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Return Type |

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of using `SESSIONPROPERTY()`:

**1. Retrieving the Application Name:**

This is one of the most common uses of `SESSIONPROPERTY()`.  It allows you to identify which application is connecting to the database.

```sql
SELECT SESSIONPROPERTY('application_name') AS ApplicationName;
```

This query will return the name of the application that established the current connection.  You can set the application name within the connection string of your application.  For example, in a .NET application:

```csharp
string connectionString = "Data Source=YourServer;Initial Catalog=YourDatabase;Integrated Security=True;Application Name=MyWebApp";
```

**2. Checking ANSI Defaults:**

You can verify if ANSI defaults are enabled for the current session:

```sql
SELECT SESSIONPROPERTY('ansi_defaults') AS AnsiDefaults;
```

This will return `1` if ANSI defaults are enabled and `0` otherwise.  Understanding ANSI defaults is crucial for data consistency and avoiding unexpected behavior.

**3. Retrieving the Host Name:**

To identify the client workstation that initiated the connection:

```sql
SELECT SESSIONPROPERTY('host_name') AS HostName;
```

This is useful for auditing and tracking connection origins.

**4. Determining the Transaction Isolation Level:**

To get the current transaction isolation level:

```sql
SELECT SESSIONPROPERTY('isolation_level') AS IsolationLevel;
```

Understanding the isolation level is critical for managing concurrency and data consistency in multi-user environments.

**5. Monitoring Memory Usage:**

To check the amount of memory being used by the current session:

```sql
SELECT SESSIONPROPERTY('current_memory') AS CurrentMemoryKB;
```

This can be helpful for identifying sessions that are consuming excessive resources.  Keep in mind you'll need `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission to execute this successfully.

**6. Logging Connection Information:**

You can combine `SESSIONPROPERTY()` with other functions to log detailed connection information for auditing purposes.  For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE SessionLog (
    SessionID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ConnectTime DATETIME2,
    ApplicationName NVARCHAR(128),
    HostName NVARCHAR(128),
    LoginName SYSNAME,
    ClientNetAddress VARCHAR(48),
    ClientTcpPort INT,
    LogTime DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

INSERT INTO SessionLog (ConnectTime, ApplicationName, HostName, LoginName, ClientNetAddress, ClientTcpPort)
SELECT
    CAST(SESSIONPROPERTY('connect_time') AS DATETIME2),
    CAST(SESSIONPROPERTY('application_name') AS NVARCHAR(128)),
    CAST(SESSIONPROPERTY('host_name') AS NVARCHAR(128)),
    SYSTEM_USER,
    CAST(SESSIONPROPERTY('client_net_address') AS VARCHAR(48)),
    CAST(SESSIONPROPERTY('client_tcp_port') AS INT);

SELECT * FROM SessionLog;
```

This example creates a `SessionLog` table and inserts connection details whenever a new connection is established. Note that this will only log the *current* session's information upon execution of the INSERT statement; you'll need to implement a mechanism (e.g., a trigger) to automatically capture session details on connection. You'll also need `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission to access `client_net_address` and `client_tcp_port`.

**7. Conditional Logic Based on Application Name:**

You can use `SESSIONPROPERTY()` to conditionally execute different code blocks based on the application connecting to the database.  This is useful for tailoring behavior to specific applications.

```sql
IF SESSIONPROPERTY('application_name') = 'MyWebApp'
BEGIN
    -- Execute code specific to MyWebApp
    SELECT 'Executing code for MyWebApp';
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    -- Execute default code
    SELECT 'Executing default code';
END
```

## Important Considerations

* **Permissions:**  Some `SESSIONPROPERTY()` properties, particularly those related to network information and memory usage, require the `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission. Ensure that the user executing the query has the necessary permissions.

* **Data Types:**  The `SESSIONPROPERTY()` function returns a `sql_variant` data type.  You may need to explicitly cast the result to the appropriate data type for comparison or storage, as demonstrated in the logging example.

* **Deprecation:** Be aware of deprecated properties like `program_name` and `transaction_isolation_level`, and use the recommended alternatives (`application_name` and `isolation_level`, respectively).  Deprecated features may be removed in future versions of SQL Server.

* **Performance:**  While `SESSIONPROPERTY()` is generally lightweight, excessive use within frequently executed code can potentially impact performance. Use it judiciously, especially in high-volume environments.

* **Security:** Avoid using `SESSIONPROPERTY()` for critical security decisions without proper validation and sanitization of the retrieved values.  User-supplied application names or hostnames could be spoofed.

* **NULL Returns:**  Certain properties might return `NULL` under specific circumstances, such as when the information is unavailable or the required permissions are missing.  Always handle potential `NULL` values appropriately in your code.

## Conclusion

The `SESSIONPROPERTY()` function is a valuable tool for understanding and utilizing session context within SQL Server.  By leveraging its capabilities, you can enhance security auditing, optimize performance, customize user experiences, and implement dynamic query behavior based on connection characteristics.  By understanding the available properties, potential limitations, and best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively incorporate `SESSIONPROPERTY()` into your SQL Server solutions.
