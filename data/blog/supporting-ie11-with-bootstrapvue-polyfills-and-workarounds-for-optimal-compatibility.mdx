# Supporting IE11 with BootstrapVue: Polyfills and Workarounds for Optimal Compatibility

Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), while a relic of the past, is still relevant for some users. If you're building web applications with BootstrapVue and need to support IE11, you'll quickly realize that it requires some extra effort. IE11 lacks many modern JavaScript features and CSS standards, making it incompatible with modern web development techniques used by BootstrapVue and Vue.js in general. This article provides a comprehensive guide to supporting IE11 using polyfills, workarounds, and configuration tweaks, ensuring your BootstrapVue application functions as intended.

## Why Bother Supporting IE11?

Before diving into the technical details, it's worth considering _why_ you need to support IE11. While its market share is negligible in many regions, certain industries and organizations might still rely on it. Understanding your target audience will help you decide if the effort of supporting IE11 is justified.

## The Core Problem: Modern JavaScript Features

The primary reason IE11 struggles with modern web apps is its lack of support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later features. BootstrapVue and Vue.js heavily rely on these features, including:

- **Arrow Functions:** `() => {}`
- **Classes:** `class MyClass {}`
- **`const` and `let`:** Variable declarations
- **Template Literals:** `` `String with ${variable}` ``
- **Promises:** Asynchronous operations
- **`Array.from`:** Converting array-like objects to arrays
- **`Object.assign`:** Copying properties from one object to another

These features, among others, are not natively supported in IE11.

## The Solution: Polyfills

Polyfills are code snippets that provide modern functionality in older browsers. They "fill in" the gaps by implementing the missing features using techniques compatible with the target browser.

### 1. Core-js: Essential Polyfills

`core-js` is a widely used JavaScript library that provides polyfills for many ES6+ features. It's highly recommended for supporting IE11.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install core-js --save
```

**Integration:**

You'll need to import `core-js` at the beginning of your main JavaScript file (e.g., `main.js` or `app.js`). Import specific modules you need. This approach keeps bundle size down as you only import the polyfills you actually need.

```javascript
// main.js or app.js
import 'core-js/stable' // Imports all stable ES features
// Alternatively, import only specific features for smaller bundle size:
// import 'core-js/features/promise';
// import 'core-js/features/array/from';
// import 'core-js/features/object/assign';

import Vue from 'vue'
import BootstrapVue from 'bootstrap-vue'
import App from './App.vue'

Vue.use(BootstrapVue)

new Vue({
  render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount('#app')
```

**Important:** The `@babel/preset-env` configuration (explained in the next section) handles _which_ polyfills from `core-js` are actually included in your build, based on your browser targets.

### 2. Babel: Transpilation and Targeted Polyfills

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript code into older, more compatible versions. Combined with the `@babel/preset-env` plugin, it can automatically determine which polyfills are needed based on your target browser(s), including IE11.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env babel-loader
```

**Configuration:**

Create a `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory. This file configures Babel's behavior.

**`.babelrc` example:**

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "ie": "11" // Target IE11
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "usage", // Only include polyfills that are actually used
        "corejs": { "version": 3, "proposals": true } // Specify core-js version and enable proposals
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

**`babel.config.js` example:**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@babel/preset-env',
      {
        targets: {
          ie: '11',
        },
        useBuiltIns: 'usage',
        corejs: { version: 3, proposals: true },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `@babel/preset-env`: Automatically determines the necessary transformations and polyfills based on the `targets` configuration.
- `targets`: Specifies the target browsers. Setting `"ie": "11"` tells Babel to target IE11.
- `useBuiltIns`: Controls how Babel handles polyfills. `"usage"` is recommended because it only includes polyfills that are actually used in your code, reducing the final bundle size. Other options include `"entry"` which requires changes to your entry point.
- `corejs`: Specifies the version of `core-js` being used (usually the latest version). `proposals: true` enables support for ECMAScript proposals, which might be needed for some libraries. Ensure the version number matches the version of `core-js` you installed.

**Webpack Integration (vue-cli project):**

If you're using `vue-cli`, Babel is already integrated into your build process. You simply need to create or modify your `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` file.

If you're using Webpack without `vue-cli`, you'll need to configure `babel-loader` in your `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
      // ... other rules
    ],
  },
  // ... other configurations
}
```

This rule tells Webpack to use `babel-loader` to process all `.js` files (except those in `node_modules`) according to the Babel configuration in your `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` file.

### 3. Element.prototype.closest Polyfill

IE11 lacks native support for `Element.prototype.closest()`, a method used by BootstrapVue (and many other libraries) to traverse the DOM tree. You'll need to include a polyfill for this method.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install element-closest --save
```

**Integration:**

Import the polyfill in your `main.js` or `app.js` file:

```javascript
// main.js or app.js
import 'element-closest'
```

Alternatively, you can directly include the polyfill in your HTML file using a CDN or a local file:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My BootstrapVue App</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/element-closest@1.0.2/element-closest.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 4. URL Polyfill (Potentially Required)

Depending on your application's use of URLs, you might need a `URL` polyfill. IE11's `URL` object support is incomplete. Check for console errors related to `URL` if you encounter issues.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install whatwg-url --save
```

**Integration:**

```javascript
// main.js or app.js
import { URL, URLSearchParams } from 'whatwg-url'

// Polyfill for URL and URLSearchParams if not supported natively
if (!global.URL) {
  global.URL = URL
}

if (!global.URLSearchParams) {
  global.URLSearchParams = URLSearchParams
}
```

### 5. ResizeObserver Polyfill

If you are using components that dynamically adjust based on size changes, you might need `resize-observer-polyfill`. IE11 does not support `ResizeObserver`.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install resize-observer-polyfill --save
```

**Integration:**

```javascript
// main.js or app.js
import ResizeObserver from 'resize-observer-polyfill'

// Assign to window to make it globally available.
if (!window.ResizeObserver) {
  window.ResizeObserver = ResizeObserver
}
```

## CSS Considerations and Workarounds

While polyfills primarily address JavaScript compatibility, you also need to consider CSS issues.

### 1. Autoprefixer

Autoprefixer automatically adds vendor prefixes to your CSS rules, ensuring compatibility with different browsers, including IE11. This is usually handled by your build system (e.g., `vue-cli` with its built-in PostCSS support). Make sure it's configured to include prefixes for IE11.

**Configuration (PostCSS - vue.config.js):**

```javascript
// vue.config.js
module.exports = {
  css: {
    loaderOptions: {
      postcss: {
        plugins: [
          require('autoprefixer')({
            overrideBrowserslist: ['last 2 versions', 'ie >= 11'], // Target IE11
          }),
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### 2. Flexbox Issues

IE11 has some known issues with Flexbox layout. Consider using alternative layout techniques or applying specific Flexbox workarounds if you encounter problems. Common workarounds involve setting explicit heights or widths on Flexbox containers or items. BootstrapVue's grid system (based on Flexbox) can be tricky in IE11.

### 3. Grid Layout (Potentially Problematic)

While CSS Grid Layout is a powerful layout tool, IE11's implementation is outdated and buggy. It's generally recommended to avoid using CSS Grid for critical layout components if you need to support IE11. Instead, stick to Flexbox or older layout techniques.

## Testing and Debugging in IE11

Testing your application in IE11 is crucial to identify and resolve compatibility issues.

### 1. Virtual Machines

The most reliable way to test in IE11 is to use a virtual machine (VM) running Windows 7 or Windows 10 with IE11 installed. Microsoft provides pre-built VMs for testing: [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/)

### 2. BrowserStack and Sauce Labs

BrowserStack and Sauce Labs are cloud-based testing platforms that provide access to a wide range of browsers and devices, including IE11. These services offer a convenient way to test your application without setting up local VMs.

### 3. Developer Tools

IE11's developer tools are less advanced than those in modern browsers, but they're still useful for debugging. Pay attention to console errors, JavaScript exceptions, and CSS rendering issues. Use the "Emulation" tab in the developer tools to simulate different browser versions and screen sizes.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Blank Page or JavaScript Errors:** This usually indicates missing polyfills or JavaScript syntax errors. Check your Babel configuration and ensure that all necessary polyfills are included. Examine the console for error messages.
- **CSS Layout Problems:** IE11's CSS engine is less robust than modern browsers. Use Autoprefixer to ensure vendor prefixes are applied. Carefully review your CSS and look for potential Flexbox or Grid Layout issues.
- **Component Rendering Issues:** Some BootstrapVue components might not render correctly in IE11 due to CSS or JavaScript compatibility problems. Try simplifying the component's markup or using alternative components that are more IE11-friendly.
- **Slow Performance:** IE11 is generally slower than modern browsers. Optimize your code and reduce the number of DOM manipulations to improve performance. Avoid using complex animations or transitions.
- **Form Validation Issues:** IE11's form validation support is limited. Use a JavaScript-based form validation library to ensure consistent validation across all browsers.

## Example: A Simple BootstrapVue Component with IE11 Support

Here's a simple example of a BootstrapVue component that is designed to be compatible with IE11:

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, BootstrapVue!</h1>
    <b-button variant="primary">Click Me</b-button>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  mounted() {
    // Example of using a modern JavaScript feature (Promise)
    new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('Data loaded!');
        console.log("IE11 supported promise");
      }, 1000);
    }).then((data) => {
      console.log(data);
    });
  },
};
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Add any component-specific CSS here */
</style>
```

To ensure this component works correctly in IE11, you'll need to:

1.  Install and configure `core-js` and Babel as described above. The `Promise` polyfill will be automatically included by Babel based on your IE11 target.
2.  Run your build process (e.g., `npm run build`) to transpile the code and include the necessary polyfills.
3.  Test the component in IE11 to verify that it renders correctly and that the JavaScript code executes without errors.

## Conclusion

Supporting IE11 with BootstrapVue requires careful planning and the use of polyfills, transpilation, and CSS workarounds. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can significantly improve the compatibility of your application and ensure a smoother user experience for IE11 users. Remember to thoroughly test your application in IE11 to identify and resolve any remaining issues. However, constantly monitor IE11 usage. As its market share continues to decline, you might eventually be able to drop support for it, simplifying your development process and allowing you to embrace more modern web technologies fully.
