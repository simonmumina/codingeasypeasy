# SQL Server FLOOR() Function: Round Down Numbers with Examples

The SQL Server `FLOOR()` function is a powerful tool for rounding decimal numbers down to the nearest integer. This can be incredibly useful in a variety of scenarios, from financial calculations to data analysis and reporting. This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to using the `FLOOR()` function in SQL Server, complete with examples and practical use cases.

## What is the SQL Server FLOOR() Function?

The `FLOOR()` function is a built-in numeric function in SQL Server that returns the largest integer value that is less than or equal to a given number. In simpler terms, it rounds a number *down* to the nearest whole number.  Think of it as the "bottom" of the number line, rounding down toward negative infinity.

**Syntax:**

```sql
FLOOR ( numeric_expression )
```

*   **numeric_expression:**  This is the number or expression that you want to round down.  It can be a `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`, `FLOAT`, `REAL`, or `INT` data type.

**Return Value:**

The `FLOOR()` function returns the same data type as the input `numeric_expression`.

## Practical Examples of Using the FLOOR() Function

Let's dive into some practical examples to illustrate how the `FLOOR()` function works.

**Example 1: Basic Rounding**

```sql
SELECT FLOOR(3.14);  -- Output: 3
SELECT FLOOR(7.99);  -- Output: 7
SELECT FLOOR(-2.3);  -- Output: -3
SELECT FLOOR(5);     -- Output: 5 (no change as it's already an integer)
```

As you can see, `FLOOR()` consistently rounds down, even for negative numbers. For the value -2.3, the largest integer less than or equal to it is -3.

**Example 2: Using FLOOR() with Table Data**

Let's assume we have a table called `Products` with a column named `Price` that stores the price of each product.

```sql
-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(255),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) -- Price with 2 decimal places
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 1299.99),
(2, 'Mouse', 12.50),
(3, 'Keyboard', 75.75),
(4, 'Monitor', 249.00),
(5, 'USB Drive', 9.99);

-- Query to round down the price of each product
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Price, FLOOR(Price) AS RoundedPrice
FROM Products;
```

**Output:**

| ProductID | ProductName | Price    | RoundedPrice |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1         | Laptop      | 1299.99  | 1299         |
| 2         | Mouse       | 12.50    | 12           |
| 3         | Keyboard    | 75.75    | 75           |
| 4         | Monitor     | 249.00   | 249          |
| 5         | USB Drive   | 9.99     | 9            |

This example demonstrates how `FLOOR()` can be used to truncate the decimal part of the price, providing a simplified integer representation.  This could be useful for reporting purposes where you only want to see the whole dollar amount.

**Example 3: Using FLOOR() with Calculations**

The `FLOOR()` function can also be used in conjunction with other calculations. For example, let's say you need to calculate the number of full weeks that have passed since a particular date.

```sql
DECLARE @StartDate DATETIME = '2024-01-01';
DECLARE @EndDate DATETIME = GETDATE();  -- Current date and time

-- Calculate the number of days between the two dates
DECLARE @DaysDifference INT = DATEDIFF(day, @StartDate, @EndDate);

-- Calculate the number of full weeks that have passed
SELECT FLOOR(@DaysDifference / 7.0) AS NumberOfFullWeeks;
```

In this example, we divide the number of days by 7.0 (using 7.0 instead of 7 ensures that the result is a decimal).  Then, we use `FLOOR()` to round down the result to the nearest whole number, giving us the number of full weeks.

**Example 4:  Using FLOOR() for Pagination**

Imagine you're building a website with pagination and need to calculate the total number of pages required based on the number of results and the results per page.

```sql
DECLARE @TotalResults INT = 125;
DECLARE @ResultsPerPage INT = 10;

-- Calculate the total number of pages needed
SELECT CEILING(CAST(@TotalResults AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / @ResultsPerPage) AS TotalPages;
SELECT FLOOR((@TotalResults + @ResultsPerPage -1) / @ResultsPerPage ) AS TotalPagesFloor;


```

In this example, we are calculating the number of pages needed to display all results.  The crucial part here is ensuring that the result of the division is a decimal to allow proper rounding. `CEILING` rounds *up* to the nearest integer; we use it to ensure that even if there's a partial page of results, we still allocate a full page for them.  The `FLOOR` approach calculates the number of full groups of `ResultsPerPage` that fit into `TotalResults`, and then assumes any remainder requires an additional page. `CEILING` provides a more direct and generally preferred solution for pagination scenarios.

**Example 5: Applying FLOOR() with Aggregate Functions**

You can combine `FLOOR()` with aggregate functions like `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.

```sql
-- Assume we have a Sales table with a 'SaleAmount' column
-- Calculate the average sale amount, rounded down to the nearest dollar

SELECT FLOOR(AVG(SaleAmount)) AS AverageSaleAmountRounded
FROM Sales;
```

This query calculates the average of all `SaleAmount` values in the `Sales` table and then rounds the result down to the nearest integer using `FLOOR()`.

## Common Use Cases for the FLOOR() Function

Here are some common use cases for the `FLOOR()` function:

*   **Financial Calculations:**  Rounding down amounts for tax calculations, interest calculations, or commission calculations.  Be careful when using `FLOOR` in financial calculations as it always rounds *down*, potentially impacting revenue.  Consider the context carefully.
*   **Reporting:** Displaying data in a simplified format by removing decimal places.
*   **Data Analysis:** Grouping data into categories based on rounded values. For example, grouping customers based on their age rounded down to the nearest decade.
*   **Inventory Management:**  Calculating the number of full units that can be made from raw materials, ignoring any fractional amounts.
*   **Game Development:** Calculating grid positions or movement distances, ensuring they align with integer-based tile systems.

## FLOOR() vs. CEILING() vs. ROUND()

It's important to understand the difference between `FLOOR()`, `CEILING()`, and `ROUND()`:

*   **FLOOR():** Rounds *down* to the nearest integer.
*   **CEILING():** Rounds *up* to the nearest integer.
*   **ROUND():** Rounds to the nearest integer based on the decimal value.  If the decimal is .5 or greater, it rounds up; otherwise, it rounds down. The `ROUND()` function also accepts an optional length parameter to specify the number of decimal places to round to.

Here's a table summarizing the differences:

| Value    | FLOOR() | CEILING() | ROUND() |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 3.14     | 3       | 4         | 3       |
| 3.5      | 3       | 4         | 4       |
| 3.99     | 3       | 4         | 4       |
| -2.3     | -3      | -2        | -2      |
| -2.7     | -3      | -2        | -3      |

Choosing the correct function depends on the specific rounding behavior you need.

## Important Considerations

*   **Data Types:** Be aware of the data types you're working with.  `FLOOR()` works with numeric data types. Ensure your data is in a suitable format before applying the function.
*   **Null Values:** If the input `numeric_expression` is `NULL`, the `FLOOR()` function will return `NULL`.
*   **Performance:** For very large datasets, consider the performance implications of using `FLOOR()`, especially within complex queries.  Ensure you have appropriate indexes to optimize query execution.
*   **Business Logic:** Always carefully consider the business logic of your application when deciding whether to round up or down.  Incorrect rounding can have significant financial or operational consequences.

## Conclusion

The SQL Server `FLOOR()` function is a valuable tool for rounding numbers down to the nearest integer. By understanding its syntax, behavior, and common use cases, you can effectively leverage it to manipulate and analyze data in your SQL Server databases. Remember to consider the specific requirements of your application and choose the rounding function that best suits your needs.  By combining `FLOOR()` with other T-SQL functions, you can create powerful and flexible data processing solutions.
