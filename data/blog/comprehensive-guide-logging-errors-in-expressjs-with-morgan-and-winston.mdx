# Comprehensive Guide: Logging Errors in Express.js with Morgan and Winston

Effective error logging is crucial for building robust and maintainable Express.js applications. It allows you to quickly identify and fix issues, monitor application performance, and gain valuable insights into user behavior. This guide will explore how to implement robust error logging using two popular Node.js libraries: **Morgan** and **Winston**. We'll cover everything from basic setup to advanced configuration, providing practical code examples along the way.

## Why is Error Logging Important?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand why error logging is so critical:

*   **Debugging:**  Logs provide a trail of events leading up to an error, making it easier to pinpoint the root cause.
*   **Monitoring:**  Analyzing log data allows you to track application health, identify performance bottlenecks, and detect security threats.
*   **Auditing:** Logs can be used to track user activity and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Detailed logs allow you to understand which routes are slow or generate errors, allowing for targeted performance improvements.
*   **Proactive Issue Detection:** By monitoring logs, you can often identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

## Part 1: Request Logging with Morgan

**Morgan** is a widely used HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It simplifies the process of logging incoming requests to your Express.js application. It's designed for simplicity and customization, allowing you to track vital information about each request.

### Installation

First, install Morgan using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install morgan
# or
yarn add morgan
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Apply Morgan middleware
app.use(morgan('dev')); // 'dev' is a pre-defined format

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example, we're using the `'dev'` format, which provides concise, colored output to the console during development. When you make a request to the root endpoint (`/`), you'll see log entries in your console similar to this:

```
GET / 200 14.433 ms - 12
```

This output includes:

*   **Method:**  The HTTP method used for the request (e.g., GET, POST).
*   **Path:**  The requested URL path.
*   **Status Code:**  The HTTP status code returned by the server (e.g., 200 OK).
*   **Response Time:**  The time it took to process the request (in milliseconds).
*   **Content Length:** The size of the response body in bytes.

### Customizing Morgan

Morgan offers various pre-defined formats, including:

*   `'combined'`: Standard Apache combined log output.
*   `'common'`: Standard Apache common log output.
*   `'short'`: Shorter, more concise output.
*   `'tiny'`: Minimal output.

You can also create custom formats to log specific information. For example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a custom Morgan format
morgan.token('user-agent', function (req, res) {
  return req.headers['user-agent'];
});

const myFormat = ':method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms :user-agent';

app.use(morgan(myFormat));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This code defines a custom format that includes the user agent string. The `:user-agent` token is a custom token defined using `morgan.token()`.  Now, the log output will include the user agent making the request.

### Logging to a File

While console logging is useful during development, it's essential to log to a file in production environments.  You can achieve this using Node.js's built-in `fs` module or more conveniently, with a library like `rotating-file-stream`.  However, for production grade logging, using Winston (covered later) is generally recommended.

Here's a simple example using `fs`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const path = require('path');

// Create a write stream (use 'a' for appending instead of 'w' for overwriting)
const accessLogStream = fs.createWriteStream(
  path.join(__dirname, 'access.log'),
  { flags: 'a' }
);

// Setup the logger
app.use(morgan('combined', { stream: accessLogStream }));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This example creates a write stream to `access.log` and uses it as the stream for Morgan's logging output. All request logs will now be written to this file.

## Part 2: Advanced Error Logging with Winston

**Winston** is a powerful and flexible logging library for Node.js. It supports multiple transports (e.g., console, file, database), log levels, and custom formatting.  It's designed for more complex logging scenarios where you need granular control over log messages.

### Installation

Install Winston using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install winston
# or
yarn add winston
```

### Basic Winston Configuration

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info', // Minimum level to log
  format: winston.format.json(), // Log format (JSON is common)
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(), // Log to the console
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }), // Log errors to a file
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }) // Log all levels to a file
  ]
});

// Log messages
logger.info('This is an informational message');
logger.warn('This is a warning message');
logger.error('This is an error message');

// Example of logging an object
logger.info('User login attempt', { username: 'testuser', ip: '127.0.0.1' });

```

This code creates a Winston logger with the following configuration:

*   `level`: Sets the minimum log level to `info`. This means that messages with levels `info`, `warn`, `error`, etc., will be logged, but messages with level `debug` or `verbose` will be ignored.
*   `format`: Sets the log format to JSON. This makes it easier to parse and analyze log data.
*   `transports`:  Specifies where the logs should be written. In this case, logs are written to the console and to two separate files: `error.log` (for error-level messages) and `combined.log` (for all messages).

### Integrating Winston with Express.js

To integrate Winston with your Express.js application, you can create custom middleware to log requests and errors.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const winston = require('winston');
const expressWinston = require('express-winston');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Configure Winston logger
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' })
  ]
});

// Express Winston middleware for request logging
app.use(expressWinston.logger({
  winstonInstance: logger,
  meta: true,  // optional: log meta data about request (defaults to true)
  msg: "HTTP {{req.method}} {{req.url}}", // optional: customize the log message. E.g. "{{res.statusCode}} {{req.method}} {{res.url}} {{res.responseTime}}ms",
  expressFormat: true, // Use the default Express/morgan request formatting. Enabling this will override any msg if true. Will only output request related data.
  colorize: true,
}));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

// Simulate an error
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  next(new Error('This is a simulated error'));
});

// Express Winston error logging middleware
app.use(expressWinston.errorLogger({
  winstonInstance: logger,
}));

// Error handling middleware (must be defined last)
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack); // Log the error stack trace to the console (optional)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Key points in this example:

1.  **`expressWinston.logger`:** This middleware logs all incoming requests using the configured Winston logger. The `meta: true` option includes request metadata in the log entries.
2.  **`expressWinston.errorLogger`:**  This middleware catches unhandled exceptions and logs them using Winston. It must be placed *before* your custom error handling middleware.
3.  **Error Handling Middleware:**  The standard Express.js error handling middleware is still required to catch errors and send appropriate responses.  Make sure this is the *last* middleware defined in your application.

With this setup, request logs will appear in the console and `combined.log`, while error logs will appear in the console, `error.log`, and `combined.log`.

### Customizing Winston Format

Winston offers a powerful formatting system that allows you to customize the appearance of your log messages. You can use pre-defined formats or create your own.  Here's how to create a custom format with timestamps and colors:

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logFormat = winston.format.printf(({ timestamp, level, message }) => {
  return `${timestamp} ${level}: ${message}`;
});

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.colorize(),
    logFormat
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' })
  ]
});

logger.info('This is an informational message');
```

This code defines a custom format called `logFormat` that includes the timestamp, log level, and message. The `winston.format.combine` function combines multiple formats into a single format. `winston.format.timestamp()` adds a timestamp to the log entry, and `winston.format.colorize()` adds colors to the log level.

### Winston Transports

Winston supports a variety of transports, allowing you to send logs to different destinations. Some popular transports include:

*   **Console:** Logs to the console (the default).
*   **File:** Logs to a file.
*   **HTTP:** Sends logs to an HTTP endpoint.
*   **MongoDB:** Logs to a MongoDB database.
*   **Redis:** Logs to a Redis database.
*   **AWS CloudWatch:** Logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs.
*   **Graylog:** Logs to a Graylog server.

You can install additional transports using npm or yarn. For example, to install the MongoDB transport:

```bash
npm install winston-mongodb
# or
yarn add winston-mongodb
```

Then, you can add the MongoDB transport to your Winston logger:

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');
require('winston-mongodb'); // Import the Winston MongoDB transport

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.MongoDB({
      db: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/logs', // Replace with your MongoDB connection string
      collection: 'app_logs',
      options: { useUnifiedTopology: true } // Recommended option
    })
  ]
});

logger.info('This message will be logged to MongoDB');
```

Make sure to configure the transport with the appropriate options for your environment (e.g., MongoDB connection string).

###  Handling Uncaught Exceptions and Unhandled Rejections

In addition to logging regular errors, it's also important to handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections. Uncaught exceptions are errors that occur outside of try/catch blocks, while unhandled rejections are promises that are rejected but not caught. Winston can be configured to automatically catch these types of errors.

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' })
  ],
  exceptionHandlers: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'exceptions.log' }) // Log exceptions to a separate file
  ],
  rejectionHandlers: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'rejections.log' }) // Log rejections to a separate file
  ]
});

// Catch uncaught exceptions
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  logger.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
  // Optionally, exit the process after logging the exception
  // process.exit(1);  // Use with caution.  May be better to allow a monitoring system to restart the app.
});

// Catch unhandled rejections
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  logger.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
  // No need to exit the process here, as unhandled rejections are usually less critical than uncaught exceptions.
});

// Simulate an uncaught exception
// throw new Error('This is an uncaught exception');

// Simulate an unhandled rejection
// Promise.reject(new Error('This is an unhandled rejection'));

logger.info('Application started successfully.');
```

Important Considerations:

*   **Exception Handling and Process Exit:**  For uncaught exceptions, consider whether to exit the process after logging the error (`process.exit(1)`). Exiting the process can prevent the application from entering an unstable state, but it also means the application will be unavailable until it's restarted.  A monitoring system should be used to automatically restart the application.
*   **Unhandled Rejections are Often Less Critical:**  Unhandled rejections are generally less critical than uncaught exceptions, so it may not be necessary to exit the process.
*   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure they are working correctly.  Use tools like Jest or Mocha to write unit tests that simulate different error scenarios.

## Best Practices for Error Logging

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when implementing error logging in your Express.js applications:

*   **Choose the Right Logging Level:** Use appropriate log levels (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) to categorize log messages.
*   **Include Contextual Information:**  Include relevant information in your log messages, such as user IDs, request parameters, and timestamps.
*   **Use Structured Logging:**  Use a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) to make it easier to parse and analyze log data.  This makes querying your logs much easier.
*   **Centralize Your Logs:**  Send your logs to a central logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, Graylog) for easier analysis and monitoring.
*   **Rotate Your Log Files:**  Rotate your log files regularly to prevent them from growing too large. Winston and other logging libraries offer built-in log rotation features. Libraries such as `rotating-file-stream` are often used with Morgan for rotating logs.
*   **Secure Your Logs:**  Protect your logs from unauthorized access. Consider encrypting sensitive information in your logs.
*   **Monitor Your Logs:**  Regularly monitor your logs to identify and resolve issues proactively. Set up alerts to notify you of critical errors.
*   **Don't Log Sensitive Data:** Avoid logging sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or personal information in your logs.
