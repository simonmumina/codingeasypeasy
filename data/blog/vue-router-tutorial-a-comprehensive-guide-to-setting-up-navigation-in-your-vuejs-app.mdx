# Vue Router Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up Navigation in Your Vue.js App

Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js. It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications (SPAs) with client-side navigation a breeze. This guide will walk you through the entire process of setting up and using Vue Router in your Vue.js project.

## What is Vue Router and Why Use It?

In a traditional multi-page web application, each link click reloads the entire page.  SPAs, on the other hand, update the component displayed on the screen dynamically without reloading the page. This provides a smoother and more responsive user experience. Vue Router enables this behavior in Vue.js applications.

**Benefits of using Vue Router:**

*   **SPA Navigation:**  Create a fluid and seamless user experience by navigating between different "pages" (components) without full page reloads.
*   **Maintain Application State:**  Preserve application state during navigation, preventing data loss.
*   **Browser History Integration:**  Leverage the browser's history API to allow users to navigate with the back and forward buttons.
*   **Modular Structure:**  Organize your application into logical routes, improving code maintainability and readability.
*   **Dynamic Routing:**  Handle routes with dynamic segments for creating flexible and data-driven applications.
*   **SEO Friendliness:**  While traditionally SPAs can be challenging for SEO, techniques like server-side rendering (SSR) and pre-rendering can be combined with Vue Router to create SEO-friendly SPAs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Vue.js requires Node.js to be installed on your system, which comes with npm (Node Package Manager).  Yarn is an alternative package manager that works similarly to npm.
*   **Vue CLI (Optional but Recommended):** Vue CLI is a command-line interface for scaffolding Vue.js projects quickly. It simplifies project setup and provides a consistent development environment. Install it globally using: `npm install -g @vue/cli` or `yarn global add @vue/cli`.
*   **Basic Vue.js Knowledge:** Familiarity with Vue.js components, templates, and data binding is essential.

## Step 1: Creating a New Vue.js Project (If you don't have one already)

If you're starting from scratch, use Vue CLI to create a new project:

```bash
vue create vue-router-example
```

During the project creation process, you'll be prompted to select a preset.  Choose the "Manually select features" option and make sure to include the "Router" feature.

If you are adding `vue-router` to an existing Vue.js project, you can skip this step.

## Step 2: Installing Vue Router

If you didn't include Vue Router during the project creation process with Vue CLI, you can install it manually using npm or yarn:

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install vue-router@4
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add vue-router@4
```

**Why `@4`?**  Vue Router v4 is compatible with Vue.js 3.  If you're using Vue.js 2, you should install Vue Router v3 (`npm install vue-router@3`).  This guide focuses on Vue Router v4 with Vue 3.

## Step 3: Setting Up the Router

1.  **Create a `router` directory:** In your `src` directory, create a new folder named `router`.

2.  **Create `index.js`:**  Inside the `router` directory, create a file named `index.js`. This file will contain your router configuration.

3.  **Configure the Router:**  Add the following code to `src/router/index.js`:

```javascript
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue';
import AboutView from '../views/AboutView.vue';

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeView
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: AboutView
  }
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
  routes
});

export default router;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`createRouter`:**  This function creates a new router instance.
*   **`createWebHistory`:**  This function creates a browser history instance. It uses the HTML5 History API, allowing you to navigate without full page reloads and provides a clean URL structure.  The `process.env.BASE_URL` is automatically configured by Vue CLI.
*   **`routes`:** This array defines the routes for your application. Each route is an object with the following properties:
    *   **`path`:**  The URL path for the route.
    *   **`name`:**  (Optional) A name for the route.  This is useful for programmatic navigation (explained later).
    *   **`component`:**  The Vue component to render when the route is matched.  You'll need to import the components.

## Step 4: Creating Views

In the previous step, we referenced `HomeView` and `AboutView`.  Let's create these components.  If you used the Vue CLI with the Router feature, it might have created `views` directory already. If not, create `src/views` directory.

1.  **Create `HomeView.vue` in `src/views`:**

```vue
<!-- src/views/HomeView.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="home">
    <h1>Welcome to the Home Page!</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'HomeView'
}
</script>
```

2.  **Create `AboutView.vue` in `src/views`:**

```vue
<!-- src/views/AboutView.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="about">
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>This is the about page.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'AboutView'
}
</script>
```

## Step 5: Integrating the Router into Your App

Now, you need to tell your main Vue application to use the router.

1.  **Modify `src/main.js`:**

```javascript
// src/main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router' // Import the router

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(router) // Use the router
app.mount('#app')
```

**Explanation:**

*   We import the `router` we configured in `src/router/index.js`.
*   We use `app.use(router)` to install Vue Router as a plugin. This makes the router available throughout your application.

## Step 6: Using `<router-link>` and `<router-view>`

Now, you need to define where the content of your routes will be displayed and how users will navigate between them.

1.  **Modify `src/App.vue`:**

```vue
<!-- src/App.vue -->
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <nav>
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
    </nav>
    <router-view/>
  </div>
</template>

<style>
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

nav {
  padding: 30px;
}

nav a {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

nav a.router-link-exact-active {
  color: #42b983;
}
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`<router-link>`:**  This component is used to create links that navigate to different routes. The `to` prop specifies the route path.  It automatically handles preventing full page reloads.
*   **`<router-view>`:** This component acts as a placeholder where the content of the matched route will be rendered.  When you navigate to `/about`, the `AboutView` component will be displayed inside the `<router-view>`.
*   **`router-link-exact-active`:** This class is automatically added to the `<router-link>` that matches the current route.  You can use it to style the active link.

## Step 7: Running the Application

Start your development server:

```bash
npm run serve  (or yarn serve)
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` (or the port specified in your console). You should see the Home page.  Click the "About" link to navigate to the About page.

## Advanced Vue Router Features

Now that you have a basic understanding of Vue Router, let's explore some more advanced features.

### Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing allows you to create routes with parameters that can be used to display different content based on the URL.

1.  **Define a Dynamic Route:**

```javascript
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue';
import AboutView from '../views/AboutView.vue';
import UserView from '../views/UserView.vue'; // Import UserView

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeView
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: AboutView
  },
  {
    path: '/user/:id', // Dynamic route with a parameter named 'id'
    name: 'user',
    component: UserView
  }
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
  routes
});

export default router;
```

2.  **Create `UserView.vue`:**

```vue
<!-- src/views/UserView.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="user">
    <h1>User Details</h1>
    <p>User ID: {{ $route.params.id }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'UserView',
  mounted() {
    console.log('User ID:', this.$route.params.id); // Access the parameter in the component
  }
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`path: '/user/:id'`:**  The `:id` part of the path indicates a dynamic segment.  Any value placed in that segment will be available as the `id` parameter.
*   **`$route.params.id`:** Inside the `UserView` component, you can access the value of the `id` parameter using `$route.params.id`.  `$route` is a property of the Vue instance that provides information about the current route.

3.  **Using the Dynamic Route:**

In `App.vue` add a dynamic route link:

```vue
<!-- src/App.vue -->
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <nav>
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link> |
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link> |
      <router-link to="/user/123">User 123</router-link>
    </nav>
    <router-view/>
  </div>
</template>
```

Now, when you click the "User 123" link, you will navigate to `/user/123`, and the `UserView` component will display "User ID: 123".

### Named Routes

Named routes provide a convenient way to generate URLs and navigate programmatically using the route name instead of the path.

1.  **Use a Named Route in `<router-link>`:**

```vue
<!-- src/App.vue -->
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <nav>
      <router-link :to="{ name: 'home' }">Home</router-link> |
      <router-link :to="{ name: 'about' }">About</router-link> |
      <router-link :to="{ name: 'user', params: { id: 456 } }">User 456</router-link>
    </nav>
    <router-view/>
  </div>
</template>
```

**Explanation:**

*   Instead of `to="/about"`, we now use `to="{ name: 'about' }"`.  Vue Router will automatically resolve the URL based on the route name.
*   For dynamic routes, you need to provide the `params` object with the required parameters.

### Programmatic Navigation

You can navigate to different routes programmatically using the `router.push()` method. This is useful for scenarios like redirecting after a form submission or navigating based on user actions.

1.  **Programmatic Navigation in `HomeView.vue`:**

```vue
<!-- src/views/HomeView.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="home">
    <h1>Welcome to the Home Page!</h1>
    <button @click="goToAbout">Go to About Page</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router';

export default {
  name: 'HomeView',
  setup() {
    const router = useRouter();

    const goToAbout = () => {
      router.push({ name: 'about' }); // Navigate to the 'about' route
    };

    return { goToAbout };
  }
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`useRouter()`:** This is a composition API function that provides access to the router instance within a component's `setup()` function.
*   **`router.push()`:** This method programmatically navigates to a different route.  You can pass either a path string or a route object (with `name` and `params`).

You can also use `router.replace()` instead of `router.push()`.  `router.replace()` behaves like `router.push()`, but it replaces the current entry in the browser's history stack instead of adding a new one.

### Nested Routes

Nested routes allow you to create a hierarchical structure for your application. Imagine an admin section with various sub-sections. You could represent this using nested routes.

```javascript
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue';
import AboutView from '../views/AboutView.vue';
import AdminView from '../views/AdminView.vue';
import UsersView from '../views/UsersView.vue';
import ProductsView from '../views/ProductsView.vue';

const routes = [
    {
        path: '/',
        name: 'home',
        component: HomeView
    },
    {
        path: '/about',
        name: 'about',
        component: AboutView
    },
    {
        path: '/admin',
        name: 'admin',
        component: AdminView,
        children: [
            {
                path: 'users',
                name: 'admin-users',
                component: UsersView
            },
            {
                path: 'products',
                name: 'admin-products',
                component: ProductsView
            }
        ]
    }
];

const router = createRouter({
    history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
    routes
});

export default router;
```

Create the `AdminView.vue`, `UsersView.vue`, and `ProductsView.vue` components. Inside `AdminView.vue`, you'll place a `<router-view>` to render the `UsersView` or `ProductsView` components depending on the URL:

```vue
<!-- src/views/AdminView.vue -->
<template>
    <div class="admin">
        <h1>Admin Panel</h1>
        <nav>
            <router-link :to="{name: 'admin-users'}">Users</router-link> |
            <router-link :to="{name: 'admin-products'}">Products</router-link>
        </nav>
        <router-view/>
    </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    name: "AdminView"
}
</script>
```

### Route Meta Fields

Route meta fields allow you to attach arbitrary data to each route. This data can be used for various purposes, such as checking authentication status or customizing the page title.

1.  **Add Meta Fields:**

```javascript
// src/router/index.js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeView,
    meta: { requiresAuth: false } // Add a meta field
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: AboutView,
    meta: { requiresAuth: false }
  },
  {
    path: '/admin',
    name: 'admin',
    component: AdminView,
    meta: { requiresAuth: true }
  }
];
```

2.  **Access Meta Fields in a Navigation Guard:**

```javascript
// src/router/index.js
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  if (to.meta.requiresAuth) {
    // Check if the user is authenticated
    const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem('token'); // Example: check for a token

    if (isAuthenticated) {
      next(); // Allow access to the route
    } else {
      next('/login'); // Redirect to the login page
    }
  } else {
    next(); // Allow access to the route
  }
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`meta: { requiresAuth: true }`:**  We add a `requiresAuth` meta field to the admin route.
*   **`router.beforeEach()`:**  This is a navigation guard that runs before each route is accessed.
*   We check if the `requiresAuth` meta field is set to `true` and if the user is authenticated.  If not, we redirect them to the login page.
