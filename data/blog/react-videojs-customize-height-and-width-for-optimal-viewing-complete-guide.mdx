# React Video.js: Customize Height & Width for Optimal Viewing (Complete Guide)

Video.js is a popular and versatile open-source JavaScript library for embedding videos on websites. Integrating it into your React application offers a powerful way to manage video playback. One of the first customizations you'll likely need to make is adjusting the player's height and width to fit your design. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to achieve this, covering several methods and best practices for creating a responsive and visually pleasing video experience.

## Why Customize Video.js Dimensions?

By default, Video.js might not perfectly match your website's layout. Customizing the height and width allows you to:

- **Fit seamlessly into your design:** Avoid awkward gaps or overflows by ensuring the player dimensions complement your overall aesthetic.
- **Optimize for different screen sizes:** Create a responsive video player that adapts to various devices, providing a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Improve visual appeal:** A well-sized video player enhances the overall look and feel of your website, making it more engaging for visitors.
- **Enhance user experience:** Optimize the video display size for better viewing on any device.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:** These are essential for running a React project.
- **A React project:** You can create one using `create-react-app` or your preferred method.
- **`video.js` and `@videojs/themes` installed:**

  ```plaintext
  npm install video.js @videojs/themes
  # or
  yarn add video.js @videojs/themes
  ```

## Method 1: Inline Styles (Quick and Simple)

The simplest way to change the dimensions is by applying inline styles directly to the Video.js component. This is suitable for quick adjustments but might not be the best approach for more complex styling or responsive designs.

```plaintext
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import videojs from 'video.js'
import 'video.js/dist/video-js.css'
import '@videojs/themes/dist/city/index.css' // Optional: Add a theme

const VideoPlayer = (props) => {
  const videoRef = useRef(null)
  const playerRef = useRef(null)
  const { options, onReady } = props

  useEffect(() => {
    // Make sure Video.js player is only initialized once
    if (!playerRef.current) {
      const videoElement = videoRef.current

      if (!videoElement) return

      const player = (playerRef.current = videojs(videoElement, options, () => {
        onReady && onReady(player)
      }))

      // You can update the player in the `onReady` callback
      player.on('loadedmetadata', () => {
        console.log('loadedmetadata')
      })
    } else {
      // You can update the player options through props
      // and update the player
      const player = playerRef.current
      player.autoplay(options.autoplay)
      player.src(options.sources)
    }

    return () => {
      // Destroy player on unmount
      if (playerRef.current) {
        playerRef.current.dispose()
        playerRef.current = null
      }
    }
  }, [options, videoRef, onReady])

  return (
    <div data-vjs-player>
      <video
        ref={videoRef}
        className="video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-big-play-centered"
        style={{ width: '640px', height: '360px' }} // Inline Styles for Width and Height
        controls
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default VideoPlayer
```

In this example, the `style` attribute is used to set the `width` to `640px` and the `height` to `360px`. Replace these values with your desired dimensions. Remember to import both the core `video.js` css, and any themes you want to use.

**Pros:**

- Simple and straightforward.
- Good for quick adjustments.

**Cons:**

- Not ideal for responsive designs.
- Styles are tightly coupled to the component.
- Can become unwieldy for complex styling.

## Method 2: CSS Classes (Recommended for Flexibility)

A more robust approach involves using CSS classes to control the Video.js player's dimensions. This allows for better separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage styles, especially for responsive designs.

First, modify your React component:

```plaintext
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import videojs from 'video.js'
import 'video.js/dist/video-js.css'
import './VideoPlayer.css' // Import your CSS file

const VideoPlayer = (props) => {
  const videoRef = useRef(null)
  const playerRef = useRef(null)
  const { options, onReady } = props

  useEffect(() => {
    // Make sure Video.js player is only initialized once
    if (!playerRef.current) {
      const videoElement = videoRef.current

      if (!videoElement) return

      const player = (playerRef.current = videojs(videoElement, options, () => {
        onReady && onReady(player)
      }))

      // You can update the player in the `onReady` callback
      player.on('loadedmetadata', () => {
        console.log('loadedmetadata')
      })
    } else {
      // You can update the player options through props
      // and update the player
      const player = playerRef.current
      player.autoplay(options.autoplay)
      player.src(options.sources)
    }

    return () => {
      // Destroy player on unmount
      if (playerRef.current) {
        playerRef.current.dispose()
        playerRef.current = null
      }
    }
  }, [options, videoRef, onReady])

  return (
    <div data-vjs-player className="my-video-container">
      {' '}
      {/* Add a container class */}
      <video ref={videoRef} className="video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-big-play-centered" controls />
    </div>
  )
}

export default VideoPlayer
```

Create a CSS file (e.g., `VideoPlayer.css`) in the same directory as your component:

```plaintext
.my-video-container {
  width: 80%; /* Example: 80% of its parent container */
  max-width: 1280px; /* Set a max-width if needed */
  height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
  margin: 0 auto; /* Center the player */
}

.my-video-container .video-js { /* Target video.js player specifically */
  width: 100% !important; /* Ensure video fills the container */
  height: 100% !important; /* Ensure video fills the container */
}

/* Media query for smaller screens (e.g., mobile) */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .my-video-container {
    width: 100%; /* Full width on smaller screens */
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`.my-video-container`:** This class wraps the entire video player and controls its overall dimensions and responsiveness. Setting `width` to a percentage allows the player to scale with its parent container. `height: auto` maintains the video's aspect ratio. `margin: 0 auto` helps center the player horizontally.
- **`.my-video-container .video-js`:** This targets the `video-js` class (automatically added by Video.js) _within_ the container. Setting `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` ensures the Video.js player fills the entire container. The `!important` rule is often necessary to override default Video.js styles.
- **Media Queries:** The `@media` rule allows you to define different styles for different screen sizes. In this example, the video player takes up the full width of the screen on devices with a screen width of 768 pixels or less.

**Pros:**

- More organized and maintainable styling.
- Easier to create responsive designs using media queries.
- Separation of concerns (styles are in a separate file).

**Cons:**

- Requires creating and managing CSS files.

## Method 3: JavaScript-Based Dimension Adjustment (Dynamic Control)

For scenarios requiring more dynamic control over the player's dimensions (e.g., based on user interaction or data changes), you can use JavaScript to manipulate the player's size. This approach provides the most flexibility but can also be more complex.

```plaintext
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState, useCallback } from 'react'
import videojs from 'video.js'
import 'video.js/dist/video-js.css'

const VideoPlayer = (props) => {
  const videoRef = useRef(null)
  const playerRef = useRef(null)
  const { options, onReady } = props
  const [playerWidth, setPlayerWidth] = useState('640px')
  const [playerHeight, setPlayerHeight] = useState('360px')

  const updateDimensions = useCallback(() => {
    // Example: Update dimensions based on window size
    setPlayerWidth(window.innerWidth < 768 ? '100%' : '800px')
    setPlayerHeight(window.innerWidth < 768 ? 'auto' : '450px')
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('resize', updateDimensions)
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', updateDimensions)
  }, [updateDimensions])

  useEffect(() => {
    updateDimensions()
  }, [updateDimensions])

  useEffect(() => {
    // Make sure Video.js player is only initialized once
    if (!playerRef.current) {
      const videoElement = videoRef.current

      if (!videoElement) return

      const player = (playerRef.current = videojs(videoElement, options, () => {
        onReady && onReady(player)
      }))

      // You can update the player in the `onReady` callback
      player.on('loadedmetadata', () => {
        console.log('loadedmetadata')
      })
    } else {
      // You can update the player options through props
      // and update the player
      const player = playerRef.current
      player.autoplay(options.autoplay)
      player.src(options.sources)
      player.width(playerWidth)
      player.height(playerHeight)
    }

    return () => {
      // Destroy player on unmount
      if (playerRef.current) {
        playerRef.current.dispose()
        playerRef.current = null
      }
    }
  }, [options, videoRef, onReady, playerWidth, playerHeight])

  return (
    <div data-vjs-player>
      <video
        ref={videoRef}
        className="video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-big-play-centered"
        controls
        style={{ width: playerWidth, height: playerHeight }} // Dynamic height and width
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default VideoPlayer
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **State Variables:** `playerWidth` and `playerHeight` are React state variables that store the current width and height of the player.
2.  **`updateDimensions` function**: This function calculates new height and width values based on the window size. It uses a callback to update these values.
3.  **`useEffect` with resize listener**: This `useEffect` hook listens to resize events on the window. When a resize event occurs, `updateDimensions` will update the state, re-rendering the component. The return function removes the event listener when the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks.
4.  **`useEffect` dependency array including `playerWidth`, `playerHeight`**: This hook is triggered whenever `playerWidth` or `playerHeight` changes. It updates the inline style on the video element. It also calls `player.width(playerWidth)` and `player.height(playerHeight)` _after_ the player has been initialized. This method ensures that the video.js library gets updated whenever the dimensions change.
5.  **Inline Style Binding:** The `style` attribute of the `<video>` element is bound to the `playerWidth` and `playerHeight` state variables. This ensures that the video player's dimensions update whenever these state variables change.

**Pros:**

- Most flexible approach.
- Allows for dynamic control over dimensions.
- Can be used to implement complex responsive behaviors.

**Cons:**

- More complex to implement.
- Requires managing state and event listeners.

## Important Considerations:

- **Aspect Ratio:** When setting the height and width, consider maintaining the video's aspect ratio to avoid distortion. Use CSS properties like `height: auto` and `object-fit: contain` to control how the video fits within its container.
- **Responsiveness:** Employ media queries or JavaScript-based resizing to ensure the video player adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Performance:** Avoid excessive re-renders when using JavaScript-based dimension adjustment. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to optimize performance.
- **Video.js Options**: Consider the video.js `fluid` option for easier responsiveness. If `fluid` is true, the video player will take up the full width of its container and adjust its height to maintain the aspect ratio.

## Best Practices:

- **Use CSS classes for styling:** This provides the best balance between flexibility and maintainability.
- **Employ media queries for responsiveness:** This ensures a consistent user experience across different devices.
- **Consider using a CSS framework:** Frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS can simplify the process of creating responsive layouts.
- **Test on different devices and browsers:** Verify that your video player renders correctly on various platforms.
