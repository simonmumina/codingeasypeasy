This comprehensive guide will walk you through the top 10 most frequently asked coding interview questions, providing detailed explanations, code examples in JavaScript, and helpful tips to boost your confidence and improve your performance.

## Why Focus on These Questions?

While every interview is unique, certain patterns and topics frequently appear. Mastering these core concepts will not only help you answer specific questions but also develop a strong foundation for tackling any coding challenge. We've carefully curated this list based on frequency, complexity, and the underlying principles they test.

## The Top 10 Coding Interview Questions:

1.  **Two Sum:**
2.  **Valid Palindrome:**
3.  **Reverse Linked List:**
4.  **Binary Tree Inorder Traversal:**
5.  **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree:**
6.  **Merge Two Sorted Arrays:**
7.  **FizzBuzz:**
8.  **String Anagrams:**
9.  **Implement Queue using Stacks:**
10. **Fibonacci Sequence (Iterative & Recursive):**

Let's dive into each question with a detailed explanation, code examples, and valuable tips.

### 1. Two Sum

**Question:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Explanation:**

The most efficient solution uses a hash map (object in JavaScript) to store the numbers we've seen and their indices. For each number, we check if the complement (target - number) exists in the map. If it does, we've found our pair.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const numMap = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        if (complement in numMap) {
            return [numMap[complement], i];
        }
        numMap[nums[i]] = i;
    }
    return []; // No solution found
};

console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

**Tips:**

- Understand the trade-offs between time and space complexity. The hash map solution offers O(n) time complexity but requires O(n) space.
- Clearly explain your reasoning for choosing the hash map approach over a brute-force (O(n^2)) solution.
- Handle edge cases, such as when no solution exists or when the input array is empty.

### 2. Valid Palindrome

**Question:** Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

**Explanation:**

The core idea is to filter the string to keep only alphanumeric characters, convert it to lowercase, and then compare the string with its reversed version.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isPalindrome = function(s) {
    const cleanedString = s.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
    const reversedString = cleanedString.split('').reverse().join('');
    return cleanedString === reversedString;
};

console.log(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // Output: true
console.log(isPalindrome("race a car")); // Output: false
```

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with only one character (which are considered palindromes).
- Use regular expressions for efficient filtering of non-alphanumeric characters.
- Consider a two-pointer approach for a more efficient comparison (iterating from both ends of the string).

### 3. Reverse Linked List

**Question:** Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

**Explanation:**

This problem involves iteratively changing the `next` pointers of each node to point to the previous node. We need to keep track of the current node, the previous node, and the next node.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
const reverseList = function(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let current = head;
    let next = null;

    while (current) {
        next = current.next;  // Store the next node
        current.next = prev; // Reverse the pointer
        prev = current;       // Move prev one step forward
        current = next;       // Move current one step forward
    }

    return prev; // prev will be the new head
};

// Example usage (assuming ListNode is defined):
function ListNode(val, next) {
     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 }

const head = new ListNode(1, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(3, new ListNode(4, new ListNode(5)))));

let reversedHead = reverseList(head);

// Print the reversed list (optional)
let current = reversedHead;
while (current) {
    console.log(current.val);
    current = current.next;
}
```

**Tips:**

- Visualizing the linked list and the pointer changes is crucial for understanding the algorithm. Draw diagrams!
- Carefully manage the `prev`, `current`, and `next` pointers to avoid losing track of the list.
- Handle edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one node.

### 4. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

**Question:** Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the inorder traversal of its nodes' values_.

**Explanation:**

Inorder traversal visits the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. We can implement this recursively or iteratively using a stack.

**JavaScript Code (Recursive):**

```plaintext
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const inorderTraversal = function(root) {
    const result = [];

    function traverse(node) {
        if (node) {
            traverse(node.left);
            result.push(node.val);
            traverse(node.right);
        }
    }

    traverse(root);
    return result;
};

// Example Usage (Assuming TreeNode is defined):
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 }

const root = new TreeNode(1, null, new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(3), null));

console.log(inorderTraversal(root)); // Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

**JavaScript Code (Iterative using Stack):**

```plaintext
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const inorderTraversalIterative = function(root) {
    const result = [];
    const stack = [];
    let current = root;

    while (current || stack.length > 0) {
        while (current) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }

        current = stack.pop();
        result.push(current.val);
        current = current.right;
    }

    return result;
};
```

**Tips:**

- Understand the different types of tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder) and their applications.
- Be prepared to implement both recursive and iterative solutions. The iterative solution often demonstrates a deeper understanding of the underlying data structure.
- Explain the time and space complexity of each approach.

### 5. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

**Question:** Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth_.

**Explanation:**

The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. This can be solved recursively using Depth-First Search (DFS).

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
const maxDepth = function(root) {
    if (!root) {
        return 0;
    }

    const leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
    const rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);

    return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
};

// Example Usage (Assuming TreeNode is defined):
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 }

const root = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(9), new TreeNode(20, new TreeNode(15), new TreeNode(7)));
console.log(maxDepth(root)); // Output: 3
```

**Tips:**

- Clearly explain the recursive approach and how it explores the tree.
- Consider the base case: when the node is null (empty tree), the depth is 0.
- Explain the time and space complexity (O(n) for both in the worst case).

### 6. Merge Two Sorted Arrays

**Question:** You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Note:** The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array `nums1`_. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

**Explanation:**

The most efficient approach is to merge the arrays from the end, avoiding the need to shift elements in `nums1`. We use three pointers: one for `nums1` (from the end), one for `nums1` (the valid part), and one for `nums2`.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
 */
const merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
    let i = m - 1;   // Pointer for nums1 (valid part)
    let j = n - 1;   // Pointer for nums2
    let k = m + n - 1; // Pointer for nums1 (from the end)

    while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
        if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
            nums1[k] = nums1[i];
            i--;
        } else {
            nums1[k] = nums2[j];
            j--;
        }
        k--;
    }

    // Copy any remaining elements from nums2 to nums1
    while (j >= 0) {
        nums1[k] = nums2[j];
        j--;
        k--;
    }
};

// Example Usage:
let nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0];
let m = 3;
let nums2 = [2,5,6];
let n = 3;

merge(nums1, m, nums2, n);
console.log(nums1); // Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

**Tips:**

- Understand why merging from the end is more efficient (avoids shifting).
- Handle the edge case where one of the arrays is empty.
- Be careful with pointer arithmetic.

### 7. FizzBuzz

**Question:** Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (1-indexed) where:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by 3 and 5.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by 3.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by 5.
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```

**Explanation:**

This is a simple problem that tests your understanding of basic conditional logic and modulo operator.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string[]}
 */
const fizzBuzz = function(n) {
    const answer = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            answer.push("FizzBuzz");
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
            answer.push("Fizz");
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
            answer.push("Buzz");
        } else {
            answer.push(String(i));
        }
    }
    return answer;
};

console.log(fizzBuzz(15)); // Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```

**Tips:**

- Pay attention to the order of the conditions. `FizzBuzz` must be checked first to avoid incorrect results.
- Ensure you are converting the number to a string when necessary.
- This can be used to evaluate basic coding competency and attention to detail.

### 8. String Anagrams

**Question:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

**Explanation:**

One common approach is to use a character frequency count. We create a map (object in JavaScript) to store the frequency of each character in the first string. Then, we iterate through the second string, decrementing the counts in the map. If all counts are zero at the end, the strings are anagrams.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }

    const charCounts = {};

    for (const char of s) {
        charCounts[char] = (charCounts[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    for (const char of t) {
        if (!charCounts[char]) {
            return false;
        }
        charCounts[char]--;
    }

    return true;
};

console.log(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")); // Output: true
console.log(isAnagram("rat", "car"));       // Output: false
```

**Tips:**

- Check if the lengths of the strings are different. If they are, they cannot be anagrams.
- Consider using sorting as an alternative approach, but frequency counting is generally more efficient.
- Explain the time and space complexity of your solution (O(n) in this case).

### 9. Implement Queue using Stacks

**Question:** Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

**Explanation:**

The key idea is to use one stack for enqueue operations (`push`) and another stack for dequeue operations (`pop`, `peek`). When we need to dequeue, we transfer all elements from the enqueue stack to the dequeue stack (if it's empty). This reverses the order of elements, effectively simulating a queue.

**JavaScript Code:**

```plaintext
class MyQueue {
    constructor() {
        this.enqueueStack = [];
        this.dequeueStack = [];
    }

    /**
     * @param {number} x
     * @return {void}
     */
    push(x) {
        this.enqueueStack.push(x);
    }

    /**
     * @return {number}
     */
    pop() {
        if (this.dequeueStack.length === 0) {
            while (this.enqueueStack.length > 0) {
                this.dequeueStack.push(this.enqueueStack.pop());
            }
        }
        return this.dequeueStack.pop() || null; // Return null if still empty
    }

    /**
     * @return {number}
     */
    peek() {
        if (this.dequeueStack.length === 0) {
            while (this.enqueueStack.length > 0) {
                this.dequeueStack.push(this.enqueueStack.pop());
            }
        }
        return this.dequeueStack[this.dequeueStack.length - 1] || null; // Return null if still empty
    }

    /**
     * @return {boolean}
     */
    empty() {
        return this.enqueueStack.length === 0 && this.dequeueStack.length === 0;
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new MyQueue()
 * obj.push(x)
 * var param_2 = obj.pop()
 * var param_3 = obj.peek()
 * var param_4 = obj.empty()
 */

// Example Usage:
const queue = new MyQueue();
queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);
console.log(queue.peek());   // Output: 1
console.log(queue.pop());    // Output: 1
console.log(queue.empty());  // Output: false
```

**Tips:**

- Understand the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) nature of stacks and how to manipulate them to simulate FIFO behavior.
- Clearly explain the transfer process between the two stacks.
- Consider the case where the dequeue stack is empty.

### 10. Fibonacci Sequence (Iterative & Recursive)

**Question:** Write a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Implement both recursive and iterative solutions.

**Explanation:**

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (usually starting with 0 and 1).

**JavaScript Code (Recursive):**

```plaintext
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
const fibonacciRecursive = function(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacciRecursive(n - 1) + fibonacciRecursive(n - 2);
};

console.log(fibonacciRecursive(10)); // Output: 55
```

**JavaScript Code (Iterative):**

```plaintext
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
const fibonacciIterative = function(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }

    let a = 0;
    let b = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        const temp = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }
    return b;
};

console.log(fibonacciIterative(10)); // Output: 55
```

**Tips:**

- Understand the recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Explain the inefficiency of the recursive solution due to redundant calculations (exponential time complexity).
- The iterative solution is much more efficient (linear time complexity).
- Discuss memoization as a way to optimize the recursive solution.
