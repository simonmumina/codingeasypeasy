# NestJS CSRF Protection: Secure Your APIs with a Practical Implementation Guide

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a common web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions they do not intend to.  Protecting your NestJS APIs from CSRF attacks is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your application and the security of your users' data. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of implementing effective CSRF protection in your NestJS applications, providing practical code examples and best practices along the way.

## What is CSRF and Why is it a Threat?

CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a website has in a user's browser.  An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting malicious requests to a website on which they are authenticated. For example, a user might be logged into their banking website.  An attacker can craft a malicious email with a hidden form that, when rendered by the user's browser, sends a request to the banking website to transfer funds to the attacker's account.  Because the user is already authenticated, the banking website processes the request as if it were legitimate.

**Key takeaways about CSRF:**

*   **Leverages Existing Authentication:**  It exploits the user's established session.
*   **Silent Attack:**  The user might be unaware that they are being attacked.
*   **Significant Impact:**  Can lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, and account compromise.

## CSRF Protection Strategies

The primary defense against CSRF attacks involves using techniques that prevent attackers from crafting valid requests from external sites. The most common and effective strategy is to use **synchronizer tokens**, often referred to as CSRF tokens.

**Here's how CSRF tokens work:**

1.  **Token Generation:** The server generates a unique, unpredictable token for each user session (or sometimes per request).

2.  **Token Embedding:** The token is embedded in the HTML form (or as a request header) on the server-rendered pages that perform state-changing operations (e.g., submitting a form, making an API call that modifies data).

3.  **Token Validation:** When the user submits the form or makes an API request, the server verifies that the token included in the request matches the token stored in the user's session.

4.  **Rejection of Mismatched Tokens:** If the tokens don't match, the request is rejected, preventing the CSRF attack.

## Implementing CSRF Protection in NestJS

Let's dive into a practical implementation using NestJS. We'll cover generating, storing, and validating CSRF tokens.

**1. Install Dependencies:**

First, install the necessary packages. We'll use the `csurf` package for CSRF token generation and management and `cookie-parser` to parse cookies.

```bash
npm install csurf cookie-parser
npm install -D @types/csurf @types/cookie-parser
```

**2. Configure `cookie-parser` Middleware:**

In your `main.ts` (or wherever you bootstrap your NestJS application), configure the `cookie-parser` middleware.  This middleware allows your application to parse cookies from incoming requests, which is crucial for storing and retrieving the CSRF token.

```typescript
// src/main.ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import * as cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.use(cookieParser());
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

**3. Create a CSRF Guard:**

Next, create a NestJS guard to handle CSRF token generation and validation. This guard will intercept incoming requests and verify the CSRF token.

```typescript
// src/guards/csrf.guard.ts
import {
  Injectable,
  CanActivate,
  ExecutionContext,
  ForbiddenException,
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request } from 'express';
import * as csurf from 'csurf';

@Injectable()
export class CsrfGuard implements CanActivate {
  private readonly csrfProtection = csurf({
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'strict', // Important for security
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // Enable in production for HTTPS
    },
    value: (req: Request) => {
      return req.headers['x-csrf-token'] || req.headers['x-xsrf-token'] || req.cookies['XSRF-TOKEN']; // Look for token in headers or cookie
    }
  });

  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const request: Request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const response = context.switchToHttp().getResponse();

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.csrfProtection(request, response, (err: any) => {
        if (err) {
          if (err.code === 'EBADCSRFTOKEN') {
            reject(new ForbiddenException('CSRF token validation failed'));
          } else {
            reject(err);
          }
        } else {
          resolve(true);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`csurf` Initialization:** The `csurf` middleware is initialized with options:
    *   `cookie`:  Configures how the CSRF token cookie is handled.  `httpOnly: true` prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie (enhanced security).  `sameSite: 'strict'` prevents the cookie from being sent with cross-site requests (crucial for CSRF protection). `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` enables the cookie's `secure` flag only in production (requires HTTPS).
    *   `value`: This function defines how the CSRF token is extracted from the request.  It checks for the token in the `x-csrf-token` header, the `x-xsrf-token` header (Angular compatibility), or the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie.  This flexibility allows your front-end to send the token in either a header or a cookie.
*   **`canActivate` Method:** This method is the core of the guard. It intercepts the request and applies the `csrfProtection` middleware.
*   **Promise-Based Handling:**  The `csurf` middleware is Express-style, using a callback.  We wrap it in a `Promise` to integrate seamlessly with NestJS's asynchronous guard mechanism.
*   **Error Handling:**  If the CSRF token validation fails (e.g., token mismatch), a `ForbiddenException` is thrown, indicating that the request is unauthorized.

**4.  Create a Controller to Generate a CSRF Token:**

You need an endpoint that the client can call to retrieve the CSRF token initially.  This endpoint should set the CSRF token as a cookie.

```typescript
// src/controllers/csrf.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Res, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Response } from 'express';
import { CsrfGuard } from '../guards/csrf.guard';

@Controller('csrf')
export class CsrfController {
  @Get('token')
  getCsrfToken(@Res() res: Response): any {
    const csrfToken = res.locals.csrfToken; // Get the token from res.locals
    return res.json({ csrfToken });
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`@Res()` Decorator:**  We use the `@Res()` decorator to access the Express `Response` object directly.
*   **`res.locals.csrfToken`:**  The `csurf` middleware automatically populates `res.locals.csrfToken` with the generated CSRF token.
*   **Returning the Token:** The endpoint returns the CSRF token as a JSON object. Your front-end application will then retrieve this token and store it in a cookie or send it in a header with subsequent requests.

**5. Register the Guard and Controller in AppModule:**

```typescript
// src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { CsrfGuard } from './guards/csrf.guard';
import { APP_GUARD } from '@nestjs/core';
import { CsrfController } from './controllers/csrf.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController, CsrfController],
  providers: [
    AppService,
    {
      provide: APP_GUARD,
      useClass: CsrfGuard,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`APP_GUARD`:**  The `APP_GUARD` provider registers the `CsrfGuard` globally. This means that *every* route in your application will be protected by the CSRF guard. You can also apply the guard to specific controllers or routes using the `@UseGuards(CsrfGuard)` decorator.

**6. Protect Your API Endpoints:**

Now, apply the `CsrfGuard` to the endpoints you want to protect.  If you've registered it globally as shown above, all routes are protected. Otherwise, use `@UseGuards`.

```typescript
// src/app.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { CsrfGuard } from './guards/csrf.guard';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.getHello();
  }

  @Post('data')
  @UseGuards(CsrfGuard) // Apply to specific routes if not global
  postData(@Body() data: any): any {
    console.log('Received data:', data);
    return { message: 'Data received successfully' };
  }
}
```

**7. Front-End Implementation (Example using JavaScript):**

Here's how you would typically handle the CSRF token on the front-end using JavaScript (example with `fetch` API):

```javascript
// Function to get the CSRF token from the server
async function getCsrfToken() {
  const response = await fetch('/csrf/token');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.csrfToken;
}

// Function to make a POST request with the CSRF token in the header
async function postData(data) {
  const csrfToken = await getCsrfToken();

  const response = await fetch('/data', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-csrf-token': csrfToken, // Send token in the header
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  console.log(result);
}

// Example usage
postData({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 });
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`getCsrfToken()`:**  This function fetches the CSRF token from the `/csrf/token` endpoint.
*   **`postData()`:** This function makes a `POST` request to `/data`, including the CSRF token in the `x-csrf-token` header.  Alternatively, you could store the token in a cookie named `XSRF-TOKEN`.

## Best Practices and Considerations

*   **HTTPS is Essential:** CSRF protection is significantly more effective when your website uses HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client and the server, preventing attackers from intercepting the CSRF token.  Ensure you have properly configured HTTPS in your production environment.
*   **`sameSite` Attribute:**  Use the `sameSite` attribute on your CSRF token cookie.  Setting it to `strict` is generally recommended.  `lax` can provide a better user experience in some cases but reduces security. `none` requires the `Secure` attribute and is generally not recommended unless you understand the implications.
*   **Short Token Expiration:** Consider setting a relatively short expiration time for CSRF tokens to further mitigate the risk of attacks.
*   **Rotate Tokens Regularly:**  Regularly rotate CSRF tokens to reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.
*   **Double Submit Cookie:** Another CSRF prevention technique is the Double Submit Cookie. This involves setting a cookie with a random value and also including that value in a request header. The server verifies that the cookie value and the header value match.  This is less robust than synchronizer tokens but can be easier to implement in certain scenarios. However, It is not recommended anymore.
*   **Stateless APIs (JWTs):**  For stateless APIs that use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), CSRF protection is less relevant because each request includes the authentication token, which is signed and verified by the server. However, JWTs are still vulnerable to XSS attacks, so XSS protection remains crucial.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your CSRF protection implementation to ensure it functions correctly and effectively.  Use automated testing tools and manual testing techniques.
*   **Consider an Existing Library:** Libraries like `csurf` are well-tested and actively maintained and often offer a more secure and efficient solution than rolling your own.
