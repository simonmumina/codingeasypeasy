# Yarn Builder CLI: Streamlining Your Project Builds and Workflows

The `@yarnpkg/builder` CLI is a powerful tool within the Yarn ecosystem designed to simplify and automate build processes, particularly useful in monorepo environments. It provides a structured way to define and execute build steps, manage dependencies, and ensure consistent builds across your projects. This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up and using the Yarn Builder CLI, covering common use cases, advanced features, and best practices.

## What is `@yarnpkg/builder`?

At its core, `@yarnpkg/builder` is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to define and execute build commands in a declarative and repeatable manner. It integrates seamlessly with Yarn workspaces, making it ideal for managing complex monorepo projects. By abstracting away the intricacies of build processes, it promotes consistency, reduces errors, and accelerates development cycles.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Simplified Build Definitions:** Define build processes using simple, declarative configuration files.
- **Parallel Execution:** Leverages Yarn's workspace awareness to execute builds in parallel, significantly reducing build times.
- **Dependency Management:** Ensures correct dependencies are installed and linked before builds are executed.
- **Task Scheduling & Orchestration:** Define dependencies between build tasks and automatically orchestrate their execution order.
- **Monorepo Optimization:** Designed specifically for monorepo workflows, providing optimized performance and dependency management.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across different operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- **Extensibility:** Supports custom builders and tasks to tailor the tool to your specific needs.

## Getting Started: Installation and Setup

First, you need to ensure you have Yarn installed. If you don't, you can install it globally using npm:

```plaintext
npm install -g yarn
```

Next, you need to install the `@yarnpkg/builder` CLI:

```plaintext
yarn add -D @yarnpkg/builder
```

This installs the builder as a development dependency in your project. Now you can access the CLI through the `yarn builder` command.

## Defining Your Build Process: `builder.yml`

The heart of `@yarnpkg/builder` is the `builder.yml` file, which resides in the root of your project (or a workspace). This file defines the tasks that make up your build process.

Here's a basic example:

```plaintext
# builder.yml
version: 1

tasks:
  build:
    script: tsc
    description: Compiles the TypeScript code.

  lint:
    script: eslint .
    description: Lints the codebase.

  test:
    script: jest
    description: Runs unit tests.

  all:
    dependsOn: [build, lint, test]
    description: Runs all build tasks.
```

**Explanation:**

- **`version`:** Specifies the version of the `builder.yml` schema. Always start with `1`.
- **`tasks`:** A map of task names to their definitions.
- **`build`, `lint`, `test`, `all`:** These are task names. You can choose any name that is descriptive of the task.
- **`script`:** The command to execute for the task. This is typically a shell command.
- **`description`:** A human-readable description of the task, helpful for documentation.
- **`dependsOn`:** An array of task names that must be completed before the current task can be executed. The `all` task depends on `build`, `lint`, and `test`, ensuring they are executed in that order (or in parallel if possible).

## Running Your Build: Using the CLI

To run a specific task, use the following command:

```plaintext
yarn builder run <task_name>
```

For example, to run the `build` task:

```plaintext
yarn builder run build
```

To run all tasks defined in the `all` task (or any other task that depends on other tasks):

```plaintext
yarn builder run all
```

The CLI will execute the specified task and any tasks it depends on, automatically managing the order of execution.

## Advanced Features and Configuration Options

The `builder.yml` file supports a range of advanced configuration options to customize your build process:

- **`cwd`:** Specifies the working directory for the task. This is useful for tasks that need to be executed in a specific directory within your project.

  ```plaintext
  tasks:
    build:
      script: tsc
      cwd: ./src
      description: Compiles the TypeScript code from the src directory.
  ```

- **`env`:** Defines environment variables to be set for the task.

  ```plaintext
  tasks:
    test:
      script: jest
      env:
        NODE_ENV: test
      description: Runs unit tests with NODE_ENV set to test.
  ```

- **`cache`:** Configures caching for the task to improve build performance. Yarn Builder CLI utilizes build caching which can drastically improve your build times.

  ```plaintext
  tasks:
    build:
      script: tsc
      cache: true # Simple boolean value
      description: Compiles the TypeScript code, caching the results.
  ```

  You can also configure cache paths:

  ```plaintext
  tasks:
    build:
      script: tsc
      cache:
        paths: ['lib'] # Cache the 'lib' directory
      description: Compiles the TypeScript code, caching the results.
  ```

- **`concurrency`**: Specifies the maximum number of tasks that can be executed in parallel. This is useful for controlling resource usage and preventing overloading your system.

  ```plaintext
  tasks:
    all:
      dependsOn: [build, lint, test]
      concurrency: 2 # Run a maximum of 2 tasks concurrently
      description: Runs all build tasks with a concurrency limit.
  ```

- **`inputs` and `outputs`**: These options fine-tune the caching mechanism by specifying which files or directories are considered as inputs and which are outputs. This allows for more precise cache invalidation and improved performance.

  ```plaintext
  tasks:
    build:
      script: tsc
      inputs: ['src/**/*.ts', 'tsconfig.json']
      outputs: ['lib']
      description: Compiles TypeScript code and caches based on input and output files.
  ```

## Monorepo Support: Building Workspaces

One of the key strengths of `@yarnpkg/builder` is its excellent support for monorepo environments. It automatically detects Yarn workspaces and can build them in parallel, optimizing the build process for large, multi-package projects.

To build all workspaces in your monorepo, you can use the following command:

```plaintext
yarn builder run all --workspaces
```

This command will execute the `all` task (or any other specified task) in each workspace that has a `builder.yml` file. The CLI will automatically manage dependencies between workspaces and execute builds in the correct order.

If you want to build specific workspaces, you can specify them using the `--workspace` flag:

```plaintext
yarn builder run build --workspace my-package-a --workspace my-package-b
```

This command will only execute the `build` task in the `my-package-a` and `my-package-b` workspaces.

## Custom Builders and Tasks

For more complex scenarios, you can extend `@yarnpkg/builder` with custom builders and tasks. This allows you to integrate your own tooling and logic into the build process.

While a full example of custom builder creation is beyond the scope of this introductory guide, you can refer to the Yarn documentation and community resources for detailed instructions on how to implement custom builders.

## Best Practices

- **Keep your `builder.yml` files organized and well-documented.** Use descriptive task names and descriptions to make it easy for others to understand the build process.
- **Leverage caching to improve build performance.** Identify tasks that can be cached and configure caching appropriately.
- **Use parallel execution to speed up builds.** Take advantage of Yarn's workspace awareness to execute builds in parallel.
- **Test your build process thoroughly.** Ensure that your build process is reliable and produces the expected results.
- **Consider using environment variables to configure your build process.** This makes it easier to adapt your builds to different environments.

## Conclusion

The `@yarnpkg/builder` CLI is a valuable tool for streamlining your project builds and workflows, especially in monorepo environments. By using a declarative configuration file and leveraging Yarn's workspace awareness, you can simplify build definitions, optimize build performance, and ensure consistent builds across your projects. Start experimenting with `@yarnpkg/builder` today and unlock its potential for efficient and reliable JavaScript and TypeScript development.
