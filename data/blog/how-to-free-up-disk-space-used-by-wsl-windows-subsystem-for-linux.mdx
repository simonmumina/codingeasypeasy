# How to Free Up Disk Space Used by WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a powerful tool that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the overhead of a virtual machine. However, WSL distributions can sometimes consume a significant amount of disk space, especially as you install more packages and work with larger files. This blog post provides a detailed guide on how to reclaim and manage disk space used by WSL.

## Understanding WSL's Disk Usage

WSL distributions are stored as virtual hard drives (VHDXs) on your Windows file system. These VHDXs dynamically grow as you add data to your Linux environment. The problem is, even after you delete files _inside_ your WSL environment, the VHDX file might not automatically shrink. This leads to wasted disk space.

## Methods for Freeing Up Disk Space in WSL

Here are several methods to reclaim disk space used by WSL:

### 1. Clean Up Unnecessary Files Inside Your WSL Distribution

The first and most obvious step is to remove any unnecessary files and packages within your WSL environment. Use standard Linux commands to identify and delete unused data:

- **Remove obsolete packages:**

  ```plaintext
  sudo apt autoremove # For Debian/Ubuntu based distros
  sudo dnf autoremove # For Fedora based distros
  sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq) # For Arch Linux based distros
  ```

- **Clean apt cache (Debian/Ubuntu):**

  ```plaintext
  sudo apt clean
  sudo apt autoclean
  ```

- **Find and delete large files:** Use the `du` (disk usage) and `sort` commands to locate large files:

  ```plaintext
  du -sh /* | sort -hr | head -n 20
  ```

  This command lists the 20 largest directories in your root directory. From there, you can navigate to specific directories and identify larger individual files to delete using `rm`. **Be careful when deleting files â€“ ensure you know what you're deleting!**

  ```plaintext
  rm /path/to/large/file
  ```

### 2. Compacting the WSL Virtual Hard Drive (VHDX)

After deleting files within your WSL environment, you need to compact the VHDX file to reclaim the space on your Windows drive. This is the most effective method for freeing up significant amounts of disk space.

**Steps to Compact the VHDX:**

1.  **Terminate the WSL distribution:** Before compacting, you need to ensure that the WSL distribution is completely shut down. Use the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

    This command shuts down all running WSL distributions.

2.  **Identify the VHDX file path:** The location of the VHDX file varies depending on your WSL distribution. Typically, it is located in a hidden directory under your user profile. Use the following command in PowerShell to find the path:

    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Packages\*<YourDistributionName>*\LocalState\ -Filter *.vhdx -Recurse
    ```

    Replace `<YourDistributionName>` with the actual name of your WSL distribution package. For example, if you're using Ubuntu, it might be something like `CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu20.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc`. You can find the exact name in the output of `wsl -l -v`.

    The output will show you the full path to the `ext4.vhdx` or similar file. This is the file you'll be compacting.

3.  **Optimize the VHDX using `diskpart`:** `diskpart` is a Windows command-line tool for managing disks. Use it to compact the VHDX. Replace `<VHDX_PATH>` with the path you identified in the previous step.

    ```powershell
    diskpart
    ```

    Within the `diskpart` prompt, enter the following commands:

    ```diskpart
    select vdisk file="<VHDX_PATH>"
    attach vdisk readonly
    compact vdisk
    detach vdisk
    exit
    ```

    - `select vdisk file="<VHDX_PATH>"`: Selects the VHDX file you want to compact.
    - `attach vdisk readonly`: Attaches the VHDX in read-only mode. This is crucial for safe compaction.
    - `compact vdisk`: Performs the actual compaction operation.
    - `detach vdisk`: Detaches the VHDX.
    - `exit`: Exits the `diskpart` utility.

    The compaction process may take some time, depending on the size of the VHDX and the amount of space to be reclaimed.

4.  **Restart WSL:** Once the `diskpart` commands have completed, restart your WSL distribution.

    ```powershell
    wsl ~
    ```

### 3. Using `wsl --optimize-vhd` (WSL 2 Feature - Requires Windows 11/Server 2022 or newer)

A more streamlined approach to compacting the VHDX is available in newer versions of WSL 2. This method simplifies the process and handles some of the underlying steps automatically.

1.  **Ensure WSL 2 is running:** Check your WSL version using `wsl -l -v`. If your distribution is running WSL 1, you'll need to convert it to WSL 2 using `wsl --set-version <DistributionName> 2`. Be aware that converting to WSL 2 might take some time.

2.  **Shutdown WSL:** As with the previous method, shut down WSL:

    ```powershell
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

3.  **Optimize VHD:** Use the `--optimize-vhd` command followed by the path to the VHDX. This requires elevated privileges (Run as Administrator).

    ```powershell
    wsl --optimize-vhd <VHDX_PATH>
    ```

    Replace `<VHDX_PATH>` with the path you identified earlier. This command performs the compaction operation directly.

4.  **Restart WSL:** After optimization, restart your WSL distribution:

    ```powershell
    wsl ~
    ```

### 4. Moving Your WSL Distribution to Another Drive

If your primary drive (typically C:) is running low on space, you can move your WSL distribution to another drive with more available storage. This involves exporting the distribution, unregistering it, and then importing it to the new location.

1.  **Export the WSL distribution:** Use the `wsl --export` command to export your distribution to a `.tar` archive. Replace `<DistributionName>` with the name of your distribution and `<ExportPath>` with the desired path (including filename) for the exported archive on your target drive.

    ```powershell
    wsl --export <DistributionName> <ExportPath>
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    wsl --export Ubuntu-20.04 D:\WSL\Ubuntu-20.04.tar
    ```

2.  **Unregister the WSL distribution:** Unregistering removes the distribution from WSL.

    ```powershell
    wsl --unregister <DistributionName>
    ```

    **Warning:** This will delete all the data in your WSL distribution. Ensure you have a backup (the `.tar` archive created in the previous step) before proceeding.

3.  **Import the WSL distribution:** Import the distribution from the `.tar` archive to the new location. Replace `<DistributionName>` with the name of the distribution, `<InstallLocation>` with the desired installation path on the new drive, and `<ImportPath>` with the path to the exported `.tar` archive.

    ```powershell
    wsl --import <DistributionName> <InstallLocation> <ImportPath>
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    wsl --import Ubuntu-20.04 D:\WSL\Ubuntu-20.04 D:\WSL\Ubuntu-20.04.tar
    ```

    This command creates a new WSL instance at the specified installation location, using the data from the exported archive.

4.  **Optional: Create a User:** After importing, the default user may not be set correctly. Launch the distribution with `wsl ~`. If you are logged in as root, create a new user and set it as the default:

    ```plaintext
    adduser <username>
    usermod -aG sudo <username>
    exit
    ```

    Then, in PowerShell, set the default user for the distribution:

    ```powershell
    <InstallLocation>\ubuntu2004.exe config --default-user <username>  #Adjust filename if needed
    ```

### 5. Preventing Future Disk Space Issues

Here are some tips to prevent future disk space problems with WSL:

- **Regularly clean up your WSL environment:** Get into the habit of periodically removing unnecessary files and packages.
- **Use a smaller base distribution:** Consider using a minimal distribution like Alpine Linux if you don't need all the features of larger distributions.
- **Be mindful of the files you download:** Avoid downloading large files directly into your WSL environment unless absolutely necessary. Use shared folders to access files stored on your Windows host.
- **Consider a separate data partition:** Mount a shared folder or a separate drive as a data partition within WSL. This allows you to store large files outside of the main VHDX, preventing it from growing unnecessarily.

### Code Examples Summary:

- **Remove obsolete packages:**

  ```plaintext
  sudo apt autoremove # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo dnf autoremove # Fedora
  sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qdtq) # Arch Linux
  ```

- **Clean apt cache:**

  ```plaintext
  sudo apt clean
  sudo apt autoclean
  ```

- **Find large files:**

  ```plaintext
  du -sh /* | sort -hr | head -n 20
  ```

- **Remove file:**

  ```plaintext
  rm /path/to/large/file
  ```

- **Shutdown WSL:**

  ```powershell
  wsl --shutdown
  ```

- **Find VHDX Path:**

  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Packages\*<YourDistributionName>*\LocalState\ -Filter *.vhdx -Recurse
  ```

- **Compact VHDX with Diskpart:**

  ```powershell
  diskpart
  select vdisk file="<VHDX_PATH>"
  attach vdisk readonly
  compact vdisk
  detach vdisk
  exit
  ```

- **Optimize VHDX with wsl command:**

  ```powershell
  wsl --optimize-vhd <VHDX_PATH>
  ```

- **Export WSL Distribution:**

  ```powershell
  wsl --export <DistributionName> <ExportPath>
  ```

- **Unregister WSL Distribution:**

  ```powershell
  wsl --unregister <DistributionName>
  ```

- **Import WSL Distribution:**
  ```powershell
  wsl --import <DistributionName> <InstallLocation> <ImportPath>
  ```
