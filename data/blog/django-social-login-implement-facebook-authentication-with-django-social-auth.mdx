# Django Social Login: Implement Facebook Authentication with Django Social Auth

Social login, the ability to sign in using existing accounts from platforms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter, is a popular and convenient feature for web applications. It simplifies the registration process and enhances user experience. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to implement Facebook social login in your Django project using the `django-allauth` library.

## Why Use `django-allauth`?

`django-allauth` is a powerful and versatile Django package that simplifies the implementation of social authentication, registration, account management, and password recovery. It handles much of the complexity involved in OAuth flows and provides a clean and customizable API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python:** Python 3.6 or higher is recommended.
- **Django:** Django 3.0 or higher is recommended.
- **pip:** Python package installer.
- **A Facebook Developer Account:** You'll need a Facebook Developer account to create an App and obtain the necessary credentials.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Create a Django Project (If You Don't Have One)

If you haven't already, create a new Django project:

```plaintext
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

pip install django
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp accounts # Create a new app to handle accounts and login logic
```

Remember to replace `myproject` with your desired project name and `accounts` with your preferred app name.

### 2. Install `django-allauth`

Install `django-allauth` and its dependencies:

```plaintext
pip install django-allauth
pip install python-decouple # For managing settings safely
pip install Pillow # Required by allauth for image support
```

### 3. Configure Settings

Modify your `settings.py` file (located in your project directory) to include the following settings:

```plaintext
# myproject/settings.py

import os
from decouple import config

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

# ... other settings ...

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps ...
    'django.contrib.sites', # Required by allauth
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    'allauth.socialaccount.providers.facebook',
    'accounts', # Your accounts app
]

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
]

SITE_ID = 1

LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'  # Redirect after successful login
ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/' # Redirect after logout
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True # Make email required
ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = True
ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = "email" # Login using email
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = "mandatory"  # Mandatory email verification

SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
    'facebook': {
        'APP': {
            'client_id': config('FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID'),  # Replace with your App ID
            'secret': config('FACEBOOK_SECRET_KEY'),  # Replace with your App Secret
            'key': ''
        },
        'SCOPE': ['email', 'public_profile', 'user_friends'], # Permissions you want to request
        'AUTH_PARAMS': {'auth_type': 'reauthenticate'},
        'INIT_PARAMS': {'cookie': True},
        'FIELDS': [
            'id',
            'email',
            'name',
            'first_name',
            'last_name',
            'verified',
            'locale',
            'timezone',
            'link',
            'gender',
            'updated_time',
        ],
        'EXCHANGE_TOKEN': True,
        'LOCALE_FUNC': lambda request: 'en_US',  # Or your preferred locale
        'VERIFIED_EMAIL': False,
        'VERSION': 'v18.0',
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`INSTALLED_APPS`:** Includes the necessary `django-allauth` apps and your `accounts` app. `django.contrib.sites` is crucial.
- **`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`:** Specifies the authentication backends, allowing Django to use `allauth` for authentication.
- **`SITE_ID`:** Sets the ID of the current site. Django requires this for site-related functionality. You'll need to add a site object to your database with `id=1`.
- **`LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` and `ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`:** Define where users are redirected after logging in and out.
- **`ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED` , `ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED`, `ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD`, `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`:** Configure account settings like requiring email, the authentication method (email in this case), and email verification policies.
- **`SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`:** Configures the specific social providers (in this case, Facebook). It includes:
  - `APP`: Contains your Facebook App ID and Secret Key. **Crucially, use `python-decouple` to store these securely in a `.env` file and prevent them from being committed to your repository!**
  - `SCOPE`: Specifies the permissions you need from the user's Facebook account. `email`, `public_profile` are common. `user_friends` requires Facebook App Review if you intend to go live.
  - `FIELDS`: Specifies the Facebook user data fields you want to retrieve. Keep this minimal for privacy reasons.

**Create a `.env` file:**

Create a file named `.env` in your project root directory and add the following:

```
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID
FACEBOOK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET
```

Replace `YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` with your actual Facebook App credentials.

**Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file:**

Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your sensitive credentials to your repository.

### 4. Configure URLs

Include `allauth`'s URLs in your project's `urls.py` file:

```plaintext
# myproject/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
    path('', include('accounts.urls', namespace='accounts')), # Include the accounts app's URLs
]
```

Create an `urls.py` file in your `accounts` app:

```plaintext
# accounts/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'accounts'

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'), # A simple home view
]
```

### 5. Create a Facebook App

1.  Go to the [Facebook Developers website](https://developers.facebook.com/).
2.  Create a new app. Choose the "Consumer" app type.
3.  Provide a display name and contact email.
4.  In the app dashboard, go to "Settings" -> "Basic".
5.  Fill in the required information, including your app domain and website URL. **Important:** `App Domains` must match the domain where your Django app is deployed. If you are testing locally, use `localhost`. If you are using a service like ngrok, use the ngrok domain.
6.  Add a Platform and choose "Website".
7.  Enter your site URL. **Important:** This URL must match the domain and port where your Django application is running. For local development, this is usually `http://localhost:8000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. **Don't forget the trailing slash!**
8.  Get your App ID and App Secret from the "Settings" -> "Basic" page. Store these in your `.env` file.
9.  Go to "Facebook Login" -> "Settings".
10. Under "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs," enter the callback URL: `http://localhost:8000/accounts/facebook/login/callback/` (replace `localhost:8000` with your domain and port). **Again, the trailing slash is essential!** This URL tells Facebook where to redirect the user after they have authenticated.
11. Ensure that your app is **not** in development mode. If it is, make it live (this may require Facebook app review depending on the permissions you request).

### 6. Create a Simple Home View

Create a simple home view in your `accounts/views.py` to demonstrate the login functionality.

```plaintext
# accounts/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def home(request):
    return render(request, 'accounts/home.html')
```

Create the template `accounts/templates/accounts/home.html`:

```plaintext
<!-- accounts/templates/accounts/home.html -->

{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}
<h1>Welcome, {{ user.username }}!</h1>
<p>You are logged in.</p>
<a href="{% url 'account_logout' %}">Logout</a>
{% endblock %}
```

Create a `base.html` file in `accounts/templates/`:

```plaintext
<!-- accounts/templates/base.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Django Social Login</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>
```

### 7. Add Login Template

Create a template with the Facebook login button (e.g., in your project's `templates` directory or within the `accounts` app):

```plaintext
<!-- accounts/templates/accounts/login.html -->
{% extends "base.html" %} {% load socialaccount %} {% block content %}
<h1>Login</h1>

<a href="{% provider_login_url 'facebook' process='login' %}">Login with Facebook</a>

{% endblock %}
```

Update the `accounts/views.py` to render the login page if the user isn't authenticated:

```plaintext
# accounts/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

def home(request):
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        return render(request, 'accounts/home.html')
    else:
        return render(request, 'accounts/login.html')
```

### 8. Migrate the Database

Run the database migrations:

```plaintext
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser # Create an admin user if you don't have one
```

Then, using the Django admin interface, navigate to `/admin/sites/site/` and create a Site object with `id=1` and your domain name (e.g., `localhost:8000` or `127.0.0.1:8000`).

### 9. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```plaintext
python manage.py runserver
```

### 10. Test the Facebook Login

1.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` (or your development server URL).
2.  You should see the "Login with Facebook" button.
3.  Click the button, and you'll be redirected to Facebook for authentication.
4.  After authenticating, you'll be redirected back to your Django application, and you should be logged in. You should be redirected to the `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` defined in your `settings.py` file.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid App ID:** Double-check that your Facebook App ID is correct in the `.env` file.
- **Invalid Client Secret:** Verify that your Facebook App Secret is correct in the `.env` file.
- **Invalid Redirect URI:** Make sure the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" in your Facebook App settings matches the URL you're using in your Django application (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/accounts/facebook/login/callback/`). **The trailing slash is critical!**
- **App Not Live:** Ensure that your Facebook app is not in development mode (unless you are using test users).
- **Permissions Issues:** If you're requesting permissions beyond `email` and `public_profile`, you may need to submit your app for Facebook App Review.
- **`Site` object not found:** Ensure you've created a `Site` object in the Django admin with `id=1` and your domain.
- **CSRF verification failed:** This can happen if the `CsrfViewMiddleware` is not enabled or configured properly, or if there's a mismatch between the CSRF token in the template and the one in the request. Ensure your templates are properly using `{% csrf_token %}`. While `django-allauth` handles CSRF tokens internally, it's still good practice to include it.
- **` ImproperlyConfigured: The TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting must contain 'django.template.context_processors.request'. Add it if you haven't already.`:** Add `'django.template.context_processors.request'` to `TEMPLATES` -> `OPTIONS` -> `context_processors` in your `settings.py`.

## Customization

`django-allauth` provides various options for customization:

- **Custom Templates:** Override the default templates to match your application's design.
- **Signals:** Use signals to perform custom actions during different events, such as user registration or login.
- **Settings:** Adjust the settings in `settings.py` to configure `django-allauth` to your specific needs.

## Conclusion

This guide demonstrated how to implement Facebook social login in your Django project using `django-allauth`. By following these steps, you can quickly add social authentication to your application, improving user experience and simplifying the registration process. Remember to handle your Facebook App credentials securely and to carefully configure your app settings to ensure a smooth integration.
