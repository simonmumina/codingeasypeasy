# Deploying Pyramid Web Applications with Terraform: Infrastructure as Code Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of deploying Pyramid web applications using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. By leveraging Terraform, you can automate the provisioning and management of your infrastructure, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and scalability. This guide focuses on deploying to AWS, but the principles can be adapted to other cloud providers.

## Why Use Terraform with Pyramid?

Traditionally, deploying web applications involved manual server configuration and deployment processes. This approach is error-prone, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. Terraform addresses these challenges by:

- **Automating Infrastructure Provisioning:** Define your entire infrastructure in code, automating the creation of virtual machines, networks, load balancers, and other resources.
- **Ensuring Consistency:** Terraform guarantees consistent infrastructure deployments across different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Enabling Version Control:** Store your infrastructure code in a version control system (e.g., Git), allowing you to track changes, revert to previous configurations, and collaborate effectively.
- **Improving Scalability:** Easily scale your infrastructure up or down as needed by modifying your Terraform configuration and applying the changes.
- **Reducing Errors:** Automating deployments reduces the risk of human error.
- **Cost Optimization:** IaC enables efficient resource management, reducing costs by only provisioning what you need.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **An AWS Account:** You'll need an AWS account to deploy your infrastructure.
- **Terraform Installed:** Download and install Terraform from the official website: [https://www.terraform.io/downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- **AWS CLI Installed and Configured:** The AWS CLI allows Terraform to interact with your AWS account. Install and configure it following the AWS documentation: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
- **A Pyramid Web Application:** Have a Pyramid web application ready for deployment. We'll assume you have a basic application structure. If you don't, you can create a simple one using the Pyramid quick tutorial.
- **Python 3.6 or Higher:** Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Terraform Project

1.  **Create a Project Directory:** Create a new directory for your Terraform project (e.g., `pyramid-terraform`).

    ```plaintext
    mkdir pyramid-terraform
    cd pyramid-terraform
    ```

2.  **Create a `main.tf` file:** This file will contain the core Terraform configuration.

    ```plaintext
    touch main.tf
    ```

## Step 2: Configuring the AWS Provider

Add the AWS provider configuration to your `main.tf` file. This tells Terraform how to connect to your AWS account.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 0.14.9"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with your desired AWS region
}
```

- **`required_providers`:** Specifies the AWS provider and its version.
- **`provider "aws"`:** Configures the AWS provider with your desired region. **Important:** Choose a region that is close to your users or your other services.

## Step 3: Defining the Infrastructure Resources

Now, let's define the infrastructure resources required for your Pyramid application. This will include:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** A private network for your resources.
- **Subnets:** Divisions within the VPC for isolating resources.
- **Security Groups:** Firewall rules that control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **EC2 Instance:** A virtual machine where your Pyramid application will run.
- **Internet Gateway:** Allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
- **Route Table:** Defines how traffic is routed within your VPC.

Add the following resources to your `main.tf` file:

```terraform
# VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "pyramid-vpc"
  }
}

# Internet Gateway
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = {
    Name = "pyramid-igw"
  }
}

# Public Subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a" # Replace with your desired Availability Zone
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true #important for accessing the instance from the outside world

  tags = {
    Name = "pyramid-public-subnet"
  }
}

# Route Table
resource "aws_route_table" "public" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.gw.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "pyramid-public-route-table"
  }
}

# Route Table Association
resource "aws_route_table_association" "public" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public.id
}


# Security Group
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name        = "pyramid-sg"
  description = "Allow inbound traffic on port 80, 443, and 22"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow HTTP from anywhere
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow HTTPS from anywhere
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] #Allow SSH from anywhere - LIMIT THIS TO YOUR IP IN PRODUCTION
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow all outbound traffic
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "pyramid-security-group"
  }
}


# EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami                    = "ami-0c55b61c8983a891e" # Replace with the correct AMI ID for your region (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"              # Choose an appropriate instance type
  subnet_id              = aws_subnet.public.id
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
  key_name               = "your-ssh-key"          # Replace with your SSH key name

  user_data = <<-EOF

  }
}

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
  description = "The public IP address of the Pyramid web server."
}
```

- **`ami`:** The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID. Choose an appropriate AMI for your region and operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). You can find AMI IDs in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI. It's crucial to use a secure, up-to-date AMI.
- **`instance_type`:** The EC2 instance type. `t2.micro` is a good starting point for testing, but you'll need a larger instance type for production environments.
- **`key_name`:** The name of your SSH key pair. This allows you to SSH into the EC2 instance. **Important:** Ensure your private key is securely stored.
- **`user_data`:** A script that runs when the EC2 instance is launched. This script automates the installation of required software, deployment of your Pyramid application, and configuration of Nginx as a reverse proxy. **Important:** Customize this script to match your application's specific requirements. Consider using a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) for more complex deployments. Specifically:
  - `apt update` and `apt install` update the package lists and install `python3-pip`, `nginx`, and `gunicorn`.
  - `pip3 install` installs `pyramid` and `waitress`, or any other required packages. You may want to use `gunicorn` for production deployments, but `waitress` is a pure python WSGI server.
  - The `git clone` command clones your Pyramid application from GitHub. **Replace the placeholder URL with your actual repository URL.**
  - The script creates a Supervisor configuration file (`/etc/supervisor/conf.d/pyramid-app.conf`) to manage the Gunicorn process. Supervisor ensures that Gunicorn is always running and restarts it if it crashes. **Customize the `command` and `directory` to match your application's structure.** Use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
  - The Nginx configuration configures Nginx as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the Gunicorn server running on port 8000. **Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain name.**
  - The script restarts Nginx to apply the new configuration.
- **`output "public_ip"`:** This outputs the public IP address of the EC2 instance after it's created, making it easy to access your application.

**Important Security Notes:**

- **SSH Access:** Restricting SSH access (port 22) to specific IP addresses or using SSH key rotation is vital for security. Never leave SSH open to the world in a production environment.
- **Security Groups:** Regularly review and refine your security group rules to minimize the attack surface.
- **IAM Roles:** For more secure deployments, avoid embedding AWS credentials directly in your Terraform code. Instead, use IAM roles to grant your EC2 instance the necessary permissions to access other AWS services.

## Step 4: Initializing and Applying the Configuration

1.  **Initialize Terraform:** Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project:

    ```plaintext
    terraform init
    ```

    This downloads the necessary provider plugins and prepares the project for deployment.

2.  **Format and Validate Terraform:**

    ```plaintext
    terraform fmt
    terraform validate
    ```

    These commands ensure your Terraform code is properly formatted and syntactically correct.

3.  **Plan the Deployment:**

    ```plaintext
    terraform plan
    ```

    This command creates an execution plan that shows the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure. Review the plan carefully before applying it.

4.  **Apply the Configuration:**

    ```plaintext
    terraform apply
    ```

    This command applies the configuration and creates the infrastructure resources in your AWS account. You will be prompted to confirm the changes. Type `yes` to proceed.

    Terraform will now create the VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instance, and other resources. This process may take a few minutes.

## Step 5: Accessing Your Pyramid Application

After Terraform has finished applying the configuration, it will output the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

1.  **Retrieve the Public IP:** Copy the public IP address from the Terraform output.

2.  **Access Your Application:** Open a web browser and navigate to the public IP address (e.g., `http://your-public-ip`). If you configured Nginx with a domain name, use that instead.

    If everything is configured correctly, you should see your Pyramid web application.

## Step 6: Deploying Updates

To deploy updates to your Pyramid application, follow these steps:

1.  **Make Changes to Your Application:** Modify your application code as needed.

2.  **Push Changes to Git:** Commit and push your changes to your Git repository.

3.  **SSH into the EC2 Instance:** Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance using the public IP address and your SSH key.

    ```plaintext
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-ssh-key.pem ubuntu@your-public-ip
    ```

4.  **Pull the Latest Changes:** Navigate to your application directory and pull the latest changes from your Git repository.

    ```plaintext
    cd /home/ubuntu/pyramid-app
    git pull origin main
    ```

5.  **Restart Gunicorn (or Supervisor):**

    ```plaintext
    sudo supervisorctl restart pyramid-app
    ```

    This will restart your Pyramid application with the latest changes. If you are not using Supervisor, you'll need to find and kill the Gunicorn process, and then start it again.

## Step 7: Destroying the Infrastructure

When you're finished with your infrastructure, you can destroy it using the following command:

```plaintext
terraform destroy
```

This will remove all the resources created by Terraform in your AWS account. You will be prompted to confirm the destruction. Type `yes` to proceed.

**Important:** Always destroy your infrastructure when you're no longer using it to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.

## Beyond the Basics

This guide provides a basic introduction to deploying Pyramid applications with Terraform. Here are some advanced concepts to explore:

- **Terraform Modules:** Organize your Terraform code into reusable modules for better maintainability and reusability.
- **Variables:** Use variables to make your Terraform configurations more flexible and customizable.
- **Data Sources:** Use data sources to retrieve information from AWS or other providers.
- **Remote State:** Store your Terraform state remotely (e.g., in AWS S3) for collaboration and version control.
- **Configuration Management (Ansible, Chef, Puppet):** Use configuration management tools to automate the configuration of your servers and applications. This provides more robust and scalable application deployments.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Integrate Terraform into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
- **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances for improved scalability and availability.
- **Databases:** Configure a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for your Pyramid application. Consider using managed database services like AWS RDS for ease of management.
- **HTTPS:** Configure HTTPS for secure communication with your application.

## Conclusion

Using Terraform with Pyramid allows you to automate the provisioning and management of your infrastructure, resulting in more efficient, consistent, and scalable deployments. This guide provides a solid foundation for building and deploying Pyramid applications using Infrastructure as Code. By understanding the principles and concepts outlined here, you can create robust and reliable web applications that are easy to manage and scale.
