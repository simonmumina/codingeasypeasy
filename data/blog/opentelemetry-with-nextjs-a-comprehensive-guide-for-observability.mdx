# OpenTelemetry with Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide for Observability

In today's complex microservice architectures, observability is crucial. Understanding how your application is performing, diagnosing issues, and ensuring a smooth user experience are paramount. This is where OpenTelemetry (OTel) comes in. OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework providing a standardized way to collect telemetry data (traces, metrics, and logs) from your applications. This data can then be exported to various backends for analysis and visualization.

This blog post will guide you through integrating OpenTelemetry into your Next.js application. We'll cover tracing, metrics, and logging, providing practical examples and best practices to help you gain deep insights into your application's behavior.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral, open-source observability framework that provides a set of APIs, SDKs, and tools to collect, process, and export telemetry data. Key benefits of using OpenTelemetry include:

- **Standardization:** Provides a standardized way to instrument your applications, regardless of the underlying technology stack.
- **Vendor Neutrality:** Allows you to switch between different observability backends without changing your instrumentation code.
- **Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of telemetry data types, including traces, metrics, and logs.
- **Open Source:** Backed by a vibrant community and actively maintained.

## Why Use OpenTelemetry with Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. Integrating OpenTelemetry with your Next.js application offers several advantages:

- **End-to-End Tracing:** Trace requests as they flow through your Next.js application, including client-side, server-side rendering (SSR), API routes, and data fetching.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track key metrics like request latency, error rates, and resource utilization to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Debugging Made Easier:** Correlate traces, metrics, and logs to quickly diagnose and resolve issues.
- **Improved User Experience:** Optimize your application's performance based on real-world usage patterns.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js (v16 or higher):** Next.js requires Node.js version 16 or higher.
- **npm or yarn:** Package manager for installing dependencies.
- **A Next.js project:** You can either use an existing project or create a new one using `npx create-next-app`.
- **An observability backend (optional):** While not required for initial setup, you'll need an observability backend like Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, Honeycomb, or New Relic to visualize and analyze your telemetry data. For this guide, we'll often use Jaeger as an example. Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system. You can run Jaeger locally using Docker:

  ```plaintext
  docker run -d --name jaeger \
    -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
    -p 16686:16686 \
    -p 14268:14268 \
    -p 9411:9411 \
    jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
  ```

## Setting up OpenTelemetry in Your Next.js Application

Here's a step-by-step guide to integrating OpenTelemetry into your Next.js application:

**1. Install Dependencies:**

First, install the necessary OpenTelemetry packages using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install @opentelemetry/sdk @opentelemetry/node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node @opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions
```

or using yarn:

```plaintext
yarn add @opentelemetry/sdk @opentelemetry/node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node @opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions
```

Let's break down these packages:

- `@opentelemetry/sdk`: The OpenTelemetry SDK provides the core functionality for collecting and processing telemetry data.
- `@opentelemetry/node`: Provides the Node.js specific components for the OpenTelemetry SDK.
- `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`: Automatically instruments common Node.js libraries and frameworks (e.g., HTTP, Express, MySQL) without requiring manual code changes.
- `@opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger`: Exports telemetry data to Jaeger. You can replace this with an exporter for your preferred observability backend (e.g., `@opentelemetry/exporter-zipkin`, `@opentelemetry/exporter-datadog`).
- `@opentelemetry/resources`: Allows you to define metadata about your application, such as service name and version.
- `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`: Provides standardized attribute names for common telemetry data.

**2. Create an `otel.js` file:**

Create a file named `otel.js` (or any name you prefer) at the root of your Next.js project. This file will contain the OpenTelemetry initialization code.

```javascript
// otel.js
const { NodeSDK } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { JaegerExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger')
const { Resource } = require('@opentelemetry/resources')
const { SemanticResourceAttributes } = require('@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions')

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  resource: new Resource({
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: 'nextjs-otel-demo', // Replace with your service name
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_VERSION]: '1.0.0', // Replace with your service version
  }),
  traceExporter: new JaegerExporter({ endpoint: 'http://localhost:14268/api/traces' }), // Replace with your Jaeger endpoint or your exporter specific configs
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
})

sdk
  .start()
  .then(() => console.log('OpenTelemetry initialized'))
  .catch((error) => console.log('Error initializing OpenTelemetry', error))

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  sdk
    .shutdown()
    .then(() => console.log('OpenTelemetry terminated'))
    .catch((error) => console.log('Error terminating OpenTelemetry', error))
    .finally(() => process.exit(0))
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **Import necessary modules:** Imports the required OpenTelemetry modules.
- **Create a `Resource`:** Defines metadata about your service, including the service name and version. This is crucial for identifying your application in your observability backend.
- **Create a `JaegerExporter`:** Configures the Jaeger exporter to send telemetry data to your Jaeger instance. Adjust the `endpoint` if your Jaeger instance is running on a different host or port. If you're using a different backend, replace this with the corresponding exporter. For example, for OTLP you would use `OTLPTraceExporter` from `@opentelemetry/exporter-otlp-grpc` or `@opentelemetry/exporter-otlp-http`.
- **Configure `autoInstrumentations`:** Enables automatic instrumentation of common Node.js libraries. This automatically instruments HTTP requests, database queries, and other operations.
- **Create a `NodeSDK`:** Initializes the OpenTelemetry SDK with the configured resource, exporter, and instrumentations.
- **Start the SDK:** Starts the OpenTelemetry SDK, which begins collecting telemetry data.
- **Handle SIGTERM signal:** Gracefully shuts down the OpenTelemetry SDK when the application is terminated. This ensures that all telemetry data is properly exported before the application exits.

**3. Import `otel.js` in `_app.js` or `_app.tsx`:**

To ensure that OpenTelemetry is initialized when your Next.js application starts, import the `otel.js` file in your `_app.js` or `_app.tsx` file. This file is the entry point for all pages in your Next.js application.

```javascript
// pages/_app.js (or pages/_app.tsx)

import '../otel' // Import the otel.js file
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

**Important:** Make sure to import `otel.js` at the very top of the file _before_ any other imports. This ensures that OpenTelemetry is initialized before any other modules are loaded.

**4. Run Your Next.js Application:**

Now, start your Next.js application using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. As you navigate through your application, OpenTelemetry will automatically collect telemetry data.

**5. View Traces in Jaeger:**

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:16686` to access the Jaeger UI. You should see traces from your Next.js application, allowing you to analyze request flows and identify performance bottlenecks. Remember to access your Next.js app to generate some traffic first.

## Custom Instrumentation

While automatic instrumentation covers many common scenarios, you may need to add custom instrumentation to capture more specific data. OpenTelemetry provides APIs for creating spans, which represent individual units of work within a trace.

**Example: Creating a Custom Span in an API Route**

Let's say you have an API route that performs a complex calculation. You can create a custom span to track the duration of this calculation.

```javascript
// pages/api/calculate.js

import { trace, context } from '@opentelemetry/api'

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const tracer = trace.getTracer('my-app-tracer') // Get a tracer

  const span = tracer.startSpan('calculate-complex-data') // Start a new span
  try {
    // Simulate a complex calculation
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200)) // Simulate work
    const result = Math.random() * 100 // Simulate a calculation result
    span.setAttribute('result', result) // Add an attribute to the span

    res.status(200).json({ result })
  } catch (error) {
    span.recordException(error) // Record the error in the span
    span.setStatus({ code: trace.SpanStatusCode.ERROR, message: error.message }) // Set the span status to error
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message })
  } finally {
    span.end() // End the span
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Get a Tracer:** Obtains a `Tracer` instance from the OpenTelemetry API. The tracer is responsible for creating spans.
- **Start a Span:** Creates a new span with a descriptive name (`calculate-complex-data`).
- **Add Attributes:** Adds attributes to the span to provide additional context. In this case, we're adding the calculation result.
- **Record Exceptions:** If an error occurs, record the exception in the span. This helps you identify errors that occurred during the calculation.
- **Set Span Status:** Set the span status to error if an error occurs.
- **End the Span:** Ends the span, marking the completion of the unit of work. The span's duration will be recorded.

**Important Considerations for Custom Instrumentation:**

- **Span Naming:** Choose descriptive span names that accurately reflect the unit of work being performed.
- **Attribute Usage:** Use attributes to add context to your spans. This can include input parameters, output values, and other relevant data.
- **Error Handling:** Properly handle errors and record exceptions in your spans. This provides valuable information for debugging.
- **Context Propagation:** If you're calling other services, ensure that the OpenTelemetry context is propagated to those services. This allows you to correlate traces across service boundaries. `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http` usually handles this automatically for outbound http requests. If you need to propagate manually you can use `context.active()`.

## Collecting Metrics

In addition to tracing, OpenTelemetry can also collect metrics about your application's performance. Metrics provide insights into resource utilization, error rates, and other key indicators. While automatic instrumentation captures some metrics, you can also define custom metrics to track specific aspects of your application.

**Setting up Metrics Collection (Basic Example)**

Setting up metrics collection depends heavily on the exporter you are using. Many exporters require you to setup a collector that pulls and aggregates the metrics, rather than the application pushing them. Here is a _basic_ example that shows how to setup a counter metric, but it likely won't work without a metrics collector.

```javascript
// metrics.js
const { MeterProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics')
const { ConsoleMetricExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-console') // Or your desired exporter
const { Resource } = require('@opentelemetry/resources')
const { SemanticResourceAttributes } = require('@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions')

const meterProvider = new MeterProvider({
  resource: new Resource({
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: 'nextjs-otel-demo',
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_VERSION]: '1.0.0',
  }),
  exporter: new ConsoleMetricExporter(), // Replace with your metrics exporter
  interval: 60000, // Reporting interval in milliseconds
})

meterProvider.start()

const meter = meterProvider.getMeter('my-app-meter')

const requestCounter = meter.createCounter('requests.total', {
  description: 'Total number of requests',
})

export { requestCounter }

// pages/api/hello.js

import { requestCounter } from '../../metrics'

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  requestCounter.add(1) // Increment the request counter on each request

  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Create a `MeterProvider`:** Creates a `MeterProvider` to manage the collection and export of metrics.
- **Configure a Metrics Exporter:** Configures a metrics exporter. In this example, we're using `ConsoleMetricExporter`, which prints metrics to the console. For production environments, you'll want to use a more robust exporter, such as `@opentelemetry/exporter-prometheus` or `@opentelemetry/exporter-otlp-grpc`.
- **Create a `Meter`:** Creates a `Meter` instance, which is used to create and manage individual metrics.
- **Create a Counter:** Creates a `Counter` metric, which is used to track the total number of requests.
- **Increment the Counter:** Increments the counter on each request to the `/api/hello` endpoint.

**Important Considerations for Metrics Collection:**

- **Metric Types:** Choose the appropriate metric type for your data. OpenTelemetry supports various metric types, including counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries.
- **Metric Units:** Specify the unit of measurement for your metrics (e.g., milliseconds, bytes, requests).
- **Aggregation:** Configure how metrics are aggregated. This can include averaging, summing, or calculating percentiles. The aggregation method depends on the metric type and the specific insights you're trying to gain.
- **Exporter Configuration:** Properly configure your metrics exporter to send data to your observability backend. This includes specifying the endpoint, authentication credentials, and other relevant settings.

## Collecting Logs

OpenTelemetry logging offers a standardized way to capture and correlate log data with traces and metrics, providing a holistic view of your application's behavior. However, logging with OpenTelemetry is still evolving and often relies on existing logging libraries. This is particularly true for Next.js, as you might already have a logging solution in place (e.g., `console.log`, `winston`, `pino`). The goal is to bridge the gap between your existing logging and the OpenTelemetry ecosystem.

**Bridging Existing Logging with OpenTelemetry**

The most common approach is to integrate your existing logger with OpenTelemetry context. This allows you to enrich your logs with trace IDs and span IDs, making it easier to correlate logs with traces.

Here's an example using `pino` and `@opentelemetry/api`:

```javascript
// logger.js (using pino)
import pino from 'pino';
import { context, trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';

const logger = pino({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  mixin: () => {
    const span = trace.getSpan(context.active());
    if (span) {
      const spanContext = span.spanContext();
      return {
        traceId: spanContext.traceId,
        spanId: spanContext.spanId,
      };
    }
    return {};
  },
});

export default logger;

// pages/api/example.js
import logger from '../../logger';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  logger.info('Handling request to /api/example');
  try {
    // ... your API logic ...
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Success' });
    logger.info('Request to /api/example successful');
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error({ error }, 'Error handling request to /api/example');
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Integrate with Existing Logger:** We are using `pino` as our logger.
- **Add Trace and Span IDs to Logs:** The `mixin` function in the `pino` configuration automatically adds the trace ID and span ID to each log message if a span is active. This requires importing `context` and `trace` from `@opentelemetry/api`.
- **Use the Logger:** Use the configured logger in your API routes and other parts of your application.
- **Configure Your Logging Backend:** You still need to configure your preferred logging backend (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki, Splunk) to collect and analyze your logs.

**Important Considerations for Logging:**

- **Context Propagation:** Ensure that the OpenTelemetry context is propagated throughout your application. This allows you to correlate logs with traces across different parts of your application.
- **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging (e.g., JSON) to make it easier to parse and analyze your logs.
- **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, fatal) to categorize your log messages.
- **Security:** Be careful not to log sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys.

## Best Practices for OpenTelemetry in Next.js

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when integrating OpenTelemetry into your Next.js application:

- **Start Early:** Instrument your application as early as possible in the development process. This makes it easier to identify and resolve issues.
- **Use Automatic Instrumentation:** Leverage automatic instrumentation to minimize the amount of manual code you need to write.
- **Add Custom Instrumentation:** Supplement automatic instrumentation with custom instrumentation to capture more specific data.
- **Choose the Right Exporters:** Select exporters that are compatible with your preferred observability backends.
- **Configure Sampling:** Use sampling to reduce the amount of telemetry data that is collected. This can help to improve performance and reduce costs.
- **Use Semantic Conventions:** Adhere to OpenTelemetry semantic conventions to ensure consistency and interoperability.
- **Monitor Your Instrumentation:** Monitor the performance of your OpenTelemetry instrumentation to ensure that it is not negatively impacting your application.
- **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update your OpenTelemetry dependencies to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes.
