# How to Change the Default Text Editor for Git (VS Code, Sublime Text, Nano)

Git often requires you to edit text files, such as when writing commit messages, resolving merge conflicts, or performing interactive rebases. By default, Git uses a basic text editor, which might not be your preferred choice. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to change the default text editor used by Git to your favorite editor, like VS Code, Sublime Text, Nano, or others.

## Why Change the Default Git Editor?

Using your preferred editor for Git offers several advantages:

*   **Familiar Interface:** Leverage the features and shortcuts you're already comfortable with.
*   **Syntax Highlighting:**  Easier to read and understand commit messages, especially when dealing with code snippets.
*   **Advanced Features:**  Utilize features like code completion, linting, and debugging within your Git workflows (especially with IDE integration like VS Code).
*   **Productivity:**  Streamline your workflow and improve efficiency when working with Git.

## Understanding Git Configuration

Before we dive into specific editor configurations, it's important to understand how Git configuration works. Git uses three levels of configuration:

*   **System:** Applied to all users on the system.  Located in `/etc/gitconfig` (or similar, depending on your OS).  Requires administrator privileges to modify.
*   **Global:** Applied to the current user. Located in `~/.gitconfig` (or `~/.config/git/config` on some systems).
*   **Local:** Applied to the current Git repository. Located in `.git/config` within the repository's root directory.

Settings are overridden in order of increasing specificity: system < global < local.  Therefore, a local setting will always override a global or system setting.

**Recommendation:**  For general use, it's best to set the editor at the global level unless you specifically need a different editor for a particular project.

## Setting the Default Editor

The core configuration setting that controls the Git editor is `core.editor`. You can set it using the `git config` command. The general syntax is:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "<editor_command>"
```

Let's look at specific examples for different editors.

## Configuring VS Code as the Default Git Editor

Visual Studio Code is a popular and powerful code editor.

**1. Using the `code` command-line tool:**

If you have VS Code installed and the `code` command is available in your terminal (usually added during VS Code installation), you can use the following command:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

The `--wait` flag is crucial. It tells Git to wait for VS Code to close the file before continuing the Git operation.  Without it, Git might proceed before you've saved your changes in VS Code.

**2. Specifying the full path (if `code` is not in your PATH):**

If the `code` command is not recognized, you'll need to specify the full path to the VS Code executable.  This path varies depending on your operating system:

*   **Windows:**

    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe' --wait"
    ```

    **Note:**  Use single quotes to enclose the path and double quotes around `--wait`. Backslashes in Windows paths may need to be escaped (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\...`).

*   **macOS:**

    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron --wait"
    ```

*   **Linux:**  The path typically depends on how you installed VS Code (e.g., via Snap, APT, or manually). It might be something like:

    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "/usr/bin/code --wait" # Common path
    # Or if installed with snap
    git config --global core.editor "/snap/bin/code --wait"
    ```

**Important:**  Adjust the paths above to match the actual location of your VS Code executable.

## Configuring Sublime Text as the Default Git Editor

Sublime Text is another popular and lightweight code editor.

**1. Using the `subl` command-line tool:**

Similar to VS Code, Sublime Text often provides a command-line tool called `subl`.  If it's in your PATH, use:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "subl -w"
```

The `-w` flag is equivalent to `--wait` and ensures Git waits for Sublime Text to close the file.

**2. Specifying the full path (if `subl` is not in your PATH):**

*   **Windows:**

    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text/sublime_text.exe' -w"
    ```

*   **macOS:**

    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -w"
    ```

*   **Linux:**

    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "/usr/bin/subl -w" # Replace with the actual path
    ```

## Configuring Nano as the Default Git Editor

Nano is a simple, terminal-based text editor that's often pre-installed on Linux and macOS systems.

```bash
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

No special flags are usually needed for Nano. It's already a terminal application and Git will wait for it to exit.

## Configuring Vim as the Default Git Editor

Vim is a powerful, highly configurable text editor that runs in the terminal. If you are comfortable with Vim, you can set it as the default Git editor:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "vim"
```

## Verifying the Configuration

After setting the editor, you can verify the configuration by running:

```bash
git config --get core.editor
```

This command will output the currently configured editor.

## Testing the Configuration

To test if the configuration works correctly, you can try a Git operation that requires editing a file, such as writing a commit message:

1.  Create a new repository or navigate to an existing one.
2.  Make a small change to a file.
3.  Run `git commit` (without the `-m` option).  This should open your configured editor with a pre-filled commit message template.
4.  Write your commit message, save the file, and close the editor.
5.  Git should then complete the commit operation.

If the editor opens as expected and Git proceeds after you save and close the file, your configuration is successful.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Editor Doesn't Open:**
    *   Double-check the path to the editor executable.
    *   Ensure the editor is installed correctly and accessible from your terminal.
    *   Verify the `--wait` (or equivalent) flag is present.
*   **Git Doesn't Wait for Editor to Close:**
    *   The `--wait` (or equivalent) flag is missing or incorrect.  Without this flag, Git will not wait for the editor to finish, leading to incomplete commits or other issues.
*   **Error Messages:**
    *   Read the error messages carefully. They often provide clues about what went wrong (e.g., "command not found," "invalid path").

## Conclusion

Changing the default text editor for Git can significantly enhance your workflow. By using your preferred editor, you can take advantage of its features and improve your productivity. This guide has provided detailed instructions for configuring popular editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, and Nano, along with troubleshooting tips to ensure a smooth setup. Experiment and find the configuration that best suits your needs. Happy coding!
