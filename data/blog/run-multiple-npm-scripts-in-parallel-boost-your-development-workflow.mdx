# Run Multiple npm Scripts in Parallel: Boost Your Development Workflow

In modern web development, you often need to run multiple tasks simultaneously. Think of situations like:

- Running a development server for your frontend (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
- Watching for file changes and triggering rebuilds (e.g., using Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup).
- Running a backend API server (e.g., Node.js with Express).
- Executing linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) on file save.
- Running automated tests.

Manually opening multiple terminals and running each command separately is tedious and error-prone. Fortunately, npm and other tools provide ways to run multiple npm scripts in parallel, significantly improving your development workflow.

## Why Run npm Scripts in Parallel?

Parallel execution offers several advantages:

- **Improved Efficiency:** Tasks run concurrently, reducing the overall time required to complete them. This is especially noticeable when dealing with long-running processes like compiling large codebases or running extensive test suites.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** A single command can initiate multiple processes, simplifying your development workflow. You no longer need to switch between terminals or remember a series of commands.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** By automating repetitive tasks, you can focus on writing code and solving problems rather than managing your build process.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Parallel execution can provide real-time feedback from multiple processes simultaneously, making it easier to identify and address issues as they arise. For example, you can see linting errors and server output at the same time.

## Methods for Running npm Scripts in Parallel

Several approaches allow you to run npm scripts in parallel. We'll explore the most popular and effective methods.

### 1. Using `concurrently`

`concurrently` is a widely used npm package specifically designed for running multiple commands concurrently. It offers several benefits:

- **Simple Syntax:** Easy to configure and use with a clear and concise syntax.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Colored Output:** Distinguishes the output from each process with different colors, making it easier to monitor.
- **Easy Configuration:** Integrates directly with your `package.json` file.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev concurrently
# or
yarn add -D concurrently
```

**Usage:**

1.  **Modify your `package.json`:** Add a new script that uses `concurrently` to run your desired commands.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node server.js",
        "dev:frontend": "webpack serve --mode development",
        "dev:backend": "nodemon server.js",
        "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:frontend\" \"npm run dev:backend\""
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "concurrently": "^7.0.0",
        "nodemon": "^2.0.0",
        "webpack": "^5.0.0",
        "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0",
        "webpack-dev-server": "^4.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Run the new script:** Execute the `dev` script using npm.

    ```plaintext
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will run both `npm run dev:frontend` and `npm run dev:backend` in parallel. You'll see colored output from each process in the terminal.

**Example with More Scripts:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev:frontend": "webpack serve --mode development",
    "dev:backend": "nodemon server.js",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "test": "jest",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:frontend\" \"npm run dev:backend\" \"npm run lint\" \"npm run format\""
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "concurrently": "^7.0.0",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.0",
    "webpack": "^5.0.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^4.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "prettier": "^2.0.0",
    "jest": "^29.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Customizing Output and Behavior:**

`concurrently` provides various options for customizing its behavior. Some useful options include:

- `-n, --names <names>`: Customize the names displayed in the terminal for each command.

  ```json
  "dev": "concurrently -n \"Frontend,Backend,Lint,Format\" \"npm run dev:frontend\" \"npm run dev:backend\" \"npm run lint\" \"npm run format\""
  ```

- `-c, --colors <colors>`: Customize the colors used for each command's output. You can specify a comma-separated list of colors.

  ```json
  "dev": "concurrently -c \"blue,green,yellow,magenta\" \"npm run dev:frontend\" \"npm run dev:backend\" \"npm run lint\" \"npm run format\""
  ```

- `-k, --kill-others`: Kill all other processes if one process exits.

  ```json
  "dev": "concurrently -k \"npm run dev:frontend\" \"npm run dev:backend\""
  ```

Refer to the `concurrently` documentation for a complete list of available options.

### 2. Using `npm-run-all`

`npm-run-all` is another popular package for running multiple npm scripts, offering more advanced features than `concurrently`.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev npm-run-all
# or
yarn add -D npm-run-all
```

**Usage:**

1.  **Modify your `package.json`:** Use `npm-run-all` within your npm scripts.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node server.js",
        "dev:frontend": "webpack serve --mode development",
        "dev:backend": "nodemon server.js",
        "dev": "npm-run-all --parallel dev:frontend dev:backend"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "npm-run-all": "^4.0.0",
        "nodemon": "^2.0.0",
        "webpack": "^5.0.0",
        "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0",
        "webpack-dev-server": "^4.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Run the new script:**

    ```plaintext
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will run `dev:frontend` and `dev:backend` in parallel.

**Key Features of `npm-run-all`:**

- **Parallel and Sequential Execution:** `npm-run-all` supports both parallel (`--parallel` or `-p`) and sequential (`--serial` or `-s`) execution of npm scripts.

- **Globbing:** You can use glob patterns to run multiple scripts that match a specific pattern.

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:*": "webpack --config webpack.$npm_package_name.config.js",
    "build-all": "npm-run-all build:foo build:bar"  // Builds foo and bar
  }
  ```

- **More Control Over Execution Order:** Provides more granular control over the execution order and dependencies between scripts.

### 3. Using `&` (Backgrounding) and `wait` (Linux/macOS Only)\*\*

This method is specific to Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS) and leverages shell features to run commands in the background. While less portable to Windows, it can be a simple option for development in a Unix environment.

**Usage:**

1.  **Modify your `package.json`:**

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node server.js",
        "dev:frontend": "webpack serve --mode development",
        "dev:backend": "nodemon server.js",
        "dev": "npm run dev:frontend & npm run dev:backend & wait"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "nodemon": "^2.0.0",
        "webpack": "^5.0.0",
        "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0",
        "webpack-dev-server": "^4.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Run the new script:**

    ```plaintext
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

**Explanation:**

- `&`: The ampersand character (`&`) tells the shell to run the preceding command in the background. This allows multiple commands to be started without waiting for each one to finish.
- `wait`: The `wait` command causes the shell to wait for all background processes to complete before exiting the script. Without `wait`, the script might terminate before the background processes have finished.

**Limitations:**

- **Operating System Dependency:** This approach is not cross-platform and will not work on Windows.
- **Output Management:** Managing the output from background processes can be challenging, as their output might be interleaved and difficult to read. Colors are typically lost when redirecting output in this way.
- **Error Handling:** Error handling can be more complex, as you need to monitor the status of each background process individually.

### 4. Leveraging Node.js and Child Processes (Advanced)\*\*

For more complex scenarios or fine-grained control, you can use Node.js's built-in `child_process` module to spawn and manage child processes. This approach requires more coding but offers maximum flexibility.

```javascript
// script.js
const { spawn } = require('child_process')

const processes = [
  { command: 'npm', args: ['run', 'dev:frontend'] },
  { command: 'npm', args: ['run', 'dev:backend'] },
]

processes.forEach(({ command, args, options }) => {
  const child = spawn(command, args, { stdio: 'inherit', ...options })

  child.on('close', (code) => {
    if (code !== 0) {
      console.error(`Process ${command} ${args.join(' ')} exited with code ${code}`)
      process.exit(1) // Exit the main process if a child process fails
    }
  })
})

console.log('All processes started.')
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`child_process.spawn()`:** This function spawns a new process with the specified command and arguments.
2.  **`stdio: 'inherit'`:** This option configures the child process's standard input, output, and error streams to be connected to the parent process's streams. This ensures that the output from the child processes is displayed in the terminal.
3.  **Error Handling:** The `child.on('close', ...)` event listener allows you to monitor the exit code of each child process and take appropriate action, such as exiting the main process if a child process fails.

**To use this script:**

1.  Save the code as `script.js`.
2.  Modify your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev:frontend": "webpack serve --mode development",
    "dev:backend": "nodemon server.js",
    "dev": "node script.js"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.0",
    "webpack": "^5.0.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.0.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

3.  Run `npm run dev`.

**Advantages of this approach:**

- **Fine-Grained Control:** You have complete control over how the child processes are spawned and managed.
- **Customizable Error Handling:** You can implement sophisticated error handling and logging.
- **Flexibility:** You can easily adapt the code to handle complex scenarios, such as passing data between processes or dynamically starting processes based on runtime conditions.

**Disadvantages:**

- **More Code:** Requires more code than using `concurrently` or `npm-run-all`.
- **Complexity:** Can be more complex to set up and debug.

## Choosing the Right Method

The best method for running npm scripts in parallel depends on your specific needs and preferences:

- **`concurrently`:** A great starting point for simple parallel execution scenarios. Easy to use and configure.
- **`npm-run-all`:** Offers more advanced features like sequential execution and globbing, making it suitable for more complex build processes.
- **`&` and `wait` (Linux/macOS):** A quick and easy option for Unix-like environments but lacks cross-platform compatibility and advanced features.
- **Node.js and `child_process`:** Provides the most flexibility and control but requires more coding and is best suited for complex scenarios.

## Best Practices

- **Clear Script Names:** Use descriptive names for your npm scripts to improve readability and maintainability. For example, `dev:frontend`, `dev:backend`, `test:unit`, `lint:js`.
- **Avoid Overly Complex Scripts:** Keep your scripts relatively simple and focused. For complex tasks, consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable scripts.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to configure your scripts and make them more portable. For example, you can use `process.env.NODE_ENV` to conditionally load different configurations.
- **Test Your Scripts:** Test your scripts thoroughly to ensure that they are working as expected and that they handle errors gracefully.
- **Document Your Scripts:** Add comments to your `package.json` file to explain what each script does.

## Conclusion

Running npm scripts in parallel is an essential technique for improving your development workflow and boosting productivity. By using tools like `concurrently`, `npm-run-all`, or leveraging Node.js's `child_process` module, you can streamline your build process, reduce development time, and focus on creating great software.
