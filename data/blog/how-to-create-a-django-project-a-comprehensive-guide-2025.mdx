# How to Create a Django Project: A Comprehensive Guide (2025)

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of creating a new Django project, covering everything from installation to running your development server.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Django is a Python framework, so you'll need Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher. You can download the latest version from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip:** Pip is the package installer for Python. It usually comes bundled with Python installations. You can verify if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` in your terminal. If not, you may need to install it separately (refer to the official Python documentation for instructions).

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended. It isolates your project's dependencies from the global Python environment, preventing conflicts between different projects.

1.  **Navigate to your desired project directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project.

    ```plaintext
    cd /path/to/your/project/directory
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:** Use the `venv` module (included with Python 3.3 and later) to create a virtual environment.

    ```plaintext
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    This creates a directory named `venv` (or any name you choose) that contains the virtual environment.

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:** Activate the environment using the appropriate command for your operating system.

    - **Linux/macOS:**

      ```plaintext
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    - **Windows:**

      ```plaintext
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    Once activated, you'll see the name of your virtual environment in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt, e.g., `(venv)`.

## Step 2: Install Django

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install Django.

1.  **Install Django using pip:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install Django
    ```

    This command downloads and installs the latest version of Django from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

2.  **Verify the installation:** You can verify that Django is installed correctly by checking its version.

    ```plaintext
    python -m django --version
    ```

    This should output the installed Django version, e.g., `4.2.7`.

## Step 3: Create a New Django Project

Now that Django is installed, you can create a new project.

1.  **Use the `django-admin` command:** Django provides a command-line tool called `django-admin` to help you manage your projects. Use the `startproject` command to create a new project.

    ```plaintext
    django-admin startproject myproject
    ```

    Replace `myproject` with the desired name for your project. This command creates a directory named `myproject` (or whatever name you chose) containing the basic project structure.

2.  **Project Structure:** The `startproject` command generates the following directory structure:

    ```
    myproject/
        manage.py
        myproject/
            __init__.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            asgi.py
            wsgi.py
    ```

    - `manage.py`: A command-line utility for managing your Django project.
    - `myproject/`: The Python package for your project. Its name is the same as your project.
    - `myproject/__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
    - `myproject/settings.py`: Configuration settings for your Django project.
    - `myproject/urls.py`: Defines the URL patterns for your Django project.
    - `myproject/asgi.py`: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
    - `myproject/wsgi.py`: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. (Web Server Gateway Interface)

## Step 4: Migrate the Database

Django comes with built-in support for various databases. The default is SQLite, which is sufficient for development. To set up the database, you need to run migrations.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```plaintext
    cd myproject
    ```

2.  **Run migrations:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

    This command creates the initial database tables based on the settings in `settings.py`.

## Step 5: Create a Superuser (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a superuser allows you to access the Django admin interface.

1.  **Create a superuser:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    You'll be prompted to enter a username, email address, and password for the superuser.

## Step 6: Run the Development Server

Django includes a built-in development server that you can use for testing and development.

1.  **Run the development server:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    This starts the development server, usually on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

2.  **Access your project:** Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see the default Django "It worked!" page, confirming that your project is running successfully.

3.  **Access the admin interface:** To access the Django admin interface, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. Log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier.

## Step 7: Create Your First Django App

A Django _project_ is a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings. A Django _app_ is a self-contained set of code that implements a specific feature of your web application. You can have multiple apps within a single Django project.

1.  **Create an app:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py startapp myapp
    ```

    Replace `myapp` with the desired name for your app. This creates a directory named `myapp` containing the basic app structure.

2.  **App Structure:**

    ```
    myapp/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
    ```

    - `myapp/__init__.py`: Indicates that this is a Python package.
    - `myapp/admin.py`: Registers models for the Django admin interface.
    - `myapp/apps.py`: Configuration for the app.
    - `myapp/migrations/`: Contains database migration files.
    - `myapp/models.py`: Defines the data models for your app.
    - `myapp/tests.py`: Contains test cases for your app.
    - `myapp/views.py`: Defines the logic for handling HTTP requests and rendering responses.

3.  **Register your app:** You need to register your newly created app in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your project's `settings.py` file. Open `myproject/settings.py` and add your app's name to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

    ```plaintext
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'myapp',  # Add your app here
    ]
    ```

## Step 8: Define a Model (Example)

Let's define a simple model in your app. Open `myapp/models.py` and add the following code:

```plaintext
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

This creates a model named `MyModel` with three fields: `name` (a character field), `description` (a text field), and `created_at` (a date and time field that automatically stores the creation time).

## Step 9: Create and Apply Migrations

After defining your model, you need to create and apply migrations to update the database.

1.  **Create migrations:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py makemigrations myapp
    ```

    This command generates a migration file based on the changes you made to the `models.py` file.

2.  **Apply migrations:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py migrate myapp
    ```

    This command applies the migrations to the database, creating the `MyModel` table.

## Step 10: Create a View (Example)

Let's create a simple view to display a list of `MyModel` instances. Open `myapp/views.py` and add the following code:

```plaintext
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MyModel

def my_view(request):
    objects = MyModel.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'myapp/my_template.html', {'objects': objects})
```

This view retrieves all `MyModel` instances from the database and passes them to a template named `myapp/my_template.html`.

## Step 11: Create a Template (Example)

Create a directory named `templates` inside your app directory (`myapp/templates`). Inside the `templates` directory, create another directory with the same name as your app (`myapp/templates/myapp`). Finally, create a file named `my_template.html` inside `myapp/templates/myapp` and add the following code:

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Models</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Models</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for object in objects %}
      <li>{{ object.name }} - {{ object.description }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

This template iterates through the `objects` passed from the view and displays the name and description of each `MyModel` instance.

## Step 12: Define a URL Pattern

To access your view, you need to define a URL pattern. Create a file named `urls.py` inside your app directory (`myapp/urls.py`) and add the following code:

```plaintext
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('my-view/', views.my_view, name='my_view'),
]
```

This defines a URL pattern that maps the URL `/my-view/` to the `my_view` view function.

## Step 13: Include App URLs in Project URLs

Finally, you need to include the app's URL patterns in the project's `urls.py` file. Open `myproject/urls.py` and add the following code:

```plaintext
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),  # Include app URLs
]
```

This includes all the URL patterns defined in the `myapp/urls.py` file under the `/myapp/` prefix.

## Step 14: Access Your View

Now, restart the development server (if it's not already running) and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/my-view/` in your web browser. You should see the list of `MyModel` instances (if you've created any in the admin interface).
