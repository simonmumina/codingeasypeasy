# Handling CORS with Credentials in NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial security mechanism implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one which served the web page. This is essential for preventing malicious websites from accessing sensitive data from other domains. When dealing with authentication and authorization, enabling CORS with credentials becomes particularly important. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring CORS with credentials in NestJS, providing practical examples and addressing common issues.

## Understanding CORS and Credentials

Before diving into the implementation, let's clarify what CORS and credentials are:

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** A browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. A cross-origin request is one where the protocol, domain, or port differs from that of the originating page.
- **Credentials:** Information used to authenticate a user, such as cookies, authorization headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`), or client certificates. These credentials are often required for accessing protected resources.

By default, browsers do not send credentials with cross-origin requests. This is where configuring CORS with credentials comes into play. When you want your client-side application (e.g., a React frontend) to send cookies or authorization headers to your NestJS API running on a different domain, you need to explicitly configure your NestJS application to handle this.

## Why Enable CORS with Credentials?

Consider a scenario where your NestJS API handles user authentication using cookies or JWTs stored in cookies. Your frontend application, running on a different domain, needs to make authenticated requests to your API. Without proper CORS configuration with credentials, the browser will block these requests, even if the user is already authenticated.

Enabling CORS with credentials ensures that your client-side application can securely send and receive authentication information, allowing you to build robust and secure web applications.

## Configuring CORS in NestJS

NestJS provides several ways to configure CORS. We'll explore the recommended and most secure methods:

### 1. Using the `@nestjs/platform-express` Package (Recommended)

The `@nestjs/platform-express` package provides a robust and flexible way to handle CORS configuration. This is typically the preferred method, as it integrates seamlessly with Express.js (the underlying framework for NestJS).

**Installation:**

If you haven't already, install the `@nestjs/platform-express` package:

```plaintext
npm install @nestjs/platform-express
```

**Configuration:**

Here's how to configure CORS using the `enableCors` method within your NestJS application's `main.ts` file:

```plaintext
// src/main.ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)

  app.enableCors({
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000', // Replace with your frontend's origin
    credentials: true, // Allow sending of cookies
  })

  await app.listen(3001)
}
bootstrap()
```

**Explanation:**

- **`app.enableCors()`:** This method enables CORS for your entire application.
- **`origin: 'http://localhost:3000'`:** Specifies the origin(s) that are allowed to make cross-origin requests. **Important:** In a production environment, you should replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with the actual domain(s) of your frontend application(s). For multiple origins, you can provide an array: `origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://another-domain.com']`. For dynamic configuration (e.g., reading from environment variables), you can use a function as the value for `origin` as shown below.
- **`credentials: true`:** This is the crucial part! It tells the browser to include credentials (cookies, authorization headers) in the cross-origin requests. Without this, the browser will block the sending of credentials, and your authentication mechanism will fail.

**Dynamic Origin Configuration (Environment Variables):**

For production environments, you'll likely want to configure the allowed origins using environment variables. Here's an example:

```plaintext
// src/main.ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)

  const allowedOrigins = process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS
    ? process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(',')
    : ['http://localhost:3000']

  app.enableCors({
    origin: allowedOrigins,
    credentials: true,
  })

  await app.listen(3001)
}
bootstrap()
```

Make sure to set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of allowed domains (e.g., `http://localhost:3000,https://my-app.com`).

**Important Security Considerations:**

- **Avoid Wildcard Origins (`origin: '*'`) in Production:** Using `origin: '*'` allows any origin to make requests to your API, which is a significant security risk. Only use it for development purposes or when you have a very specific reason and understand the implications.
- **Explicitly Define Allowed Origins:** Always specify the exact origins that are allowed to make requests to your API.
- **HTTPS is Essential:** When dealing with credentials, using HTTPS is crucial to protect sensitive data during transmission. Ensure both your frontend and backend are served over HTTPS.

### 2. Using the `@nestjs/cors` Package

The `@nestjs/cors` package is a dedicated NestJS module for handling CORS. It offers a more declarative approach.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
npm install @nestjs/cors
```

**Configuration:**

```plaintext
// src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { CorsModule } from '@nestjs/cors'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'

@Module({
  imports: [
    CorsModule.forRoot({
      origin: 'http://localhost:3000', // Replace with your frontend's origin
      credentials: true, // Allow sending of cookies
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`CorsModule.forRoot()`:** This configures CORS globally for your application.
- The `origin` and `credentials` options work the same way as in the `enableCors` example.

**Benefits of `@nestjs/cors`:**

- **Centralized Configuration:** Keeps your CORS configuration in one place (the `AppModule`).
- **Declarative Approach:** More readable and easier to understand.

### 3. Middleware Approach (Less Common, More Control)

You can also implement CORS using custom middleware. This provides the most granular control over the CORS headers. However, it's generally more complex than the previous methods.

```plaintext
// src/middleware/cors.middleware.ts
import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common'
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'

@Injectable()
export class CorsMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000') // Replace with your frontend's origin
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE')
    res.header(
      'Access-Control-Allow-Headers',
      'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'
    )
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true') // Allow sending of cookies
    next()
  }
}

// src/app.module.ts
import { Module, NestModule, MiddlewareConsumer } from '@nestjs/common'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'
import { CorsMiddleware } from './middleware/cors.middleware'

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule implements NestModule {
  configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    consumer.apply(CorsMiddleware).forRoutes('*') // Apply to all routes
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`CorsMiddleware`:** This middleware sets the CORS headers for each request.
- **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:** Specifies the allowed origin.
- **`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`:** Specifies the allowed HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`:** Specifies the allowed request headers.
- **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`:** Crucially, this header enables the browser to include credentials in the request.
- **`MiddlewareConsumer`:** This configures the middleware to be applied to all routes (`forRoutes('*')`).

**When to Use Middleware:**

- **Fine-grained Control:** If you need to customize the CORS headers based on specific routes or request parameters.
- **Complex Scenarios:** When you have very specific CORS requirements that are not easily handled by the other methods.

## Client-Side (Frontend) Configuration

Even after configuring CORS on your NestJS backend, you also need to configure your frontend application to handle credentials correctly. This usually involves setting the `withCredentials` flag to `true` when making requests using `fetch` or `axios`.

**Example using `fetch`:**

```plaintext
// Example using fetch
fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/data', {
  // Replace with your API endpoint
  method: 'GET',
  credentials: 'include', // Or 'same-origin' depending on your needs
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
```

**Example using `axios`:**

```plaintext
// Example using axios
import axios from 'axios'

axios.defaults.withCredentials = true // Set globally, or per request

axios
  .get('http://localhost:3001/api/data') // Replace with your API endpoint
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data)
  })
```

**Explanation:**

- **`credentials: 'include'` (fetch) or `withCredentials = true` (axios):** This tells the browser to include credentials (cookies, authorization headers) in the request. `'include'` means send credentials in all cases. `'same-origin'` means send credentials only for same-origin requests.

## Troubleshooting CORS Issues

CORS issues can be frustrating to debug. Here are some common problems and solutions:

- **"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource":**
  - **Cause:** The server is not sending the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
  - **Solution:** Ensure you have configured CORS correctly on your NestJS backend. Double-check the `origin` value.
- **"The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must not be the wildcard '\*' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'":**
  - **Cause:** You are using `origin: '*'` in your NestJS CORS configuration, but the client is sending credentials (e.g., `withCredentials: true`).
  - **Solution:** Replace `origin: '*'` with the specific origin(s) of your frontend application(s).
- **"Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: Request header field authorization is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response":**
  - **Cause:** The server is not allowing the `Authorization` header (or other custom headers) in the preflight (OPTIONS) request.
  - **Solution:** Ensure that the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header in your NestJS CORS configuration includes all custom headers that your client is sending (e.g., `'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization'`). Also check your `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` to ensure that `OPTIONS` is included.
- **Cookies are not being sent/received:**
  - **Cause:** Several potential issues:
    - `credentials: true` is not set on the server-side (NestJS).
    - `withCredentials = true` or `credentials: 'include'` is not set on the client-side.
    - The `domain` and `path` attributes of the cookie are not correctly set (if you are using cookies for authentication). The cookie `domain` must be a domain the client can access. For development with `localhost`, the `domain` attribute of a cookie is usually omitted.
    - The secure attribute of the cookie may need to be set to `true` if your site is using HTTPS.

## Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS in production, especially when dealing with credentials.
- **Be Specific with Origins:** Avoid wildcard origins (`origin: '*'`) and explicitly define the allowed origins.
- **Validate Allowed Origins:** Consider validating allowed origins against a list of trusted domains. This helps prevent against typos and unauthorized access.
- **Secure Your Cookies:** When using cookies for authentication, set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags to enhance security. The `HttpOnly` flag prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, and the `Secure` flag ensures that the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS. Use `SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax` to prevent CSRF attacks where applicable.
- **Regularly Review CORS Configuration:** Review your CORS configuration periodically to ensure it aligns with your security requirements and application architecture.

## Conclusion

Handling CORS with credentials is essential for building secure and robust web applications with NestJS. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively configure CORS in your NestJS application and enable secure communication with your frontend, ensuring the integrity and security of your data. Remember to always prioritize security and be mindful of the potential risks associated with overly permissive CORS configurations. Choose the CORS configuration method that best suits your application's needs, and always test thoroughly to ensure everything is working as expected.
