# How to Run Commands on Multiple PCs Simultaneously Using CMD (Windows)

As system administrators, IT professionals, or even power users managing multiple Windows PCs, the need to execute commands on several machines simultaneously is a common one. This article explores different techniques to achieve this, ranging from built-in Windows utilities to scripting solutions, allowing you to automate tasks and save valuable time. We'll cover the pros and cons of each approach and provide detailed code examples to get you started.

## Why Run Commands on Multiple PCs at Once?

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand why you might want to do this in the first place:

- **Software Updates and Patching:** Deploying updates and security patches to all machines in your network becomes significantly faster.
- **Configuration Changes:** Apply consistent settings across all computers, ensuring uniformity and compliance.
- **Troubleshooting and Diagnostics:** Remotely diagnose issues and collect system information from multiple machines in parallel.
- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks, such as starting or stopping services, copying files, or running scripts.
- **Inventory Management:** Collect hardware and software inventory data from all PCs for asset tracking and management.

## Methods for Running Commands on Multiple PCs

We'll explore several methods, each with its strengths and weaknesses:

1.  **PsExec (From Sysinternals):** A powerful and widely used tool for remote command execution.
2.  **PowerShell Remoting:** Leveraging PowerShell's remoting capabilities for robust and secure remote management.
3.  **Batch Scripting with Parallel Execution (Custom Solution):** Creating your own batch script to execute commands concurrently using `start` command.
4.  **Task Scheduler on Remote Machines (Less Recommended):** Scheduling tasks remotely via CMD (This is not the primary focus, but mentioned for completeness)

## 1. Using PsExec

PsExec, part of the Sysinternals Suite (now Microsoft), is a lightweight tool that allows you to execute processes on other systems. It handles the authentication and command execution details transparently.

**Prerequisites:**

- Download PsExec from the official Microsoft website: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)
- Place `PsExec.exe` in a directory accessible to your PATH environment variable (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32`).
- Ensure file and printer sharing is enabled on the target machines.
- The user running PsExec needs administrative privileges on the remote computers.
- (Optional) Disable User Account Control (UAC) or configure it for remote management.

**How to Use PsExec:**

The basic syntax is:

```
psexec \\<computername> -u <username> -p <password> <command>
```

- `\\<computername>`: The name or IP address of the remote computer.
- `-u <username>`: The username to use for authentication on the remote machine. If omitted, it uses your current user account. Crucially, the account needs to have _administrator_ privileges on the remote machine.
- `-p <password>`: The password for the specified username. If omitted and the username is different from your current user, PsExec will prompt for a password. _Avoid storing passwords in scripts whenever possible_.
- `<command>`: The command you want to execute on the remote machine.

**Example 1: Getting the OS Version on a Single Remote Machine**

```plaintext
psexec \\PC01 cmd /c ver
```

This command will execute the `ver` command (which displays the Windows version) on the computer named `PC01`. If you're running this under an account that's already an administrator on `PC01`, you might not need `-u` and `-p`.

**Example 2: Running a Command on Multiple Machines Listed in a Text File**

Create a text file named `computers.txt` with a list of computer names, one per line:

```
PC01
PC02
PC03
```

Then, use the following command to run the `hostname` command on all machines in the list:

```plaintext
for /f "tokens=*" %%a in (computers.txt) do psexec \\%%a cmd /c hostname
```

**Example 3: Running a Batch File on Multiple Machines**

Create a batch file named `update.bat` (e.g., to update software):

```plaintext
@echo off
echo Starting update...
REM Add your update commands here, e.g.:
wmic qfe list brief /format:csv > C:\temp\hotfixes.csv
echo Update complete.
```

Then, use PsExec to run the batch file on multiple machines:

```plaintext
for /f "tokens=*" %%a in (computers.txt) do psexec \\%%a -c update.bat
```

The `-c` option copies the `update.bat` file to the remote machine, executes it, and then deletes it.

**Pros of PsExec:**

- Easy to use and deploy.
- Doesn't require installing software on the remote machines (besides PsExec itself needing to be in the path).
- Relatively lightweight.

**Cons of PsExec:**

- Requires administrative privileges on the remote machines.
- Can be blocked by firewalls or security software.
- Less secure than PowerShell remoting (plaintext credentials if not using current user).
- Output is not always easily captured and redirected.

## 2. Using PowerShell Remoting

PowerShell Remoting provides a more secure and robust way to execute commands on remote machines. It leverages WinRM (Windows Remote Management) for secure communication.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Enable PowerShell Remoting:** On each target machine, run the following command in an _elevated_ PowerShell console:

  ```powershell
  Enable-PSRemoting -Force
  ```

  This command configures WinRM and creates the necessary firewall rules. You only need to do this _once_ per machine.

- **Configuration Trust:** By default, you might need to add the remote machines to your trusted hosts list. You can do this with:

  ```powershell
  Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "*" -Force
  ```

  **Warning:** Setting the TrustedHosts to `"*"` is generally _not recommended_ for production environments due to security concerns. Instead, specify the FQDNs of the specific computers you want to manage. For example:

  ```powershell
  Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "PC01.example.com,PC02.example.com" -Force
  ```

- **User Permissions:** The user account running the remote commands needs to be a member of the `Remote Management Users` group on the target machines (or have equivalent privileges). Members of the Administrators group automatically have these privileges.

**How to Use PowerShell Remoting:**

PowerShell provides several cmdlets for remoting:

- `Invoke-Command`: Executes commands on remote computers.
- `Enter-PSSession`: Creates an interactive PowerShell session on a remote computer.
- `New-PSSession`: Creates a persistent connection to a remote computer.

**Example 1: Getting the OS Version on a Single Remote Machine (Invoke-Command)**

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName PC01 -ScriptBlock { Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object OsName, OsVersion } -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

- `-ComputerName PC01`: Specifies the target computer.
- `-ScriptBlock { ... }`: Defines the PowerShell script block to execute on the remote machine. Here, it gets computer information and selects the OS name and version.
- `-Credential (Get-Credential)`: Prompts for the username and password. This is the _most secure_ way to provide credentials. If you don't provide a credential, it will use your current user account. **Important:** The account provided must have administrative privileges on the remote machine.

**Example 2: Running a Command on Multiple Machines Listed in a Text File (Invoke-Command)**

```powershell
$computers = Get-Content -Path "computers.txt"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computers -ScriptBlock { Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object OsName, OsVersion } -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

This reads the list of computers from `computers.txt` and executes the same command on each one.

**Example 3: Running a Batch File on Multiple Machines (Invoke-Command)**

You can't directly execute a `.bat` file using `Invoke-Command`. Instead, you need to execute the `cmd.exe` interpreter and pass the batch file as an argument:

```powershell
$computers = Get-Content -Path "computers.txt"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computers -ScriptBlock { cmd.exe /c "C:\temp\update.bat" } -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

**Important:** Make sure the `update.bat` file exists in the specified location (`C:\temp\update.bat` in this example) on the remote machines. You might need to copy it there first using `Copy-Item`. Consider using a shared network folder accessible by all the computers.

**Example 4: Parallel Execution with PowerShell Remoting (using ForEach-Object -Parallel)**

PowerShell 7+ provides the `-Parallel` parameter for the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet, enabling parallel execution of remote commands.

```powershell
$computers = Get-Content -Path "computers.txt"

$computers | ForEach-Object -Parallel {
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $_ -ScriptBlock { Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object OsName, OsVersion } -Credential (Get-Credential)
}
```

This executes the `Invoke-Command` block concurrently on all machines in the `$computers` array. Be mindful of resource contention if running this on a large number of machines simultaneously.

**Pros of PowerShell Remoting:**

- More secure than PsExec due to encryption and authentication mechanisms.
- Powerful scripting capabilities through PowerShell.
- Can execute complex tasks and scripts.
- Good for automating tasks.
- Native to Windows and typically available without the need to download extra tools (provided remoting is enabled).
- Parallel execution possible using `ForEach-Object -Parallel` (PowerShell 7+).

**Cons of PowerShell Remoting:**

- Requires configuration (Enable-PSRemoting, TrustedHosts).
- Can be more complex to set up than PsExec.
- Slightly more overhead than PsExec.
- Firewall rules need to be configured correctly.

## 3. Batch Scripting with Parallel Execution (Custom Solution)

This method involves creating a batch script that uses the `start` command to launch multiple commands concurrently. This approach is simpler than PowerShell remoting but lacks the security features and robustness.

**How it Works:**

The `start` command launches a new command window (or process) without waiting for it to finish. By combining `start` with a loop, you can effectively run commands in parallel.

**Example:**

```plaintext
@echo off
setlocal

set "computers=PC01 PC02 PC03"
set "username=your_username"
set "password=your_password"

for %%a in (%computers%) do (
    start cmd /c psexec \\%%a -u %username% -p %password% cmd /c echo "Running command on %%a" >> output.txt 2>&1
)

endlocal
```

**Explanation:**

- `@echo off`: Disables command echoing.
- `setlocal`: Creates a local environment for variables.
- `set "computers=PC01 PC02 PC03"`: Defines a variable containing a space-separated list of computer names.
- `set "username=your_username"` and `set "password=your_password"`: Sets the username and password for authentication (replace with actual values or use a more secure method). _Avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts_.
- `for %%a in (%computers%) do (...)`: Loops through each computer name in the list.
- `start cmd /c psexec \\%%a -u %username% -p %password% cmd /c echo "Running command on %%a" >> output.txt 2>&1`: This is the core part.
  - `start`: Launches a new `cmd.exe` process in parallel.
  - `cmd /c psexec \\%%a ...`: Executes PsExec on the remote machine `%%a`. The `echo` command is just an example; replace it with the command you want to run.
  - `>> output.txt 2>&1`: Redirects the output of the command to a file named `output.txt`. `2>&1` redirects standard error to standard output.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** This script doesn't include robust error handling. You'll need to add error checking mechanisms to ensure commands are executed successfully.
- **Password Security:** _Avoid storing passwords directly in the script_. Consider using a secure password manager or prompting the user for credentials.
- **Resource Contention:** Launching too many processes simultaneously can overwhelm the system. Consider adding a delay between `start` commands or limiting the number of concurrent processes.
- **PsExec Dependency:** This example uses PsExec. You'll need to have PsExec installed and configured as described earlier.
- **Output Management:** The output is redirected to a single file (`output.txt`). You might want to modify the script to create separate output files for each machine.

**Pros of Batch Scripting with Parallel Execution:**

- Relatively simple to implement.
- Doesn't require PowerShell remoting configuration.
- Can be used to execute various commands.

**Cons of Batch Scripting with Parallel Execution:**

- Less secure than PowerShell remoting.
- Requires careful error handling.
- Can be resource-intensive if too many processes are launched simultaneously.
- Less robust than PowerShell remoting.
- Management of credentials and output can become complex.

## 4. Task Scheduler on Remote Machines (Less Recommended)

This method involves scheduling a task remotely on each PC. While possible, it's often more complex and less efficient than the other methods discussed. It's generally used for scheduled tasks rather than immediate command execution across multiple machines. Therefore, we won't provide detailed code examples for this method.

## Choosing the Right Method

The best method for running commands on multiple PCs depends on your specific requirements:

- **Security is paramount:** Use PowerShell Remoting.
- **Simplicity and quick execution are important:** Use PsExec (with appropriate security precautions).
- **Need parallel execution without PowerShell remoting:** Use Batch Scripting with Parallel Execution (but be careful with resource management and security).
- **Need to schedule tasks on multiple machines:** Consider Task Scheduler (but evaluate if other methods are more suitable).

## Conclusion

Running commands on multiple PCs simultaneously can significantly improve efficiency and productivity. By understanding the different methods available, you can choose the best approach for your specific needs. Remember to prioritize security and resource management when automating tasks on multiple machines. Always test your scripts thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying them to production systems. Good luck!
