# Fullscreenchange Event: Mastering Fullscreen Mode in HTML DOM

The `fullscreenchange` event in the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) is a powerful tool for detecting when an element enters or exits fullscreen mode. This allows web developers to create more engaging and immersive user experiences by dynamically adjusting the user interface and handling application logic based on the fullscreen state. This blog post will delve into the intricacies of the `fullscreenchange` event, providing comprehensive examples and best practices for its effective implementation.

## Understanding the Fullscreen API

Before diving into the `fullscreenchange` event, it's crucial to understand the Fullscreen API upon which it relies. The Fullscreen API provides a standardized way for web pages to request and control fullscreen mode for a specific element. This is particularly useful for video players, games, and other applications where a full-screen presentation enhances the user experience.

### Key Concepts of the Fullscreen API:

- **`requestFullscreen()`:** This method, available on any DOM element, initiates a request to enter fullscreen mode. The element on which this method is called becomes the fullscreen element.

- **`exitFullscreen()`:** This method, available on the `document` object, requests to exit fullscreen mode.

- **`document.fullscreenElement`:** This property returns the element that is currently in fullscreen mode, or `null` if no element is in fullscreen.

- **Vendor Prefixes:** Historically, browsers used vendor prefixes (like `webkit`, `moz`, and `ms`) for Fullscreen API implementations. While modern browsers largely support the standard API, it's good practice to include vendor-prefixed versions for broader compatibility.

## The `fullscreenchange` Event: Reacting to Fullscreen Transitions

The `fullscreenchange` event is fired on the `document` object whenever the browser transitions into or out of fullscreen mode. This event provides a notification that the fullscreen state has changed, enabling you to execute code to adapt your application accordingly.

### Listening for the `fullscreenchange` Event

To listen for the `fullscreenchange` event, you need to attach an event listener to the `document` object. Here's the basic syntax:

```plaintext
document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", fullscreenChangeHandler);

function fullscreenChangeHandler() {
  // Code to execute when fullscreen mode changes
  console.log("Fullscreen mode changed!");

  if (document.fullscreenElement) {
    console.log("Element in fullscreen:", document.fullscreenElement);
  } else {
    console.log("Exited fullscreen mode.");
  }
}
```

This code snippet adds an event listener to the `document` that listens for the `fullscreenchange` event. When the event is triggered, the `fullscreenChangeHandler` function is executed. This function checks `document.fullscreenElement` to determine if an element is currently in fullscreen and logs appropriate messages to the console.

### Vendor Prefix Considerations (For Older Browsers)

For broader compatibility with older browsers, you might need to check for vendor-prefixed event names:

```plaintext
document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", fullscreenChangeHandler);
document.addEventListener("webkitfullscreenchange", fullscreenChangeHandler);
document.addEventListener("mozfullscreenchange", fullscreenChangeHandler);
document.addEventListener("msfullscreenchange", fullscreenChangeHandler); // For IE11
```

While generally not needed with modern browsers, including these ensures support for legacy systems. You can also write a helper function to handle these prefixes more elegantly:

```plaintext
function addFullscreenChangeListener(callback) {
  document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", callback);
  document.addEventListener("webkitfullscreenchange", callback);
  document.addEventListener("mozfullscreenchange", callback);
  document.addEventListener("msfullscreenchange", callback); // For IE11
}

addFullscreenChangeListener(fullscreenChangeHandler);

function fullscreenChangeHandler() {
    // Code to execute when fullscreen mode changes
    console.log("Fullscreen mode changed!");

    if (document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement || document.mozFullScreenElement || document.msFullscreenElement) {
        console.log("Element in fullscreen");
    } else {
        console.log("Exited fullscreen mode.");
    }
}
```

This approach centralizes the event listener management and avoids repeating the same event handler function multiple times.

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of how you can utilize the `fullscreenchange` event to enhance your web applications.

### 1. Adjusting UI Elements on Fullscreen Transition

A common use case is to modify the user interface when entering or exiting fullscreen mode. For example, you might want to hide certain controls or display additional information when the application is in fullscreen.

```plaintext
const videoPlayer = document.getElementById("myVideo");
const fullscreenButton = document.getElementById("fullscreenButton");
const controlPanel = document.getElementById("controlPanel");

fullscreenButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (videoPlayer.requestFullscreen) {
    videoPlayer.requestFullscreen();
  } else if (videoPlayer.webkitRequestFullscreen) { /* Safari */
    videoPlayer.webkitRequestFullscreen();
  } else if (videoPlayer.msRequestFullscreen) { /* IE11 */
    videoPlayer.msRequestFullscreen();
  }
});


document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", () => {
  if (document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement || document.mozFullScreenElement || document.msFullscreenElement) {
    // In fullscreen mode
    controlPanel.style.display = "none"; // Hide the control panel
  } else {
    // Not in fullscreen mode
    controlPanel.style.display = "block"; // Show the control panel
  }
});
```

In this example, clicking the `fullscreenButton` triggers the fullscreen request. The `fullscreenchange` event listener then toggles the visibility of the `controlPanel` based on the current fullscreen state.

### 2. Dynamically Loading Assets

You can use the `fullscreenchange` event to load higher-resolution assets or adjust the quality of video playback when entering fullscreen mode, improving the visual experience for users.

```plaintext
const videoPlayer = document.getElementById("myVideo");
const fullscreenButton = document.getElementById("fullscreenButton");

fullscreenButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
    if (videoPlayer.requestFullscreen) {
        videoPlayer.requestFullscreen();
    } else if (videoPlayer.webkitRequestFullscreen) { /* Safari */
        videoPlayer.webkitRequestFullscreen();
    } else if (videoPlayer.msRequestFullscreen) { /* IE11 */
        videoPlayer.msRequestFullscreen();
    }
});


document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", () => {
  if (document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement || document.mozFullScreenElement || document.msFullscreenElement) {
    // In fullscreen mode
    videoPlayer.src = "high-resolution-video.mp4";
    videoPlayer.load(); // Reload the video to use the new source
  } else {
    // Not in fullscreen mode
    videoPlayer.src = "low-resolution-video.mp4";
    videoPlayer.load(); // Reload the video to use the new source
  }
});
```

This code dynamically switches the video source based on the fullscreen state, allowing for a better viewing experience when in fullscreen mode. Remember to include appropriate error handling in case the new video source fails to load.

### 3. Handling Game Logic

In game development, the `fullscreenchange` event can be used to pause or resume the game, adjust the game's resolution, or update game controls based on the fullscreen state.

```plaintext
let gamePaused = false;

document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", () => {
  if (document.fullscreenElement || document.webkitFullscreenElement || document.mozFullScreenElement || document.msFullscreenElement) {
    // In fullscreen mode
    console.log("Game is running in fullscreen.");
    if (gamePaused) {
      resumeGame();
      gamePaused = false;
    }
  } else {
    // Not in fullscreen mode
    console.log("Game is no longer in fullscreen.");
    pauseGame();
    gamePaused = true;
  }
});

function pauseGame() {
  // Implement your game pausing logic here
  console.log("Game paused!");
}

function resumeGame() {
  // Implement your game resuming logic here
  console.log("Game resumed!");
}
```

This example demonstrates pausing and resuming the game based on the fullscreen state. The `pauseGame()` and `resumeGame()` functions should contain the actual game logic for pausing and resuming the game loop and any necessary resources.

## Best Practices

- **Always Check `document.fullscreenElement`:** Before making changes to the UI or application state, always check the value of `document.fullscreenElement` (and its vendor-prefixed counterparts) to ensure you're responding to the correct state.

- **Handle Vendor Prefixes:** While not as crucial as before, consider including vendor prefixes for older browser compatibility. Using a helper function can simplify this process.

- **Debounce Event Handling (Optional):** In certain scenarios, the `fullscreenchange` event might fire multiple times in quick succession. Consider using debouncing to limit the frequency of your event handler execution.

- **Avoid Performance-Intensive Tasks:** The `fullscreenchange` event handler should be lightweight and execute quickly. Avoid performing computationally expensive tasks within the handler to maintain responsiveness. Delegate heavy tasks to asynchronous operations or web workers.

- **Accessibility Considerations:** Ensure your application remains accessible when in fullscreen mode. Provide clear visual cues and keyboard navigation options for users who may have difficulty using a mouse.

## Conclusion

The `fullscreenchange` event, combined with the Fullscreen API, empowers web developers to create rich, immersive experiences.
