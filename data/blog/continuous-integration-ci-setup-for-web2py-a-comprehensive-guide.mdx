# Continuous Integration (CI) Setup for Web2py: A Comprehensive Guide

Continuous Integration (CI) is a crucial practice in modern software development. It helps teams integrate code changes frequently, leading to early detection of integration bugs, faster feedback loops, and improved overall code quality. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide to setting up CI for your Web2py applications.

## What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a central repository. Each integration is then verified by an automated build and test process. This process typically involves:

- **Code Integration:** Developers frequently commit code changes to a shared repository (e.g., Git).
- **Automated Build:** The CI system automatically builds the application from the latest source code.
- **Automated Testing:** The CI system runs automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) to verify the code's functionality.
- **Reporting:** The CI system provides feedback to the developers on the build and test results.

## Why use CI with Web2py?

Web2py, with its RAD (Rapid Application Development) approach, benefits greatly from CI. Here's why:

- **Rapid Iteration:** Web2py's agile nature encourages frequent code changes. CI helps manage these changes efficiently.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Automated testing within the CI pipeline catches bugs early, preventing them from reaching production.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Consistent testing promotes better coding practices and reduces technical debt.
- **Automated Deployment:** CI can be integrated with automated deployment pipelines, streamlining the release process.
- **Collaboration:** CI provides a clear view of the project's health, fostering better collaboration among developers.

## Setting up CI for Web2py: Tools and Approaches

Several CI tools can be used with Web2py. We'll focus on two popular options: Travis CI and GitHub Actions.

### 1. Using Travis CI

Travis CI is a cloud-based CI service that integrates seamlessly with GitHub. It's free for open-source projects and offers paid plans for private repositories.

**Steps to Set up Travis CI for Web2py:**

1.  **Create a `.travis.yml` file:** This file defines the configuration for your Travis CI builds. Place this file in the root directory of your Web2py project.

    ```yaml
    language: python
    python:
      - '3.9' # Or your desired Python version

    install:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt # Install project dependencies
      - pip install web2py # Install web2py (if not already in requirements.txt)

    script:
      - python scripts/test_all.py # Your test script (see example below)

    notifications:
      email: false # Disable email notifications (optional)
    ```

2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file (optional but recommended):** List all the Python packages your Web2py application depends on. This ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed during the build process. You can generate this using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

3.  **Write a test script (`scripts/test_all.py`):** This script will run your Web2py tests. Web2py doesn't have a built-in testing framework. You can use `unittest`, `pytest`, or any other Python testing framework.

    ```plaintext
    # scripts/test_all.py
    import unittest
    import os
    import sys

    # Add your application directory to the Python path
    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath("applications/your_app"))

    # Import your test modules
    from tests import test_models, test_controllers # Example

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        loader = unittest.TestLoader()
        suite = unittest.TestSuite()

        # Add tests from your test modules
        suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(test_models))
        suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(test_controllers))

        runner = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2)
        result = runner.run(suite)

        if not result.wasSuccessful():
          sys.exit(1) # Exit with an error code if tests fail
    ```

    **Example Test Modules (e.g., `applications/your_app/tests/test_models.py`):**

    ```plaintext
    # applications/your_app/tests/test_models.py
    import unittest
    from models.db import db # Your Web2py database object
    # Import your models that you want to test

    class ModelTests(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            # Setup your test environment (e.g., create test database)
            pass

        def tearDown(self):
            # Clean up your test environment
            pass

        def test_example_model(self):
            # Add your tests here
            self.assertEqual(1,1) # Example test
            # db.define_table(...)
            # record = db.mytable.insert(...)
            # self.assertEqual(record.field, expected_value)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```

    **Important Considerations for Web2py Testing:**

    - **Database Setup:** You'll likely need to configure a separate test database to avoid modifying your production data. Consider using an in-memory database like SQLite for faster testing. Web2py makes this easy:

      ```plaintext
      from gluon import DAL

      # In your test setup:
      db = DAL('sqlite:memory')  # Use an in-memory SQLite database
      # Or, use a test database file:
      # db = DAL('sqlite:/tmp/test.db')
      ```

    - **Web2py Environment:** You might need to mock parts of the Web2py environment (e.g., `request`, `response`, `session`) in your tests, especially if your controllers interact with them directly. Consider using mocking libraries like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`.

4.  **Connect your GitHub repository to Travis CI:**

    - Sign up for Travis CI using your GitHub account.
    - Authorize Travis CI to access your GitHub repositories.
    - Enable Travis CI for your Web2py repository.

5.  **Commit your changes and push to GitHub:** Travis CI will automatically detect the `.travis.yml` file and start a build process.

**Example `applications/your_app/tests/test_controllers.py`:**

```plaintext
# applications/your_app/tests/test_controllers.py
import unittest
from gluon import HTTP
from gluon.html import URL
from gluon.globals import Request, Response, Session
from gluon.utils import web2py_logger

# Mock the Web2py environment if necessary
def mock_request():
    req = Request()
    req.application = 'your_app'  # Replace with your application name
    req.controller = 'default'  # Replace with your controller name
    req.function = 'index'     # Replace with your function name
    req.env = {}
    req.folder = 'applications/your_app'  # Replace with your application path

    return req

def mock_response():
    resp = Response()
    return resp

def mock_session():
    sess = Session()
    return sess

class ControllerTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
      self.request = mock_request()
      self.response = mock_response()
      self.session = mock_session()

      # Add your app to the system path
      import sys
      import os
      sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('applications/your_app'))
      #import your controller here

    def tearDown(self):
        pass


    def test_index_page(self):
        #import your controller here to call functions for testing
        #  from controllers import default
        #response = default.index()
        # Check something about the response or view
        # self.assertTrue('<h1>Welcome</h1>' in str(response))
        pass # Replace with actual tests

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### 2. Using GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides a CI/CD platform directly within GitHub. It uses YAML files to define workflows that automate your build, test, and deployment processes.

**Steps to Set up GitHub Actions for Web2py:**

1.  **Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:** Create this directory structure in the root of your repository if it doesn't exist. This file defines the workflow for your CI process.

    ```yaml
    name: Web2py CI

    on:
      push:
        branches: [main] # Or your main branch name
      pull_request:
        branches: [main]

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3

          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
              python-version: '3.9' # Or your desired Python version

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt
              pip install web2py # If not in requirements.txt

          - name: Run tests
            run: python scripts/test_all.py # Your test script
    ```

2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file (optional but recommended):** Same as with Travis CI.

3.  **Write a test script (`scripts/test_all.py`):** Same as with Travis CI.

4.  **Commit your changes and push to GitHub:** GitHub Actions will automatically detect the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file and start the workflow when you push changes to your repository or create a pull request.

**Advantages of GitHub Actions:**

- **Integrated with GitHub:** No need for external services.
- **Flexible Workflows:** Highly customizable workflows for various tasks.
- **Free for Public Repositories:** Generous free tier for open-source projects.

## Best Practices for Web2py CI

- **Isolate Your Environment:** Use virtual environments (venv) or Docker containers to isolate your Web2py application and its dependencies. This ensures consistent builds across different environments. For example, you can add this step in GitHub actions before dependency installation:

  ```yaml
  - name: Create and activate virtual environment
    run: |
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Test Database:** Use a dedicated test database (e.g., SQLite in-memory) to avoid modifying production data during testing.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Write thorough unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to cover all aspects of your application.
- **Clear Error Messages:** Ensure your test scripts provide clear and informative error messages to help you quickly identify and fix problems.
- **Code Coverage:** Use code coverage tools to measure the percentage of your code that is covered by tests. Aim for high code coverage to minimize the risk of undetected bugs.
- **Automated Deployment:** Integrate your CI pipeline with automated deployment tools to streamline the release process. You can add steps to your GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your application to a server or hosting platform.

## Integrating with Database Migrations

When your Web2py application involves database migrations or schema changes, it's crucial to integrate these into your CI process. You can use Web2py's built-in migration tools for this.

1. **Automatic Migrations:** Configure your `models/db.py` to use automatic migrations. This is the default behavior in Web2py and automatically updates the database schema based on model definitions.

2. **Test Database Migrations:** In your test setup (`scripts/test_all.py` or within a test module's `setUp()` method), ensure that the test database is properly migrated to the latest schema. You can use the `db.migrate()` method for this (be extremely careful with this in production!). A safer approach would be to reset the test database schema before each test run from a source controlled SQL dump.

## Example: Adding Code Coverage to GitHub Actions

To add code coverage reporting to your GitHub Actions workflow, you can use tools like `coverage.py`.

1.  **Install `coverage.py`:** Add `coverage` to your `requirements.txt` file or install it directly in your workflow:

    ```yaml
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install coverage # Install coverage.py
    ```

2.  **Run Tests with Coverage:** Modify your test script (`scripts/test_all.py`) to use `coverage.py`:

    ```plaintext
    # scripts/test_all.py
    import unittest
    import coverage
    import os
    import sys

    # Add your application directory to the Python path
    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath("applications/your_app"))

    # Import your test modules
    from tests import test_models, test_controllers # Example

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        cov = coverage.Coverage()
        cov.start()

        loader = unittest.TestLoader()
        suite = unittest.TestSuite()

        # Add tests from your test modules
        suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(test_models))
        suite.addTests(loader.loadTestsFromModule(test_controllers))

        runner = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2)
        result = runner.run(suite)

        cov.stop()
        cov.save()

        if not result.wasSuccessful():
          sys.exit(1) # Exit with an error code if tests fail

        cov.report() # Print coverage report to the console

        # Generate HTML report (optional)
        # cov.html_report()
    ```

3.  **Generate and Upload Coverage Report (Optional):** To visualize the code coverage report in GitHub Actions, you can generate an HTML report and upload it as an artifact:

    ```yaml
    - name: Run tests and generate coverage report
      run: |
        python -m coverage run scripts/test_all.py
        python -m coverage report
        python -m coverage html
        # Copy web2py files to the html coverage report output directory
        cp -r applications/your_app/ .coverage_html
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        fail_ci_if_error: true # optional (default = false)
    ```

4.  **Publish Coverage Results using Coveralls or Codecov:** Integrate with services like Coveralls or Codecov to track code coverage history and provide detailed reports. They provide badges that can be added to your README for a quick overview of code coverage.
