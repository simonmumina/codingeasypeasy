# Build a Real-Time Chat App with FastAPI and WebSockets: A Comprehensive Guide

Real-time applications are becoming increasingly popular, and chat applications are a prime example. In this guide, we'll walk you through building a real-time chat app using FastAPI and WebSockets in Python. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data exchange.

## Why FastAPI and WebSockets?

- **FastAPI:** Offers excellent performance, automatic data validation, API documentation, and ease of use.
- **WebSockets:** Enables bidirectional communication, crucial for real-time chat functionality. Unlike traditional HTTP requests which are one-directional (client to server), WebSockets allow for simultaneous communication in both directions (`client <-> server`). This makes them ideal for chat applications where messages need to be pushed to all connected users instantly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Basic understanding of Python and asynchronous programming (async/await)
- Familiarity with HTTP requests and responses

## Setting up the Project

1.  **Create a Project Directory:**

    ```plaintext
    mkdir fastapi-chat
    cd fastapi-chat
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

    ```plaintext
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets
    ```

    - `fastapi`: The core framework.
    - `uvicorn`: An ASGI server to run our FastAPI application.
    - `websockets`: Python library for handling WebSocket connections (usually included when installing FastAPI but explicitly mentioned here for clarity).

## Building the FastAPI Application

1.  **Create `main.py`:** This file will contain our FastAPI application logic.

    ```plaintext
    from typing import List

    from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
    from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

    app = FastAPI()

    html = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Chat</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>WebSocket Chat</h1>
            <form action="" onsubmit="sendMessage(event)">
                <input type="text" id="messageText" autocomplete="off"/>
                <button>Send</button>
            </form>
            <ul id='messages'>
            </ul>
            <script>
                var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/ws");
                ws.onmessage = function(event) {
                    var messages = document.getElementById('messages')
                    var message = document.createElement('li')
                    var content = document.createTextNode(event.data)
                    message.appendChild(content)
                    messages.appendChild(message)
                };
                function sendMessage(event) {
                    var input = document.getElementById("messageText")
                    ws.send(input.value)
                    input.value = ''
                    event.preventDefault()
                }
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
    """


    @app.get("/")
    async def get():
        return HTMLResponse(html)


    class ConnectionManager:
        def __init__(self):
            self.active_connections: List[WebSocket] = []

        async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket):
            await websocket.accept()
            self.active_connections.append(websocket)

        def disconnect(self, websocket: WebSocket):
            self.active_connections.remove(websocket)

        async def send_personal_message(self, message: str, websocket: WebSocket):
            await websocket.send_text(message)

        async def broadcast(self, message: str):
            for connection in self.active_connections:
                await connection.send_text(message)


    manager = ConnectionManager()


    @app.websocket("/ws")
    async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
        await manager.connect(websocket)
        try:
            while True:
                data = await websocket.receive_text()
                await manager.broadcast(f"Client says: {data}") # Broadcast message from client
        except WebSocketDisconnect:
            manager.disconnect(websocket)
            await manager.broadcast(f"Client left the chat") # Broadcast disconnect message
    ```

2.  **Explanation:**

    - **Import necessary modules:** `FastAPI`, `WebSocket`, `WebSocketDisconnect`, `HTMLResponse`
    - **Create a FastAPI app instance:** `app = FastAPI()`
    - **HTML Endpoint (`/`):** Serves a simple HTML page with a form for sending messages and a list to display them. This is a basic front-end written directly into the backend. A real application would use a separate front-end framework like React, Vue, or Angular.
    - **`ConnectionManager` Class:** Handles WebSocket connections:
      - `active_connections`: A list of all connected WebSocket clients.
      - `connect(websocket)`: Accepts a new WebSocket connection and adds it to the `active_connections` list.
      - `disconnect(websocket)`: Removes a WebSocket connection from the `active_connections` list when a client disconnects.
      - `send_personal_message(message, websocket)`: Sends a message to a specific WebSocket client. (Not currently used, but included for demonstration).
      - `broadcast(message)`: Sends a message to all connected WebSocket clients.
    - **WebSocket Endpoint (`/ws`):** Handles the WebSocket connection:
      - `websocket: WebSocket`: Injects a WebSocket instance.
      - `await manager.connect(websocket)`: Connects the WebSocket.
      - `try...except WebSocketDisconnect`: Handles the connection lifecycle. The `while True` loop keeps the connection open, listening for messages. When a client disconnects, a `WebSocketDisconnect` exception is raised.
      - `data = await websocket.receive_text()`: Receives text data from the client.
      - `await manager.broadcast(f"Client says: {data}")`: Broadcasts the message to all connected clients.
      - `manager.disconnect(websocket)`: Disconnects the WebSocket.
      - `await manager.broadcast(f"Client left the chat")`: Broadcasts a disconnect message.

## Running the Application

1.  **Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:**

    ```plaintext
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    - `main`: The name of your Python file (`main.py`).
    - `app`: The FastAPI instance within your Python file.
    - `--reload`: Enables automatic reloading of the server on code changes (useful during development).

2.  **Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`**. You'll see the simple chat interface. Open multiple browser windows or tabs to simulate different users. Type messages into the input field and press "Send." The messages should appear in all open chat windows.

## Code Breakdown and Explanation

Let's break down the key parts of the code:

- **`ConnectionManager` Class:** This class is crucial for managing the WebSocket connections. It keeps track of all active clients and provides methods for sending messages to specific clients or broadcasting messages to all clients. Using a class to manage connections makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

- **`@app.websocket("/ws")` Decorator:** This decorator registers a function to handle WebSocket connections at the specified endpoint (`/ws`). When a client attempts to establish a WebSocket connection at this endpoint, the decorated function (`websocket_endpoint`) will be executed.

- **`await websocket.accept()`:** This line is essential for accepting the incoming WebSocket connection. Until this line is executed, the connection remains in a pending state.

- **`await websocket.receive_text()`:** This line asynchronously waits for data (text messages) to be received from the client over the WebSocket connection.

- **`await websocket.send_text()`:** This line asynchronously sends text data to the client over the WebSocket connection.

- **`try...except WebSocketDisconnect` Block:** This block is used to gracefully handle WebSocket disconnections. When a client closes the connection, a `WebSocketDisconnect` exception is raised. The `except` block handles this exception, allowing us to perform cleanup tasks like removing the client from the list of active connections and broadcasting a disconnect message.

## Enhancements and Improvements

This is a basic chat application. Here are some ways you can enhance it:

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to identify users and manage permissions.
- **Database Integration:** Store messages in a database for persistence and retrieval.
- **Rooms/Channels:** Add support for creating and joining different chat rooms or channels.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling and logging.
- **Frontend Framework:** Use a frontend framework like React, Vue, or Angular for a richer user interface. This is almost essential for any real-world chat application.
- **Message Formatting:** Support message formatting (e.g., Markdown, HTML).
- **User Status:** Display user online/offline status.
- **Private Messaging:** Allow users to send private messages to each other.
- **Scalability:** Consider using message queues (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) for handling a large number of concurrent users.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

## Example: Adding User Authentication (Basic)

This is a very basic example and should not be used in production without proper security measures.

```plaintext
from typing import List, Optional

from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect, HTTPException, Depends
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from fastapi.security import HTTPBasic, HTTPBasicCredentials
from starlette import status

app = FastAPI()

# Basic Authentication (FOR DEMONSTRATION ONLY - USE A SECURE METHOD IN PRODUCTION)
security = HTTPBasic()


def get_current_user(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)):
    """
    This is a VERY SIMPLE authentication.  **DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.**
    Use a proper authentication system like OAuth2 or JWT.
    """
    if credentials.username == "admin" and credentials.password == "password":
        return credentials.username
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Incorrect username or password",
        headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"},
    )


html = """

        <ul id='messages'>
        </ul>
        <script>
            var username = prompt('Enter your username'); // Get username from prompt
            document.getElementById('username').innerText = username; // Display username

            var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/ws/" + username); // Include username in WebSocket URL

            ws.onmessage = function(event) {
                var messages = document.getElementById('messages')
                var message = document.createElement('li')
                var content = document.createTextNode(event.data)
                message.appendChild(content)
                messages.appendChild(message)
            };
            function sendMessage(event) {
                var input = document.getElementById("messageText")
                ws.send(username + ": " + input.value) // Include username in message
                input.value = ''
                event.preventDefault()
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
"""


@app.get("/")
async def get():
    return HTMLResponse(html)


class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_connections: List[WebSocket] = []

    async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket, username: str):
        await websocket.accept()
        websocket.username = username  # Store the username on the WebSocket object
        self.active_connections.append(websocket)

    def disconnect(self, websocket: WebSocket):
        self.active_connections.remove(websocket)

    async def send_personal_message(self, message: str, websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.send_text(message)

    async def broadcast(self, message: str):
        for connection in self.active_connections:
            await connection.send_text(message)


manager = ConnectionManager()


@app.websocket("/ws/{username}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, username: str):
    await manager.connect(websocket, username)
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            await manager.broadcast(f"{websocket.username} says: {data}") # Broadcast message from client
        except WebSocketDisconnect:
            manager.disconnect(websocket)
            await manager.broadcast(f"{websocket.username} left the chat") # Broadcast disconnect message
```

**Key Changes:**

- **Added `username` to WebSocket URL:** The client now connects to `/ws/{username}`.
- **Username Prompt:** The JavaScript code now prompts the user for a username.
- **Storing Username:** The `ConnectionManager` now stores the username on the `WebSocket` object itself (`websocket.username`).
- **Username in Messages:** The messages now include the username of the sender.
- **Removed the Basic Authentication Example:** It's not suitable for a real chat app as it's extremely basic. You should implement OAuth2 or JWT authentication instead. The prompt and passing the username through the websocket connection is also not secure and used here for demonstration purposes.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Security:** The authentication method used in this example is **extremely insecure** and should **never be used in a production environment**. Always use proper authentication techniques like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
- **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling. You should add error handling to gracefully handle potential issues like invalid usernames or connection errors.
- **Frontend Integration:** For a proper chat application, you will want a frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular) and a backend to handle the connection properly.
