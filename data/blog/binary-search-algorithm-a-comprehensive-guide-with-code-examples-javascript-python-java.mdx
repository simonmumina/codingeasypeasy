# Binary Search Algorithm: A Comprehensive Guide with Code Examples (JavaScript, Python, Java)

Binary search is a highly efficient search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a **sorted** array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. This makes it significantly faster than linear search, especially for large datasets. This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing binary search, including code examples in JavaScript, Python, and Java.

## What is Binary Search?

Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Here's the core principle:

1.  **Start with the entire sorted array.**
2.  **Find the middle element of the array.**
3.  **Compare the target value with the middle element:**
    - If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is successful, and the index of the middle element is returned.
    - If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the array.
    - If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the right half of the array.
4.  **Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.** An empty search interval indicates that the target value is not present in the array.

**Key Requirements:**

- **Sorted Array:** Binary search _only_ works on **sorted** arrays. If the array is not sorted, you must sort it first, which adds to the overall time complexity.
- **Random Access:** Binary Search needs the ability to access any element of the array in constant time.

## Why Use Binary Search?

The primary advantage of binary search is its **efficiency**. It has a time complexity of **O(log n)**, where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. This logarithmic time complexity means that the number of operations required to find the target value increases very slowly as the size of the array grows. Compare this to linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n). For large datasets, binary search provides a massive performance boost.

Consider an array with 1 million elements. A linear search might need to check up to 1 million elements in the worst case. A binary search, however, would need to check at most log2(1,000,000) â‰ˆ 20 elements.

## How to Implement Binary Search: A Step-by-Step Guide

Let's break down the implementation into logical steps:

1.  **Initialize `low` and `high`:** Set `low` to the index of the first element (0) and `high` to the index of the last element (`array.length - 1`).
2.  **Iterate:** Use a `while` loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. This ensures we haven't exhausted the search space.
3.  **Calculate `mid`:** Inside the loop, calculate the middle index `mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2)`. It's important to use `Math.floor` to get an integer index. A more robust calculation, especially for large arrays, is `mid = low + Math.floor((high - low) / 2)` to avoid potential integer overflow issues.
4.  **Compare:** Compare the target value with the element at `array[mid]`:
    - If `array[mid] === target`, return `mid`.
    - If `array[mid] < target`, the target value must be in the right half of the array. Update `low = mid + 1`.
    - If `array[mid] > target`, the target value must be in the left half of the array. Update `high = mid - 1`.
5.  **Not Found:** If the loop finishes without finding the target value (i.e., `low > high`), return -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.

## Code Examples

Here are implementations of binary search in JavaScript, Python, and Java:

### JavaScript

```plaintext
function binarySearch(array, target) {
  let low = 0
  let high = array.length - 1

  while (low <= high) {
    const mid = low + Math.floor((high - low) / 2) // Avoid potential integer overflow

    if (array[mid] === target) {
      return mid
    } else if (array[mid] < target) {
      low = mid + 1
    } else {
      high = mid - 1
    }
  }

  return -1 // Target not found
}

// Example usage
const sortedArray = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
const targetValue = 13
const index = binarySearch(sortedArray, targetValue)

if (index !== -1) {
  console.log(`Target ${targetValue} found at index ${index}`)
} else {
  console.log(`Target ${targetValue} not found in the array`)
}
```

### Python

```plaintext
def binary_search(array, target):
  low = 0
  high = len(array) - 1

  while low <= high:
    mid = low + (high - low) // 2  # Avoid potential integer overflow

    if array[mid] == target:
      return mid
    elif array[mid] < target:
      low = mid + 1
    else:
      high = mid - 1

  return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage
sorted_array = [2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]
target_value = 11
index = binary_search(sorted_array, target_value)

if index != -1:
  print(f"Target {target_value} found at index {index}")
else:
  print(f"Target {target_value} not found in the array")
```

### Java

```plaintext
public class BinarySearch {

  public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = array.length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
      int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Avoid potential integer overflow

      if (array[mid] == target) {
        return mid;
      } else if (array[mid] < target) {
        low = mid + 1;
      } else {
        high = mid - 1;
      }
    }

    return -1; // Target not found
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] sortedArray = {2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12};
    int targetValue = 7;
    int index = binarySearch(sortedArray, targetValue);

    if (index != -1) {
      System.out.println("Target " + targetValue + " found at index " + index);
    } else {
      System.out.println("Target " + targetValue + " not found in the array");
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation of Code Examples:**

- Each example implements the same core binary search logic.
- The `while` loop continues as long as the `low` index is less than or equal to the `high` index.
- The `mid` index is calculated using `low + (high - low) / 2` to prevent potential integer overflow errors, especially for very large arrays. This is a crucial optimization.
- The code compares the element at the `mid` index with the `target` and adjusts the `low` or `high` index accordingly.
- If the target is found, the `mid` index is returned.
- If the loop completes without finding the target, -1 is returned.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) - Logarithmic. This is the primary advantage of binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant. Binary search only requires a few variables (low, high, mid) and does not require any additional data structures that scale with the input size. This makes it very memory efficient.

## Common Mistakes and Considerations

- **Unsorted Array:** Forgetting that binary search requires a sorted array is the most common mistake. Always ensure the array is sorted before applying binary search.
- **Integer Overflow:** The formula `mid = (low + high) / 2` can cause integer overflow when `low` and `high` are very large. Using `mid = low + (high - low) / 2` avoids this issue. The provided code examples use this safer approach.
- **Off-by-One Errors:** Be careful with the `low = mid + 1` and `high = mid - 1` updates. Ensure these adjustments are correct to avoid missing the target value.
- **Iterative vs. Recursive:** While binary search can be implemented recursively, the iterative approach is generally preferred for its lower overhead and stack space usage.

## Variations of Binary Search

There are several variations of binary search that address specific scenarios:

- **Finding the First Occurrence:** Modify the algorithm to find the index of the _first_ occurrence of a target value when duplicates are present. Instead of immediately returning `mid` when `array[mid] === target`, continue searching the left half to see if an earlier occurrence exists.
- **Finding the Last Occurrence:** Similar to finding the first occurrence, modify the algorithm to find the index of the _last_ occurrence of a target value.
- **Binary Search in a Rotated Sorted Array:** Adapt the algorithm to search in a sorted array that has been rotated by some unknown amount. This requires carefully handling the potential for the search interval to be split across the "rotation point."
- **Binary Search in a 2D Array:** If a 2D array has certain properties (e.g., each row and column are sorted), you can extend binary search to find a target value.

## Applications of Binary Search

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm with numerous applications, including:

- **Searching in Sorted Data:** The most obvious application.
- **Finding the Square Root of a Number:** Binary search can efficiently approximate the square root of a number.
- **Finding the Floor or Ceiling of a Value:** Given a target value, find the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to the target (floor) or the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the target (ceiling).
- **Debugging:** Quickly narrow down the location of a bug by systematically checking sections of code.
