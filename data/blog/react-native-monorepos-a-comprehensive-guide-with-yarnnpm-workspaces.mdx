# React Native Monorepos: A Comprehensive Guide with Yarn/NPM Workspaces

Monorepos, a single repository containing multiple projects, are gaining significant traction in modern software development.  They offer numerous advantages, particularly for projects with shared code or dependencies.  This guide will walk you through how to effectively utilize a monorepo structure with React Native using Yarn or NPM workspaces, unlocking benefits like code reusability, simplified dependency management, and enhanced collaboration.

## What is a Monorepo?

A monorepo is a single repository that holds multiple projects, libraries, and applications.  This is in contrast to the traditional "polyrepo" approach, where each project resides in its own separate repository.  In the context of React Native, this could mean having your mobile app, a shared component library, and a web application (using React Native for Web, for example) all within the same repository.

## Why Use a Monorepo with React Native?

Choosing a monorepo approach for your React Native projects offers several compelling advantages:

*   **Code Sharing and Reusability:**  Easily share components, utilities, and business logic between your React Native app, web app (if applicable), and other projects within the repository. This reduces code duplication and promotes consistency.
*   **Simplified Dependency Management:**  Dependencies can be managed centrally for all projects within the monorepo.  This avoids version conflicts and ensures that all projects use compatible dependencies.  Yarn and NPM workspaces excel at this.
*   **Atomic Changes:** Make changes that span multiple projects within a single commit. This ensures that related changes are always applied together, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
*   **Improved Collaboration:**  Teams can easily work on multiple projects within the same repository, fostering better communication and collaboration.
*   **Consistent Tooling:**  Use the same linters, formatters, and build tools across all projects in the monorepo, ensuring consistency in code quality and development practices.
*   **Easier Refactoring:** Large-scale refactoring becomes simpler when all code is in one place.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:**  Version 16 or higher is recommended.
*   **Yarn or NPM:**  Choose either Yarn (v1.0+) or NPM (v7+).  We'll provide examples for both.
*   **React Native CLI:** Install globally: `npm install -g react-native-cli` or `yarn global add react-native-cli`.
*   **Android Studio/Xcode:** Configure your development environment for native development.

## Setting up a Monorepo with Yarn Workspaces

Yarn workspaces provide a streamlined way to manage dependencies and link packages within a monorepo.

**1. Initialize the Monorepo:**

Create a new directory for your monorepo:

```bash
mkdir react-native-monorepo
cd react-native-monorepo
```

Initialize the repository with `yarn init`:

```bash
yarn init -y
```

**2. Configure Yarn Workspaces:**

Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "react-native-monorepo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,  // Important: prevents accidental publishing of the root package.
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*",
    "apps/*"
  ],
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "^8.0.0" // Optional: For advanced monorepo management
  },
  "scripts": {
    "bootstrap": "yarn install", // Helpful script to install all dependencies
    "start:mobile": "yarn workspace mobile start",
    "start:web": "yarn workspace web start",
    "lint": "yarn workspaces run lint",
    "test": "yarn workspaces run test"
  }
}
```

*   `"private": true` prevents the root package from being accidentally published to NPM.
*   `"workspaces": ["packages/*", "apps/*"]` tells Yarn where to find the packages and applications within the monorepo.  Adjust these paths based on your desired directory structure.  `packages` is typically for shared components/libraries, and `apps` for your applications (mobile, web, etc.).
*   `"lerna": "^8.0.0"` Lerna is an optional tool that simplifies the management of multi-package repositories, especially for versioning and publishing.  It's useful for larger monorepos.
*   `scripts` are helper scripts.  `bootstrap` installs all dependencies.  `start:mobile` and `start:web` run the start script in the `mobile` and `web` workspaces respectively. `lint` and `test` runs linters and tests in all workspaces.

**3. Create Packages and Apps:**

Create the `packages` and `apps` directories, and then create your React Native app and a shared component library.

```bash
mkdir packages
mkdir apps

# Create a shared component library
mkdir packages/ui-library
cd packages/ui-library
yarn init -y
yarn add react react-native  // Peer dependencies

# Create a React Native app
cd ../../apps
mkdir apps/mobile
cd apps/mobile
yarn create react-native-app AwesomeMobileApp  # Or using Expo:  npx create-expo-app AwesomeMobileApp
```

This creates:

*   `packages/ui-library`:  A shared component library that you can use across your applications.
*   `apps/mobile`:  Your React Native application.

**4.  Configure the Shared Component Library (packages/ui-library/package.json):**

```json
{
  "name": "@my-monorepo/ui-library",  // Use a scoped package name
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "*",
    "react-native": "*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
     "@babel/core": "^7.0.0",
     "@babel/runtime": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "scripts":{
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

*   **`name`:** Use a scoped package name (e.g., `@my-monorepo/ui-library`) to avoid naming conflicts on NPM.  Replace `my-monorepo` with your organization's name.
*   **`main`:**  Specifies the entry point for your library.
*   **`peerDependencies`:**  List `react` and `react-native` as peer dependencies.  This indicates that the consumer of your library (e.g., your React Native app) is responsible for providing these dependencies.  This prevents version conflicts.
*   **`devDependencies`:** Include Babel for transpilation and other development tools.
*   **`scripts`:**  Helpful scripts for linting, formatting, etc.

**5. Create a Simple Component (packages/ui-library/index.js):**

```javascript
// packages/ui-library/index.js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const CustomButton = ({ title }) => {
  return <Text style={styles.button}>{title}</Text>;
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    color: 'white',
    padding: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});

export default CustomButton;
```

**6. Install Dependencies:**

Run `yarn install` in the root directory of your monorepo.  This will install all dependencies for all packages and apps in a single step, hoisting shared dependencies to the root `node_modules` directory to save space and improve performance.

```bash
yarn install
```

**7.  Use the Shared Component in Your React Native App (apps/mobile/App.js):**

First, add the UI library as a dependency to your React Native app:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
yarn add @my-monorepo/ui-library
```

Then, import and use the component in your `App.js` file:

```javascript
// apps/mobile/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';
import CustomButton from '@my-monorepo/ui-library'; // Import the shared component

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <CustomButton title="Click Me!" />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
  content: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**8. Start Your React Native App:**

```bash
yarn start
```

Or, use the convenience script defined in the root package.json:

```bash
yarn start:mobile
```

Your React Native app should now render the `CustomButton` component from your shared UI library.

## Setting up a Monorepo with NPM Workspaces

NPM workspaces provide similar functionality to Yarn workspaces but are built directly into NPM.

**1. Initialize the Monorepo:**

Create a new directory for your monorepo:

```bash
mkdir react-native-monorepo-npm
cd react-native-monorepo-npm
```

Initialize the repository with `npm init -y`:

```bash
npm init -y
```

**2. Configure NPM Workspaces:**

Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "react-native-monorepo-npm",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,  // Important: prevents accidental publishing of the root package.
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*",
    "apps/*"
  ],
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "^8.0.0" // Optional: For advanced monorepo management
  },
  "scripts": {
    "bootstrap": "npm install", // Helpful script to install all dependencies
    "start:mobile": "npm run start --workspace mobile",
    "start:web": "npm run start --workspace web",
    "lint": "npm run lint --workspaces",
    "test": "npm run test --workspaces"
  }
}
```

*   `"private": true` prevents the root package from being accidentally published to NPM.
*   `"workspaces": ["packages/*", "apps/*"]` tells NPM where to find the packages and applications within the monorepo.  Adjust these paths based on your desired directory structure.  `packages` is typically for shared components/libraries, and `apps` for your applications (mobile, web, etc.).
*   `"lerna": "^8.0.0"` Lerna is an optional tool that simplifies the management of multi-package repositories, especially for versioning and publishing.  It's useful for larger monorepos.
*   `scripts` are helper scripts.  `bootstrap` installs all dependencies. Note the different syntax for running scripts in workspaces with NPM.

**3. Create Packages and Apps:**

Create the `packages` and `apps` directories, and then create your React Native app and a shared component library. (Same as with Yarn)

```bash
mkdir packages
mkdir apps

# Create a shared component library
mkdir packages/ui-library
cd packages/ui-library
npm init -y
npm install react react-native  // Peer dependencies

# Create a React Native app
cd ../../apps
mkdir apps/mobile
cd apps/mobile
npx react-native init AwesomeMobileApp  # Or using Expo:  npx create-expo-app AwesomeMobileApp
```

This creates:

*   `packages/ui-library`:  A shared component library that you can use across your applications.
*   `apps/mobile`:  Your React Native application.

**4.  Configure the Shared Component Library (packages/ui-library/package.json):**

```json
{
  "name": "@my-monorepo-npm/ui-library",  // Use a scoped package name
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "*",
    "react-native": "*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
     "@babel/core": "^7.0.0",
     "@babel/runtime": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "scripts":{
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

*   **`name`:** Use a scoped package name (e.g., `@my-monorepo-npm/ui-library`) to avoid naming conflicts on NPM.  Replace `my-monorepo-npm` with your organization's name.
*   **`main`:**  Specifies the entry point for your library.
*   **`peerDependencies`:**  List `react` and `react-native` as peer dependencies.  This indicates that the consumer of your library (e.g., your React Native app) is responsible for providing these dependencies.  This prevents version conflicts.
*   **`devDependencies`:** Include Babel for transpilation and other development tools.
*   **`scripts`:**  Helpful scripts for linting, formatting, etc.

**5. Create a Simple Component (packages/ui-library/index.js):**

```javascript
// packages/ui-library/index.js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const CustomButton = ({ title }) => {
  return <Text style={styles.button}>{title}</Text>;
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    color: 'white',
    padding: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});

export default CustomButton;
```

**6. Install Dependencies:**

Run `npm install` in the root directory of your monorepo.  This will install all dependencies for all packages and apps in a single step, hoisting shared dependencies to the root `node_modules` directory to save space and improve performance.

```bash
npm install
```

**7.  Use the Shared Component in Your React Native App (apps/mobile/App.js):**

First, add the UI library as a dependency to your React Native app:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install @my-monorepo-npm/ui-library
```

Then, import and use the component in your `App.js` file:

```javascript
// apps/mobile/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';
import CustomButton from '@my-monorepo-npm/ui-library'; // Import the shared component

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <CustomButton title="Click Me!" />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
  content: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

**8. Start Your React Native App:**

```bash
npm start
```

Or, use the convenience script defined in the root package.json:

```bash
npm run start:mobile
```

Your React Native app should now render the `CustomButton` component from your shared UI library.

## Advanced Monorepo Management with Lerna (Optional)

Lerna is a powerful tool for managing larger monorepos.  It automates tasks like versioning, publishing, and running commands across multiple packages.

**1. Install Lerna:**

```bash
yarn add lerna --dev  # Or npm install lerna --save-dev
```

**2. Initialize Lerna:**

```bash
npx lerna init
```

**3. Configure Lerna:**

Lerna uses a `lerna.json` file to configure its behavior.  A basic configuration might look like this:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "packages/*",
    "apps/*"
  ],
  "version": "independent", // Or a fixed version
  "npmClient": "yarn", // Or npm
  "useWorkspaces": true
}
```

*   `packages`:  Specifies the location of packages and apps within the monorepo.
*   `version`:  Determines how Lerna versions packages.  `independent` allows each package to have its own version, while a fixed version synchronizes all packages to the same version.
*   `npmClient`: Specifies which package manager is used (yarn or npm).
*   `useWorkspaces`:  Set to true to integrate with Yarn/NPM workspaces.

**4. Using Lerna:**

Lerna provides several useful commands:

*   `lerna bootstrap`:  Installs dependencies for all packages in the monorepo (similar to `yarn install`).
*   `lerna changed`:  Lists packages that have changed since the last release.
*   `lerna publish`:  Publishes packages to NPM.  This command is particularly useful when using `version: independent`.
*   `lerna run <script>`: Runs a specified script (defined in `package.json`) in all packages or in packages that have changed.

## Best Practices

*   **Scoped Package Names:** Use scoped package names (e.g., `@my-monorepo/my-package`) to avoid naming conflicts on NPM.
*   **Peer Dependencies:**  Declare shared dependencies like `react` and `react-native` as peer dependencies in your shared libraries.
*   **Version Management:**  Choose a versioning strategy that suits your needs.  `independent` versioning is often preferred for libraries, while fixed versioning might be appropriate for applications.
*   **Testing:**  Implement thorough testing for all packages in the monorepo.
*   **Code Style:** Enforce consistent code style across all projects using linters and formatters.
*   **CI/CD:**  Integrate your monorepo with a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment.
*   **Documentation:**  Document the structure of your monorepo and the purpose of each package.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Dependency Conflicts:**  If you encounter dependency conflicts, try running `yarn install --force` or `npm install --force` (with caution).  Review your dependencies and ensure that all packages are using compatible versions.
*   **Module Resolution Issues:**  If you have trouble resolving modules within your monorepo, double-check your `workspaces` configuration and ensure that the package names are correctly referenced.  Restarting your Metro bundler (for React Native) can also sometimes resolve these issues.
*   **Metro Bundler Issues:**  Sometimes Metro bundler needs to be cleared. Try `yarn start --reset-cache` in your React Native app's directory.

## Conclusion

Monorepos, when combined with Yarn or NPM workspaces, offer a powerful approach to structuring and managing React Native projects. By embracing code sharing, simplified dependency management, and streamlined workflows, you can significantly improve the efficiency and maintainability of your React Native development process.  Remember to start small, experiment with different approaches, and tailor your monorepo setup to the specific needs of your project.
