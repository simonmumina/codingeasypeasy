# How to Install and Configure Apache Web Server on CentOS (Step-by-Step Guide)

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of installing and configuring the Apache web server (httpd) on CentOS Linux. Apache is one of the most popular web servers in the world, known for its reliability, security, and extensive features. Whether you're setting up a new website, hosting a web application, or learning about web server administration, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to get Apache up and running smoothly on your CentOS system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A CentOS server (CentOS 7, CentOS 8, or CentOS Stream supported)
- Root or `sudo` privileges on the server
- A stable internet connection

## Step 1: Update System Packages

It's always a good practice to start by updating your system's package index to ensure you have the latest available versions.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

This command updates all packages installed on your system to their latest versions. The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to any prompts during the update process.

## Step 2: Install Apache (httpd)

The Apache web server package is named `httpd` in CentOS. Use the following command to install it:

```bash
sudo yum install httpd -y
```

This command installs the `httpd` package and any necessary dependencies.

## Step 3: Start and Enable Apache

Once the installation is complete, start the Apache service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

To ensure that Apache starts automatically after each reboot, enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

You can verify that Apache is running using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

This command displays the status of the `httpd` service, including whether it's active, running, or failed. You should see a line that says "Active: active (running)" if Apache is working correctly.

## Step 4: Configure the Firewall

CentOS uses `firewalld` as its default firewall. You need to configure the firewall to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
```

These commands add the `http` and `https` services to the firewall's permanent configuration. The `--permanent` flag ensures that the changes persist after a reboot.

Next, reload the firewall to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

You can verify that the firewall rules have been added correctly by listing the enabled services:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

This command displays all the firewall rules, including the allowed services. You should see `http` and `https` in the list of services.

## Step 5: Test the Installation

Open your web browser and navigate to the IP address of your CentOS server. If you're unsure of your server's IP address, you can find it by running:

```bash
ip addr show
```

Look for the IP address associated with your network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `enp0s3`).

If Apache is installed correctly, you should see the default Apache test page. This confirms that the web server is running and accessible from your network.

## Step 6: Configure Virtual Hosts (Optional)

Virtual hosts allow you to host multiple websites on a single server. To configure a virtual host, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a directory for your website's files:**

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/www/yourdomain.com/html
    ```

    Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name. This creates a directory structure to store your website's files.

2.  **Set ownership and permissions:**

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/yourdomain.com/html
    sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/yourdomain.com
    ```

    These commands set the ownership and permissions of the directory to allow your user to manage the website's files.

3.  **Create a virtual host configuration file:**

    Create a new configuration file for your virtual host in the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/yourdomain.com.conf
    ```

    Replace `yourdomain.com.conf` with a descriptive name for your configuration file.

4.  **Add the following configuration to the file:**

    ```plaintext
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/html
        ServerName yourdomain.com
        ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
        ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/yourdomain.com_error.log
        CustomLog /var/log/httpd/yourdomain.com_access.log combined

        <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

    Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name and `webmaster@yourdomain.com` with your email address. This configuration defines the virtual host, specifies the document root (where your website files are located), sets the server name and alias, and configures logging. The `<Directory>` section allows Apache to access the files in the document root.

5.  **Restart Apache:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

6.  **Create an `index.html` file**

Create a simple `index.html` file in the `/var/www/yourdomain.com/html` directory:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/yourdomain.com/html/index.html
```

Add the following content to the file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Welcome to yourdomain.com!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Success! The yourdomain.com virtual host is working!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

7. **Update your hosts file (for local testing):**

If you don't have a domain name registered or want to test locally, add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file on _your client machine_ (not the server):

```
your_server_ip yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com
```

Replace `your_server_ip` with the IP address of your CentOS server. This will redirect requests for `yourdomain.com` and `www.yourdomain.com` to your server.

Now, open your web browser and navigate to `yourdomain.com`. You should see the content of your `index.html` file.

## Step 7: Secure Apache with SSL/TLS (HTTPS) (Highly Recommended)

Securing your Apache web server with SSL/TLS is crucial for encrypting communication between your server and clients, protecting sensitive data. Let's Encrypt provides free SSL/TLS certificates.

1.  **Install Certbot:**

    Certbot is a tool that simplifies the process of obtaining and installing Let's Encrypt certificates.

    ```bash
    sudo yum install epel-release -y  # Install EPEL repository (if not already installed)
    sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
    ```

2.  **Obtain and install the SSL certificate:**

    ```bash
    sudo certbot --apache -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
    ```

    Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name. Certbot will automatically configure Apache to use the SSL certificate. It will ask you for your email address and agree to the terms of service.

3.  **Configure automatic certificate renewal:**

    Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Certbot can automatically renew your certificates before they expire. A cron job is typically configured during installation. You can test the renewal process with:

    ```bash
    sudo certbot renew --dry-run
    ```

    This simulates the renewal process without actually renewing the certificate.

4.  **Verify HTTPS:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `https://yourdomain.com`. You should see a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating that the connection is secure.

## Step 8: Basic Security Hardening (Important)

Here are a few basic security hardening steps you can take:

- **Disable Server Signature:** Prevent Apache from displaying detailed information about the server version and operating system. Edit the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` file and add the following lines:

  ```plaintext
  ServerSignature Off
  ServerTokens Prod
  ```

  Restart Apache after making these changes.

- **Disable Directory Listing:** Prevent Apache from displaying a list of files in a directory if no index file is present. In your virtual host configuration, ensure the `Options` directive does _not_ include `Indexes`. For example:

  ```plaintext
  <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride All
      Require all granted
  </Directory>
  ```

  Restart Apache after making changes.

- **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Regularly update your CentOS system and Apache to patch security vulnerabilities. Use `sudo yum update -y` to update your system.
