# Speed Up Your Storybook: A Comprehensive Guide to Storybook Addon SWC

Storybook is a fantastic tool for developing UI components in isolation. However, as projects grow, Storybook's build and development times can become a bottleneck, especially when relying on Babel for transformation.  Enter **Storybook Addon SWC**, a game-changer that leverages the Rust-based SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) to dramatically improve your Storybook's performance.

This comprehensive guide dives deep into Storybook Addon SWC, exploring its benefits, installation process, configuration options, and potential pitfalls, ensuring you can leverage its power to the fullest and significantly speed up your Storybook workflows.

## What is SWC and Why Use It with Storybook?

SWC is a next-generation Rust-based platform for the next generation fast developer tools. It can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, testing, and more.  Its key advantage over Babel is its **performance**.  SWC is significantly faster, often showing speed improvements of 5-20x compared to Babel.

In the context of Storybook, SWC replaces Babel as the primary compiler for your components and stories. This translates to:

*   **Faster build times:** Spend less time waiting for Storybook to build, allowing you to iterate more quickly.
*   **Faster development times:** Experience quicker hot module reloading (HMR) and faster initial load times, making your development process smoother.
*   **Improved overall performance:** A more responsive Storybook experience.

By switching to SWC, you can unlock a more efficient and enjoyable component development experience.

## Installing Storybook Addon SWC

The installation process is straightforward. Using npm, yarn, or pnpm, install the addon:

**npm:**

```bash
npm install -D @storybook/addon-swc
```

**yarn:**

```bash
yarn add -D @storybook/addon-swc
```

**pnpm:**

```bash
pnpm add -D @storybook/addon-swc
```

Once installed, register the addon in your `.storybook/main.js` (or `.storybook/main.ts`) file:

```javascript
// .storybook/main.js (or .storybook/main.ts)
module.exports = {
  stories: ["../src/**/*.stories.mdx", "../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"],
  addons: [
    "@storybook/addon-links",
    "@storybook/addon-essentials",
    "@storybook/addon-interactions",
    "@storybook/addon-swc", // Add the SWC addon here
  ],
  framework: {
    name: "@storybook/react-webpack5",
    options: {},
  },
  docs: {
    autodocs: "tag",
  },
};
```

That's it! Storybook should now be using SWC to compile your components.  You'll likely see a noticeable improvement in build and development speeds right away.

## Configuring Storybook Addon SWC

While the default configuration often works well, you may need to customize SWC's behavior to match your project's specific requirements.  This can be done via the `swcOptions` property within the addon's configuration in `.storybook/main.js`.

```javascript
// .storybook/main.js (or .storybook/main.ts)
module.exports = {
  stories: ["../src/**/*.stories.mdx", "../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"],
  addons: [
    "@storybook/addon-links",
    "@storybook/addon-essentials",
    "@storybook/addon-interactions",
    [
      "@storybook/addon-swc",
      {
        swcOptions: {
          // Add your SWC options here
          jsc: {
            parser: {
              syntax: "typescript",
              jsx: true,
              decorators: true,
            },
            transform: {
              react: {
                runtime: "automatic", // or "classic"
                refresh: true, // Important for HMR!
              },
              optimizer: {
                simplify: false, // Prevent optimizations in specific cases.
              },
            },
          },
          module: {
            type: 'es6',  // or 'commonjs',
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
  framework: {
    name: "@storybook/react-webpack5",
    options: {},
  },
  docs: {
    autodocs: "tag",
  },
};
```

Let's break down some of the common configuration options:

*   **`jsc.parser`:**  Configures the JavaScript/TypeScript parser.  Crucially, ensure `jsx: true` if you're using JSX in your components. The `decorators: true` is necessary if you are using class decorators.

*   **`jsc.transform.react`:** Configures React-specific transformations.
    *   `runtime`:  Specifies the React runtime ("automatic" for React 17+ with automatic JSX transform, or "classic" for older versions).
    *   `refresh`:  **Very important for enabling Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**.  Make sure this is set to `true` for a smooth development experience.

*   **`module.type`:**  Specifies the module type.  `es6` is recommended for modern projects using ES modules. `commonjs` can be used if your project depends on CommonJS modules.

**Example: Setting the React Runtime and Enabling Refresh**

If you are using React 17 or later, this is a standard configuration:

```javascript
// .storybook/main.js (or .storybook/main.ts)
module.exports = {
  stories: ["../src/**/*.stories.mdx", "../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"],
  addons: [
    "@storybook/addon-links",
    "@storybook/addon-essentials",
    "@storybook/addon-interactions",
    [
      "@storybook/addon-swc",
      {
        swcOptions: {
          jsc: {
            parser: {
              syntax: "typescript",
              jsx: true,
            },
            transform: {
              react: {
                runtime: "automatic",
                refresh: true,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
  framework: {
    name: "@storybook/react-webpack5",
    options: {},
  },
  docs: {
    autodocs: "tag",
  },
};
```

**Important:** Refer to the official SWC documentation ([https://swc.rs/docs/configuration/swcrc](https://swc.rs/docs/configuration/swcrc)) for a comprehensive list of available configuration options.  These options are passed directly to SWC, so understanding the SWC configuration is key to fine-tuning the addon's behavior.

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

While Storybook Addon SWC is generally easy to use, you might encounter some issues. Here are a few common problems and their solutions:

*   **"Module not found" errors:** If you encounter module resolution errors, ensure your `tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript projects) and webpack configuration (if you have a custom one) are correctly set up to resolve your modules. SWC uses your project's existing configuration; it doesn't replace it completely.

*   **HMR not working:**  Double-check that `jsc.transform.react.refresh` is set to `true` in your `swcOptions`.  Also, ensure that your Storybook version is compatible with HMR.  Sometimes, other addons can interfere with HMR, so try temporarily disabling other addons to see if that resolves the issue. Consider restarting your Storybook server after making configuration changes.

*   **Syntax errors:** If you're getting syntax errors, review your SWC configuration, particularly the `jsc.parser` section. Make sure it's configured correctly for your project's syntax (TypeScript, JSX, decorators, etc.).

*   **Unexpected behavior:**  If you notice unexpected behavior after switching to SWC, try simplifying your SWC configuration.  Start with the minimal configuration and gradually add options until you identify the source of the problem.  Also, make sure your dependencies are up-to-date.

*   **Conflicts with Existing Babel Configuration:** If you have a complex Babel configuration in your project (e.g., in `babel.config.js` or `.babelrc`), there might be conflicts.  Consider removing or simplifying your Babel configuration since SWC is now handling the compilation.  In some cases, you might need to maintain a minimal Babel configuration for specific transformations that SWC doesn't yet support, but try to minimize its use.

*   **Incompatible Dependencies:** Some older libraries or dependencies might not be fully compatible with SWC. If you encounter issues with specific libraries, check if there are updated versions or alternative libraries that are SWC-compatible.

**Example: Debugging HMR Issues**

If HMR isn't working, try this:

1.  **Verify `refresh` is true:**  Double-check your `.storybook/main.js` and ensure that `jsc.transform.react.refresh` is set to `true` within the `swcOptions`.

2.  **Restart Storybook:** Sometimes a simple restart is all it takes.

3.  **Check the console:** Look for any error messages related to HMR in your browser's developer console or in the terminal where you're running Storybook.

4.  **Temporary disable other addons:** Temporarily remove all other addons to isolate if HMR is working.  If it works in isolation then gradually add other addons back until you find the conflicting one.

## Benefits Beyond Speed: Future-Proofing Your Storybook

While the primary benefit of Storybook Addon SWC is its speed, it also offers other advantages:

*   **Modern Tooling:** SWC is a modern compiler written in Rust, providing a robust and well-maintained foundation for your Storybook build process.
