# How to Check for Windows Errors Using Command Prompt (CMD): A Comprehensive Guide

The Command Prompt (CMD) in Windows is a powerful tool that allows you to interact directly with your operating system. While it might seem intimidating at first, CMD offers several utilities to help you identify and resolve errors within your Windows environment. This comprehensive guide will walk you through various techniques to check for Windows errors using CMD, providing you with the knowledge and tools to troubleshoot system issues effectively.

## Why Use Command Prompt for Error Checking?

While Windows provides graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for many tasks, CMD offers several advantages for error checking:

*   **Direct Access:** CMD allows you to directly access and manipulate system files and settings.
*   **Detailed Information:** Command-line tools often provide more verbose and detailed information about errors than GUI tools.
*   **Automation:** CMD commands can be scripted, allowing you to automate error checking and repair tasks.
*   **Recovery in Severe Cases:** In situations where the GUI is inaccessible due to critical errors, CMD might be the only way to diagnose and repair your system.

## Essential CMD Commands for Error Checking

Here are some of the most important CMD commands for checking and fixing Windows errors:

### 1. System File Checker (SFC)

The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in Windows utility that scans for and restores corrupted system files.  This is often the first step you should take when troubleshooting Windows errors.

**How to Use SFC:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**  Search for "cmd" in the Windows search bar, right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator."  Administrator privileges are required to use SFC effectively.

2.  **Run the SFC Command:** Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```cmd
    sfc /scannow
    ```

3.  **Wait for the Scan to Complete:** The scan process can take a significant amount of time (15-60 minutes), depending on the size of your system drive and the extent of the corruption.  Do not interrupt the process.

4.  **Review the Results:** After the scan is complete, SFC will display a message indicating whether any integrity violations were found and if they were successfully repaired.

    *   **"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."**  This means SFC found no corrupted system files.
    *   **"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them."**  SFC found and fixed corrupted files. You may want to reboot your computer.
    *   **"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log."**  SFC found corrupted files but could not fix them all.  You'll need to examine the `CBS.log` file to identify the problematic files.  You may need to use DISM (described below) or manually replace the corrupted files from a known good source.

**Example:**

```cmd
C:\WINDOWS\system32> sfc /scannow

Beginning system scan.  This process will take some time.

Beginning verification phase of system scan.
Verification 100% complete.

Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.
For online repairs, details are included in CBS log file located at
windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For offline
repairs, details are included in CBS log file located at
windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.
```

### 2. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)

The Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool is used to repair the Windows image. This is especially important if SFC is unable to repair corrupted files because the underlying Windows image itself might be damaged. DISM can use Windows Update to download and replace corrupted files.

**How to Use DISM:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:** As with SFC, you need to run CMD as an administrator.

2.  **Run the DISM CheckHealth Command:** This command checks if the image has been flagged as corrupted. It's a quick initial check.

    ```cmd
    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
    ```

3.  **Run the DISM ScanHealth Command:** This performs a more thorough scan to detect corruption.

    ```cmd
    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
    ```

4.  **Run the DISM RestoreHealth Command:**  This command attempts to automatically repair the Windows image using Windows Update.

    ```cmd
    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
    ```

5.  **Wait for the Process to Complete:**  Like SFC, the DISM process can take a considerable amount of time, particularly the `RestoreHealth` command. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

6.  **Rerun SFC:** After running DISM and restoring the image, rerun the `sfc /scannow` command to ensure that any files that DISM fixed are also properly repaired by SFC.

**Example:**

```cmd
C:\WINDOWS\system32> DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.19041.1

Image Version: 10.0.19041.1

[==========================100.0%==========================] The restore operation completed successfully.
The operation completed successfully.
```

### 3. Check Disk (CHKDSK)

CHKDSK (Check Disk) is a command-line utility that checks the integrity of your hard drive(s) and attempts to fix file system errors, bad sectors, and other disk-related issues.

**How to Use CHKDSK:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:** Run CMD as administrator.

2.  **Run the CHKDSK Command:**  To scan and repair the C: drive, use the following command:

    ```cmd
    chkdsk C: /f /r
    ```

    *   `/f`:  Fixes errors on the disk.
    *   `/r`:  Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information.

3.  **Schedule a Scan on Reboot (if necessary):**  If the C: drive is in use, CHKDSK will prompt you to schedule a scan on the next system reboot. Type `Y` and press Enter to schedule the scan.

4.  **Reboot Your Computer:**  If you scheduled a scan on reboot, restart your computer. CHKDSK will run before Windows starts.

5.  **Review the Results:** After the scan is complete, Windows will start normally.  You can view the CHKDSK results in the Event Viewer (see below).

**Important Notes about CHKDSK:**

*   **Running CHKDSK on an SSD:**  While CHKDSK can be run on SSDs, the `/r` parameter (bad sector recovery) is not as relevant for SSDs as it is for traditional hard drives.
*   **Data Loss:**  While CHKDSK attempts to recover data, there is a risk of data loss, especially if the disk has severe errors. It's always a good idea to back up your important data before running CHKDSK.

**Example:**

```cmd
C:\WINDOWS\system32> chkdsk C: /f /r
The type of the file system is NTFS.
Cannot lock current drive.

Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another
process.  Would you like to schedule this volume to be
checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N) y

This volume will be checked the next time the system restarts.
```

### 4. Event Viewer

The Event Viewer is a tool that logs system events, including errors, warnings, and informational messages.  It's a valuable resource for identifying the root cause of Windows problems.  While not a CMD command, accessing and interpreting the Event Viewer logs helps diagnose problems identified by other CMD tools.

**How to Access and Use Event Viewer:**

1.  **Open Event Viewer:** Search for "Event Viewer" in the Windows search bar and open it.

2.  **Navigate to Windows Logs:**  In the left pane, expand "Windows Logs."

3.  **Check Application, Security, and System Logs:**  Review the "Application," "Security," and "System" logs for errors and warnings.

4.  **Filter by Event Level:**  To focus on errors, filter the logs by "Error" level. You can also filter by "Warning" to investigate potential issues.

5.  **Examine Event Details:**  When you find an error or warning, double-click it to view its details.  The details will provide information about the event, including the source, event ID, description, and any associated data.

6.  **Search for Event IDs:**  If you see an event ID that you don't recognize, search online for more information about that specific event ID. This can often provide clues about the cause of the error and potential solutions.

**Example:**

Let's say you see a "System" log error with Event ID 7036 and Source "Service Control Manager."  A quick online search for "Event ID 7036 Service Control Manager" reveals that this error typically indicates a problem with a specific service failing to start or stop.  This helps you narrow down the possible causes of the issue.

### 5. Using `net statistics` to Check Network Errors

While not a comprehensive network diagnostic tool, `net statistics` can provide basic information about network traffic and potential errors.

**How to Use `net statistics`:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:** Open CMD as administrator.

2.  **Run the `net statistics` command for the workstation or server service:**

    *   **Workstation:** `net statistics workstation`
    *   **Server:** `net statistics server` (Only if your machine is acting as a server)

3.  **Analyze the Output:**  Look for lines related to errors, such as "Errors Received," "Bytes Received With CRC Errors," "Sessions Timed Out," etc. Elevated values in these areas might indicate network problems.

**Example:**

```cmd
C:\WINDOWS\system32> net statistics workstation

Workstation Statistics for \\MY-PC

        Statistics since 10/27/2024 10:00:00 AM

        Bytes received                           123456789
        SMB's received                           12345
        Bytes transmitted                        987654321
        SMB's transmitted                        54321
        Read operations                            1234
        Write operations                           5678
        Raw reads denied                           0
        Raw writes denied                          0
        Network errors                             0
        Connections made                           100
        Reconnects                                 5
        Server disconnects                         2

The command completed successfully.
```

In this example, "Network errors" is 0, which is good.  If this value was significantly higher than expected, it could indicate network adapter problems, cable issues, or other network-related errors.

## Best Practices for Error Checking with CMD

*   **Always Run CMD as Administrator:** Many CMD commands require administrator privileges to function correctly.
*   **Back Up Your Data:** Before running any potentially destructive commands like CHKDSK, back up your important data to prevent data loss.
*   **Document Your Steps:** Keep a record of the commands you run and the results you obtain. This will help you track your progress and avoid repeating steps.
*   **Research Error Messages:**  When you encounter an error message, search online for more information about it. This can provide valuable clues about the cause of the error and potential solutions.
*   **Be Patient:** Error checking and repair can take time. Allow the commands to complete without interruption.
*   **Start Simple:** Begin with the least invasive commands, like SFC and DISM, before moving on to more aggressive tools like CHKDSK.
*   **Consider Hardware Diagnostics:** If you suspect a hardware problem, consider running hardware diagnostics tools provided by your computer manufacturer.
