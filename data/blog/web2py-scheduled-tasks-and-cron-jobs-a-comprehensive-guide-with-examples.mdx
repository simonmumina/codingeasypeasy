# Web2py Scheduled Tasks & Cron Jobs: A Comprehensive Guide

Web2py is a powerful Python web framework that simplifies web application development. A crucial aspect of many web applications is the ability to perform tasks automatically and periodically â€“ often referred to as scheduled tasks or cron jobs. These tasks can handle various background processes, from sending scheduled emails and generating reports to cleaning up databases and updating data caches.

This guide will walk you through how to create and manage scheduled tasks within Web2py, providing you with the knowledge and examples you need to automate your application's background processes effectively.

## Why Use Scheduled Tasks?

Scheduled tasks offer numerous benefits for web applications, including:

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks, freeing up resources and reducing manual effort.
- **Efficiency:** Run resource-intensive operations in the background without impacting user experience.
- **Regularity:** Ensure tasks are executed consistently and on schedule.
- **Timeliness:** Perform time-sensitive operations, such as sending reminders or updating data at specific times.

## Web2py's Scheduler: The Core Component

Web2py includes a built-in scheduler module that allows you to define and manage scheduled tasks. This module provides a simple and intuitive way to execute Python functions at specified intervals.

### Enabling the Scheduler

Before you can start using the scheduler, you need to enable it within your Web2py application. This is done in the `models/db.py` file (or similar database configuration file) of your application. Add the following code:

```plaintext
from gluon.scheduler import Scheduler

scheduler = Scheduler(db) # 'db' is your database connection object
```

This code initializes the `Scheduler` object, linking it to your database. Web2py will use the database to store information about scheduled tasks and their execution history.

### Defining Tasks

To define a scheduled task, you'll create a Python function that performs the desired operation and then register it with the scheduler.

**Example: Sending a Daily Email**

Let's create a simple example that sends a daily email:

```plaintext
# controllers/tasks.py
def send_daily_email():
    mail.send(
        to=['user@example.com'],
        subject='Daily Report',
        message='This is your daily report. Have a great day!'
    )
    return 'Email sent successfully'
```

This function `send_daily_email()` uses Web2py's built-in `mail` object to send an email. Make sure you have configured your mail settings correctly in the `models/db.py` file.

### Registering Tasks with the Scheduler

Now, let's register this function with the scheduler in the `models/db.py` file:

```plaintext
# models/db.py
from gluon.scheduler import Scheduler

db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite') # Your database connection

# Enable mail server settings (replace with your own)
mail = Mail()
mail.settings.server = 'smtp.gmail.com:587'  # Replace with your SMTP server
mail.settings.sender = 'your_email@gmail.com' # Replace with your sender email
mail.settings.login = 'your_email@gmail.com:your_password' # Replace with your email and password
mail.settings.tls = True

auth = Auth(db)
auth.define_tables()

scheduler = Scheduler(db, mail=mail) # 'db' is your database connection object and include mail
scheduler.task('send_daily_email',
               interval=86400, # Seconds in a day
               start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
               repeats=0, # 0 means run forever
               func=send_daily_email) # Reference to the function
```

Let's break down this code:

- `scheduler = Scheduler(db, mail=mail)`: We initialize the `Scheduler` object, passing both the database connection `db` and the `mail` object for sending emails.
- `scheduler.task('send_daily_email', ...)`: This registers a new task with the scheduler. Let's look at the arguments:
  - `'send_daily_email'`: A unique name for the task. This is important for managing and identifying tasks later.
  - `interval=86400`: The interval between task executions, in seconds. `86400` seconds is equivalent to one day.
  - `start_time=datetime.datetime.now()`: The time when the task should first be executed. Here, we're setting it to the current time. `datetime` needs to be imported using `import datetime`.
  - `repeats=0`: The number of times the task should be repeated. `0` means the task will repeat indefinitely. You can set a positive integer to limit the number of repetitions.
  - `func=send_daily_email`: The function to be executed when the task is run. We pass a direct reference to the `send_daily_email` function defined in `controllers/tasks.py`.

**Important:** Ensure you import the `datetime` module using `import datetime` at the top of your `models/db.py` file. Also, ensure that the `send_daily_email` function is accessible by the `models/db.py` file, likely by importing it.

### Accessing the Scheduler Admin Interface

Web2py provides a built-in admin interface to monitor and manage your scheduled tasks. You can access it by navigating to:

`/appadmin/manage/your_app/scheduler`

Replace `your_app` with the name of your Web2py application. This interface allows you to:

- View the status of scheduled tasks.
- Start, stop, and delete tasks.
- Examine the execution history of tasks.
- Manually trigger tasks.

### Alternative Approaches for defining the func

- **lambda functions:** You can use lambda functions for simple tasks, especially when you want to pass arguments to the function. For example:

  ```plaintext
  # models/db.py
  def my_function(argument1, argument2):
      print(argument1, argument2)

  scheduler.task('my_task',
                 interval=60,
                 start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
                 repeats=0,
                 func=lambda: my_function('hello', 'world'))
  ```

- **String Names of Function:** This is suitable if you need to register a function that might not be readily importable into `models/db.py`. This however requires the function to be accessible globally.

  ```plaintext
  # models/db.py
  # Assuming my_function is globally accessible
  scheduler.task('my_task',
                 interval=60,
                 start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
                 repeats=0,
                 func='my_function') # Pass function name as a string
  ```

## Advanced Scheduling Options

The `scheduler.task()` method offers several advanced options to customize your scheduled tasks.

### `timeout`

The `timeout` parameter specifies the maximum execution time for a task, in seconds. If a task exceeds this time, it will be terminated. This is important to prevent runaway tasks from consuming excessive resources.

```plaintext
scheduler.task('long_running_task',
               interval=3600,
               start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
               repeats=0,
               func=long_running_function,
               timeout=300) # Timeout after 5 minutes
```

### `prevent_drift`

Setting `prevent_drift=True` will help ensure that tasks run at precisely scheduled times, even if previous executions took longer than expected. This is especially useful for time-critical tasks.

```plaintext
scheduler.task('time_sensitive_task',
               interval=60,
               start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
               repeats=0,
               func=time_sensitive_function,
               prevent_drift=True)
```

### `immediate`

If `immediate=True`, the task will be executed immediately when the scheduler is initialized (or when the application starts) in addition to its scheduled executions.

```plaintext
scheduler.task('startup_task',
               interval=3600,
               start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
               repeats=0,
               func=startup_function,
               immediate=True)
```

### `retry_failed`

If a task fails (raises an exception), setting `retry_failed=True` will automatically retry the task after a delay. You can control the delay with the `retry_failed_after` parameter (in seconds).

```plaintext
scheduler.task('important_task',
               interval=600,
               start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
               repeats=0,
               func=important_function,
               retry_failed=True,
               retry_failed_after=300) # Retry after 5 minutes
```

## Handling Task Failures

It's crucial to handle task failures gracefully to prevent disruptions in your application. The scheduler provides mechanisms for logging errors and retrying failed tasks.

### Logging Errors

The scheduler automatically logs any exceptions raised during task execution. You can access these logs through the scheduler admin interface.

### Retrying Failed Tasks (as seen earlier)

As mentioned above, using the `retry_failed` and `retry_failed_after` parameters, you can automatically retry failed tasks. This is useful for tasks that might fail due to temporary network issues or resource constraints.

### Implementing Error Handling Within Tasks

For more granular control, you can implement error handling directly within your task functions:

```plaintext
def data_processing_task():
    try:
        # Your data processing logic here
        result = process_data()
        # Store the result
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error
        db.error_log.insert(message=str(e), task_name='data_processing_task')
        db.commit()
        # Potentially raise the exception to trigger retry_failed (if enabled)
        raise
    return 'Data processed successfully'
```

In this example, we use a `try...except` block to catch any exceptions that occur during data processing. We then log the error to a database table (assuming you have a table named `error_log`) and potentially re-raise the exception to trigger the scheduler's `retry_failed` mechanism.

## Common Use Cases for Scheduled Tasks

Here are some common use cases for scheduled tasks in Web2py applications:

- **Sending Scheduled Emails:** Sending newsletters, reminders, or daily/weekly reports.
- **Data Processing:** Performing batch data processing, importing data from external sources, or generating data summaries.
- **Database Maintenance:** Cleaning up old data, optimizing database tables, or creating backups.
- **Cache Management:** Updating caches to improve application performance.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitoring system resources and sending alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## Example: Cleaning Up Old Log Entries

Let's create an example that cleans up old log entries from a database table:

```plaintext
# models/db.py (define the error_log table if you haven't already)
db.define_table('error_log',
    Field('message', 'text'),
    Field('task_name')
)
```

```plaintext
# controllers/tasks.py
import datetime

def cleanup_log_entries():
    cutoff_date = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=30) # Keep logs for 30 days
    db(db.error_log.created_on < cutoff_date).delete()  # Assuming you have a created_on field
    db.commit()
    return 'Log entries cleaned up successfully'
```

```plaintext
# models/db.py (register the task)
scheduler.task('cleanup_log_entries',
               interval=86400, # Run daily
               start_time=datetime.datetime.now(),
               repeats=0,
               func=cleanup_log_entries)
```

This code defines a task that runs daily and deletes any log entries older than 30 days from the `error_log` table.

## Important Considerations

- **Task Naming:** Choose meaningful and unique names for your tasks to make them easier to manage and identify.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within your task functions to prevent disruptions and ensure data integrity.
- **Resource Usage:** Be mindful of the resource usage of your scheduled tasks, especially for long-running or resource-intensive operations.
- **Security:** Secure your scheduled tasks to prevent unauthorized execution.
- **Database Interactions:** Handle database connections and transactions carefully within your tasks to avoid data corruption. Use `db.commit()` appropriately.
- **Time Zones:** Consider time zones when scheduling tasks, especially if your application serves users in multiple time zones. Web2py generally stores datetimes as UTC, so convert times accordingly when running calculations.
