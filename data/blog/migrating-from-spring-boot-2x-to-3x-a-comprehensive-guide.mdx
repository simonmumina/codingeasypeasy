# Migrating from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.x: A Comprehensive Guide

Spring Boot 3.x represents a significant leap forward in the Spring ecosystem. It's built on Spring Framework 6 and requires Java 17 as a minimum version. While the upgrade brings substantial benefits like improved performance, enhanced security, and alignment with the latest Jakarta EE specifications, the migration process requires careful planning and execution. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to migrating your Spring Boot 2.x application to 3.x, ensuring a smooth and successful transition.

## Why Migrate to Spring Boot 3.x?

Before diving into the how-to, let's explore the compelling reasons to upgrade:

- **Java 17 and Beyond:** Spring Boot 3.x leverages the power of Java 17 (and later versions), offering performance enhancements, new language features, and security improvements.
- **Jakarta EE 9 and 10 Support:** One of the most significant changes is the move from `javax` to `jakarta` namespaces. This aligns Spring Boot with the latest Jakarta EE specifications.
- **Spring Framework 6:** Under the hood, Spring Boot 3.x is built on Spring Framework 6, which brings performance improvements, observability enhancements, and a more streamlined architecture.
- **Performance Improvements:** The move to Java 17, Spring Framework 6, and optimized dependency versions contribute to significant performance gains in your application.
- **Security Enhancements:** Spring Boot 3.x incorporates the latest security best practices and mitigations, strengthening your application against vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Upgrades:** You'll benefit from the latest versions of all the underlying dependencies, including Hibernate, Tomcat, and others, bringing bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following in place:

- **Java 17 or Later:** Spring Boot 3.x requires Java 17 or a later version. Install a compatible JDK and configure your IDE and build tool (Maven or Gradle) to use it.
- **Spring Boot 2.7.x:** It's _highly_ recommended to migrate to the latest 2.7.x version before upgrading to 3.x. This simplifies the process and ensures compatibility with the migration tooling.
- **Backup Your Project:** Always create a backup of your project before making any significant changes.
- **Thorough Testing:** Have a robust suite of unit and integration tests to verify the correctness of your application after the migration.

## Step-by-Step Migration Guide

Here's a detailed walkthrough of the migration process:

### 1. Update to Spring Boot 2.7.x (if you're not already)

If your application is running on an older 2.x version (e.g., 2.6.x or 2.5.x), the first step is to upgrade to the latest 2.7.x release. This allows you to take advantage of deprecation warnings and migration aids provided by Spring.

**Maven:**

```plaintext
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.18</version> <!-- Use the latest 2.7.x version -->
    <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
</parent>
```

**Gradle (build.gradle.kts):**

```plaintext
dependencies {
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    // Other dependencies
}

dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies:2.7.18") // Use the latest 2.7.x version
    }
}
```

After updating to 2.7.x, run your application and pay close attention to deprecation warnings in the logs. Address these warnings as much as possible, as they indicate areas that will require changes in Spring Boot 3.x.

### 2. Update Dependencies

Update all your dependencies to their latest compatible versions. This includes Spring Data, Spring Security, and any other third-party libraries you are using. Consult the documentation for each dependency to ensure compatibility with Spring Boot 2.7.x. Fix any dependency conflicts that arise.

**Example (Maven):**

```plaintext
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
        <version>2.7.18</version> <!-- Match Spring Boot version -->
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
        <version>2.7.18</version> <!-- Match Spring Boot version -->
    </dependency>
    <!-- Other dependencies -->
</dependencies>
```

**Example (Gradle - build.gradle.kts):**

```plaintext
dependencies {
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa") {
        version {
            strictly("2.7.18") // Match Spring Boot version
        }
    }
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security") {
        version {
            strictly("2.7.18") // Match Spring Boot version
        }
    }
    // Other dependencies
}
```

Using strict versioning in Gradle ( `strictly("2.7.18")` ) helps avoid unintended transitive dependency updates that might cause problems.

### 3. Upgrade to Spring Boot 3.x

Now it's time to upgrade to Spring Boot 3.x.

**Maven:**

```plaintext
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version> <!-- Use the latest 3.x version -->
    <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository -->
</parent>
```

**Gradle (build.gradle.kts):**

```plaintext
dependencies {
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    // Other dependencies
}

dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies:3.2.0") // Use the latest 3.x version
    }
}
```

**Important:** After changing the Spring Boot version, refresh your project dependencies in your IDE or rebuild your project using Maven or Gradle.

### 4. Address Jakarta EE Namespace Changes

This is arguably the most significant change in Spring Boot 3.x. The `javax` packages have been replaced with `jakarta` packages. This impacts areas like:

- **Servlet API:** `javax.servlet.*` becomes `jakarta.servlet.*`
- **JPA:** `javax.persistence.*` becomes `jakarta.persistence.*`
- **Validation:** `javax.validation.*` becomes `jakarta.validation.*`
- **JAX-RS:** `javax.ws.rs.*` becomes `jakarta.ws.rs.*`

You'll need to update your imports throughout your codebase. While manual find and replace is possible, using your IDE's refactoring tools or a migration tool can significantly speed up the process.

**Example:**

**Before (Spring Boot 2.x):**

```plaintext
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

@Entity
public class MyEntity {
    // ...
}

public String getRequestPath(HttpServletRequest request) {
    // ...
}
```

**After (Spring Boot 3.x):**

```plaintext
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

@Entity
public class MyEntity {
    // ...
}

public String getRequestPath(HttpServletRequest request) {
    // ...
}
```

**Tips for Handling Jakarta EE Changes:**

- **IDE Refactoring:** Use your IDE's "Find and Replace" feature with regular expressions, or refactoring tools if they are available for Jakarta EE migration.
- **Spring Boot Migrator:** The Spring Boot team provides a migration tool that can automate many of these changes. See the "Migration Tooling" section below.

### 5. Update Configuration Properties

Some configuration properties have changed or been removed in Spring Boot 3.x. Review your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file and update any properties that are no longer valid or have a different name. Refer to the Spring Boot 3.x documentation for a complete list of configuration property changes.

**Example:**

The `server.servlet.context-path` property might need adjustment or replacement depending on your use case.

### 6. Review and Update Security Configuration

Spring Security has undergone significant changes. Review your security configuration and update it to be compatible with Spring Security 6. This may involve changes to:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Update your authentication and authorization mechanisms to align with the new APIs.
- **CSRF Protection:** Ensure your CSRF protection is properly configured.
- **Deprecated Security Features:** Replace any deprecated security features with their recommended alternatives.

**Example (simplified):**

**Before (Spring Boot 2.x):**

```plaintext
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .formLogin();
    }
}
```

**After (Spring Boot 3.x):**

```plaintext
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -> authz
                .requestMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .formLogin(withDefaults());
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

**Key Security Changes:**

- `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` is deprecated. Use component-based security configuration with `SecurityFilterChain` beans.
- Request matching has changed. Use `requestMatchers` instead of `antMatchers` or `mvcMatchers`.

### 7. Update Data Access Configuration

If you're using Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, or other data access technologies, review and update your configuration to ensure compatibility with Spring Boot 3.x. This may involve updating data source configuration, entity mappings, and repository interfaces. Pay close attention to changes in Hibernate versions.

### 8. Test Thoroughly

This is the most crucial step. Run your unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to verify that your application is functioning correctly after the migration. Pay particular attention to areas that were impacted by the Jakarta EE namespace changes or security configuration updates.

- **Unit Tests:** Ensure that your unit tests are passing and covering all critical functionalities.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the integration between different components of your application.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate real-world user scenarios to ensure that the application behaves as expected.

### 9. Address Compatibility Issues with Third-Party Libraries

After upgrading Spring Boot, you might encounter compatibility issues with third-party libraries. Carefully examine any error messages or unexpected behavior and consult the documentation for each library to find compatible versions or alternative solutions. Consider upgrading the libraries or finding alternatives that are compatible with Spring Boot 3.x.

### 10. Deploy and Monitor

After you've thoroughly tested your application, deploy it to a staging environment and monitor its performance and stability. Address any issues that arise in the staging environment before deploying to production. Continuously monitor your application in production to identify and resolve any issues that may arise after the upgrade.

## Migration Tooling

The Spring Boot team provides a migration tool to assist with the upgrade process. This tool can automate many of the common tasks, such as:

- Updating dependencies
- Migrating to Jakarta EE namespaces
- Updating configuration properties

You can find more information about the Spring Boot Migrator in the official Spring Boot documentation. This tool analyzes your project and suggests or automatically applies the necessary changes.

## Common Issues and Solutions

Here are some common issues you might encounter during the migration and how to resolve them:

- **ClassNotFoundException or NoClassDefFoundError:** This often indicates a missing dependency or a dependency version conflict. Check your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle.kts` file and ensure that all dependencies are present and compatible with Spring Boot 3.x.
- **Jakarta EE Namespace Issues:** Errors related to `javax` packages not found usually point to incomplete migration of imports to `jakarta` namespaces. Double-check your imports and use your IDE's refactoring tools to find and replace the incorrect imports.
- **Security Configuration Errors:** Errors in your security configuration can be tricky to debug. Carefully review the Spring Security 6 documentation and update your configuration accordingly. Use debug mode and examine the security filter chain to understand how requests are being handled.
- **Data Source Configuration Issues:** Errors connecting to your database often indicate misconfigured data source properties. Double-check your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file and ensure that the connection URL, username, and password are correct. Also, verify that the database driver is compatible with Spring Boot 3.x.
- **Bean Creation Errors:** These errors can occur due to dependency injection issues or configuration problems. Examine the error message closely and check your bean definitions and configuration files. Use the `@Primary` annotation to resolve conflicts where multiple beans of the same type are present.

## Conclusion

Migrating to Spring Boot 3.x requires careful planning and execution, but the benefits are well worth the effort. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure a smooth and successful transition and take advantage of the latest features and improvements in the Spring ecosystem. Remember to thoroughly test your application after the migration to ensure its stability and functionality. Good luck!
