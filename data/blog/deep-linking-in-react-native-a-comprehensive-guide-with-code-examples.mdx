# Deep Linking in React Native: A Comprehensive Guide with Code Examples

Deep linking is a powerful technique that allows you to navigate users directly to a specific section or feature within your React Native application from external sources like web pages, emails, or other apps. This creates a smoother and more engaging user experience, leading to increased app usage and retention. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of implementing deep linking in React Native, covering both iOS and Android platforms with practical code examples.

## What is Deep Linking and Why is it Important?

Imagine a user clicking on a link in an email that promotes a specific product in your e-commerce app. Without deep linking, the user might be taken to the app's home screen, requiring them to manually search for the product. With deep linking, the user is directly taken to the product page within your app, saving them time and effort.

Here's why deep linking is crucial:

- **Improved User Experience:** Directly navigates users to specific content, eliminating unnecessary steps.
- **Increased Engagement:** Makes it easier for users to access relevant information, leading to higher engagement.
- **Better Marketing Campaigns:** Enables targeted campaigns by directing users to specific promotions or features.
- **Simplified Sharing:** Allows users to share specific content within your app with others.

## Understanding Deep Linking Mechanisms

There are two primary types of deep linking:

- **URL Schemes (Custom URL Schemes):** These use custom URLs (e.g., `myapp://product/123`) to launch the app and pass data. While simple to implement, they are less reliable and can cause conflicts if multiple apps register the same scheme. They are also becoming deprecated.
- **Universal Links (iOS) / App Links (Android):** These use standard HTTP/HTTPS URLs and require verification by hosting a file on your domain to prove ownership. This is the recommended approach due to its security and reliability.

This guide will focus primarily on Universal Links and App Links as they are the standard and recommended method.

## Setting Up Deep Linking in React Native

Let's walk through the process of setting up deep linking in React Native for both iOS and Android. We'll use `react-native-linking` which is React Native's official module.

### 1. Install `react-native-linking`

If you haven't already, install the `react-native-linking` library:

```plaintext
npm install react-native-linking --save
# or
yarn add react-native-linking
```

For React Native versions < 0.60, you'll need to manually link the library:

```plaintext
react-native link react-native-linking
```

### 2. iOS Configuration (Universal Links)

**2.1 Associate Your App with Your Domain**

- **Register Your App ID:** Go to the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/) and create an App ID for your application, ensuring the "Associated Domains" capability is enabled.
- **Configure Your Associated Domains:** In your Xcode project:

  - Select your project in the Project navigator.
  - Click on your target.
  - Select the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
  - Click the "+ Capability" button.
  - Search for "Associated Domains" and add it.
  - Add your domain in the format `applinks:yourdomain.com`. If you have subdomains, you may need to specify them (e.g., `applinks:yourdomain.com`, `applinks:api.yourdomain.com`). The domain must be served over HTTPS.

  ```
  applinks:yourdomain.com
  ```

**2.2 Host Your `apple-app-site-association` File**

Create a file named `apple-app-site-association` (without any extension) and place it in the `.well-known` directory of your website's root. This file tells iOS that your app is associated with your domain.

```plaintext
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "YOUR_TEAM_ID.YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER",
        "paths": ["/product/*", "/blog/*", "/"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- Replace `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your Apple Team ID.
- Replace `YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` with your app's bundle identifier.
- The `paths` array specifies the URL paths that should be handled by your app. Using `["/"]` will handle all paths. More specific paths allow you to target specific sections of your app. You can use wildcards like `*` to match multiple segments.
- **Important:** Ensure your web server serves this file with the correct `Content-Type` header: `application/json`. Many servers will default to `text/plain` which will cause the link to fail.

**2.3 Update `AppDelegate.m` (or `AppDelegate.mm` if using Objective-C++)**

Add the following code to your `AppDelegate.m` file:

```objectivec
// AppDelegate.m

#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
   openURL:(NSURL *)url
   options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
  return [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
}

@end
```

If you are using the newer SceneDelegate structure, you will need to add the following to `SceneDelegate.m` as well:

```objectivec
// SceneDelegate.m

#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>

@implementation SceneDelegate

- (void)scene:(UIScene *)scene openURLContexts:(NSSet<UIOpenURLContext *> *)URLContexts {
  for (UIOpenURLContext *urlContext in URLContexts) {
    NSURL *url = urlContext.URL;
    [RCTLinkingManager application:[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url options:@{}];
  }
}

@end
```

**2.4 Handle the URL in Your React Native Code**

In your main React Native component (e.g., `App.js`), add the following code to handle the incoming URL:

```plaintext
// App.js

import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Linking } from 'react-native'

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleOpenURL = (event) => {
      console.log('Incoming URL:', event.url)
      // Navigate to the appropriate screen based on the URL
      // Example:
      const url = new URL(event.url)
      const path = url.pathname

      if (path.startsWith('/product/')) {
        const productId = path.split('/')[2] // Assuming the product ID is the third segment
        // Navigate to the product details screen with productId
        console.log('Navigating to product:', productId)
        // Replace with your navigation logic (e.g., using React Navigation)
      } else if (path.startsWith('/blog/')) {
        const blogId = path.split('/')[2]
        console.log('Navigating to blog', blogId)
      } else {
        // Handle other routes or the default case
        console.log('Navigating to default route')
      }
    }

    Linking.addEventListener('url', handleOpenURL)

    Linking.getInitialURL()
      .then((url) => {
        if (url) {
          console.log('Initial URL:', url)
          handleOpenURL({ url })
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => console.error('An error occurred', err))

    return () => {
      Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleOpenURL)
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    // Your app's UI
    <></>
  )
}

export default App
```

- `Linking.addEventListener('url', handleOpenURL)` listens for incoming URLs.
- `Linking.getInitialURL()` gets the URL that opened the app (if any) when the app was first launched.
- The `handleOpenURL` function parses the URL and navigates to the appropriate screen. This is a placeholder; you will need to integrate it with your app's navigation system (e.g., React Navigation).
- The cleanup function `Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleOpenURL)` is important to prevent memory leaks.

### 3. Android Configuration (App Links)

**3.1 Configure Your `AndroidManifest.xml`**

Open your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add an `intent-filter` to the main activity:

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|uiMode"
    android:launchMode="singleTask"  // Important for handling deep links correctly
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
    <intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data android:scheme="http" android:host="yourdomain.com" />
        <data android:scheme="https" android:host="yourdomain.com" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.
- The `android:autoVerify="true"` attribute tells Android to automatically verify your domain.
- The `android:launchMode="singleTask"` is very important. It ensures that the same activity is reused when the app is already running in the background. Without this, a new instance of your activity will be launched every time a deep link is opened.

**3.2 Host Your `assetlinks.json` File**

Create a file named `assetlinks.json` and place it in the `.well-known` directory of your website's root. This file tells Android that your app is associated with your domain.

```plaintext
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["YOUR_SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINT"]
    }
  }
]
```

- Replace `YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME` with your app's package name (e.g., `com.example.myapp`).
- Replace `YOUR_SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINT` with the SHA256 fingerprint of your app's signing certificate. You can obtain this fingerprint using the following command:

  ```plaintext
  keytool -list -v -keystore your_keystore.keystore -alias your_alias
  ```

  Replace `your_keystore.keystore` and `your_alias` with the path to your keystore file and the alias you used to sign your app, respectively. The output will contain the SHA256 fingerprint. Remove the colons (`:`) from the fingerprint.

- **Important:** Ensure your web server serves this file with the correct `Content-Type` header: `application/json`.

**3.3 Handle the URL in Your React Native Code**

Use the same code as for iOS in your `App.js` to handle the incoming URL:

```plaintext
// App.js

import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { Linking } from 'react-native'

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleOpenURL = (event) => {
      console.log('Incoming URL:', event.url)
      // Navigate to the appropriate screen based on the URL
      // Example:
      const url = new URL(event.url)
      const path = url.pathname

      if (path.startsWith('/product/')) {
        const productId = path.split('/')[2] // Assuming the product ID is the third segment
        // Navigate to the product details screen with productId
        console.log('Navigating to product:', productId)
        // Replace with your navigation logic (e.g., using React Navigation)
      } else if (path.startsWith('/blog/')) {
        const blogId = path.split('/')[2]
        console.log('Navigating to blog', blogId)
      } else {
        // Handle other routes or the default case
        console.log('Navigating to default route')
      }
    }

    Linking.addEventListener('url', handleOpenURL)

    Linking.getInitialURL()
      .then((url) => {
        if (url) {
          console.log('Initial URL:', url)
          handleOpenURL({ url })
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => console.error('An error occurred', err))

    return () => {
      Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleOpenURL)
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    // Your app's UI
    <></>
  )
}

export default App
```

### 4. Testing Deep Linking

**4.1 Testing on iOS**

- **Run your app on a real device.** Universal Links do not work reliably on simulators.
- **Open a link to your domain in Safari on the device.** For example, if your domain is `yourdomain.com` and you configured the `/product/*` path, open `https://yourdomain.com/product/123`.
- **Your app should launch and navigate to the appropriate screen.** If not, check the following:
  - Verify that the `apple-app-site-association` file is correctly hosted and has the correct `Content-Type` header.
  - Verify that you have correctly configured the Associated Domains capability in Xcode.
  - Check the device's console logs (using Xcode) for any errors related to Universal Links.
  - Make sure your device is connected to the internet to verify the `apple-app-site-association` file.

**4.2 Testing on Android**

- **Install your app on a real device or emulator.**
- **Use the following command to verify that your app links are correctly configured:**

  ```plaintext
  adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://yourdomain.com/product/123" your.package.name
  ```

  Replace `yourdomain.com/product/123` with your desired URL and `your.package.name` with your app's package name.

- **Check the output for the `Verify Success` message.** If the verification fails, check the following:

  - Verify that the `assetlinks.json` file is correctly hosted and has the correct `Content-Type` header.
  - Verify that the SHA256 fingerprint in the `assetlinks.json` file is correct.
  - Verify that you have correctly configured the `intent-filter` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
  - Run `adb logcat` to see any errors related to App Links.

- **Alternatively, open a link to your domain in Chrome on the device.** Your app should launch and navigate to the appropriate screen.

### 5. Using Custom URL Schemes (Less Recommended)

While Universal Links and App Links are the recommended approach, you can still use custom URL schemes for simpler scenarios or for compatibility with older systems.

**5.1 iOS Configuration (Custom URL Schemes)**

- **Add a URL Scheme to Your `Info.plist` File:**
  - In Xcode, open your `Info.plist` file.
  - Add a new key called `URL types`.
  - Under `URL types`, add a new item.
  - Under that item, add a key called `URL identifier` and set its value to a unique identifier for your app.
  - Add another key called `URL Schemes` and set its value to an array containing your custom URL scheme (e.g., `myapp`).

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.example.myapp</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>myapp</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

**5.2 Android Configuration (Custom URL Schemes)**

- **Add an `intent-filter` to Your `AndroidManifest.xml` File:**

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|uiMode"
    android:launchMode="singleTask"
    android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
        <data android:scheme="myapp" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

- Replace `myapp` with your custom URL scheme.

**5.3 Handling Custom URL Schemes in React Native**

Use the same React Native code as before to handle the incoming URL. The only difference is that the URL will start with your custom scheme (e.g., `myapp://product/123`).

### 6. Best Practices for Deep Linking

- **Use Universal Links / App Links whenever possible.** They are more secure and reliable than custom URL schemes.
- **Implement robust error handling.** Handle cases where the user doesn't have the app installed or the URL is invalid. You might redirect them to the app store or display an error message.
- **Use a consistent URL structure.** This makes it easier to parse URLs and navigate to the correct screens.
- **Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android.** Deep linking can be tricky, so it's essential to test your implementation carefully.
- **Consider using a deep linking service.** Services like Branch or AppsFlyer can simplify the implementation and provide additional features like attribution and analytics.
- **Handle deferred deep linking.** If a user clicks on a deep link _before_ installing your app, a deferred deep linking solution will persist the deep link information and automatically navigate the user to the correct content _after_ the app is installed. This requires a third-party service.

### 7. Integrating with React Navigation

If you're using React Navigation, you can easily integrate deep linking into your navigation configuration. Here's an example:

```plaintext
// App.js (using React Navigation v5/v6)

import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack'
import { Linking } from 'react-native'

import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen'
import ProductScreen from './screens/ProductScreen'
import BlogScreen from './screens/BlogScreen'

const Stack = createStackNavigator()

const linking = {
  prefixes: ['https://yourdomain.com', 'myapp://'], // Add your URL scheme here
  config: {
    screens: {
      Home: 'home',
      Product: {
        path: 'product/:productId',
        parse: {
          productId: (productId) => `${productId}`,
        },
      },
      Blog: {
        path: 'blog/:blogId',
        parse: {
          blogId: (blogId) => `${blogId}`,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer linking={linking} fallback={<Text>Loading...</Text>}>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Product" component={ProductScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Blog" component={BlogScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}

export default App
```

- `linking.prefixes` specifies the URL prefixes that should be handled by React Navigation.
- `linking.config.screens` defines the mapping between URL paths and screen names.
- The `path` property specifies the URL path for each screen.
- The `parse` property allows you to parse parameters from the URL.

Then, in your `ProductScreen` and `BlogScreen` components, you can access the `productId` and `blogId` parameters using the `route.params` object:

```plaintext
// ProductScreen.js

import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

const ProductScreen = ({ route }) => {
  const { productId } = route.params

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Product Details</Text>
      <Text>Product ID: {productId}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default ProductScreen
```

```plaintext
// BlogScreen.js

import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

const BlogScreen = ({ route }) => {
  const { blogId } = route.params

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Blog Details</Text>
      <Text>Blog ID: {blogId}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default BlogScreen
```

### Conclusion

Deep linking is a valuable tool for enhancing the user experience and increasing engagement in your React Native applications. By following this comprehensive guide, you can effectively implement deep linking for both iOS and Android platforms, using Universal Links/App Links for a robust and secure solution. Remember to test your implementation thoroughly and consider using a deep linking service for advanced features. Good luck!
