# Fixing 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token' in @react-navigation/ React Native Projects

Encountering a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error specifically within the `@react-navigation/*` packages in your React Native project can be incredibly frustrating. This error usually indicates a problem with how your JavaScript/TypeScript code is being transpiled or processed before being run on your device or emulator. It often stems from incorrect Babel configurations, Metro bundler setups, or issues related to TypeScript compilation. This comprehensive guide will walk you through common causes and provide solutions to get your React Navigation working flawlessly.

## Understanding the Error

The `SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error, when originating from a file within the `@react-navigation` directory, means the Metro bundler (React Native's default bundler) is encountering syntax it doesn't understand. This can happen for several reasons:

- **Incorrect Babel Configuration:** Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript (ES6+, TypeScript, etc.) into older, browser-compatible versions. If Babel isn't configured correctly, it might not be transpiling the modern JavaScript syntax used by `@react-navigation` properly.
- **Missing Babel Plugins/Presets:** Certain Babel plugins or presets are required to correctly transpile modern JavaScript features or TypeScript syntax. Missing plugins for features like JSX, decorators, or TypeScript can lead to this error.
- **Metro Bundler Misconfiguration:** Metro needs to be configured to use Babel correctly. If Metro isn't configured to use your Babel configuration file (`babel.config.js` or `.babelrc`), it might be using a default configuration that doesn't understand your code.
- **TypeScript Issues:** If you're using TypeScript, the error might be caused by incorrect TypeScript compilation settings or issues with TypeScript versions. Even if you're primarily using JavaScript, some of `@react-navigation`'s underlying code might be in TypeScript.
- **Conflicting Dependencies:** Rarely, but sometimes, different versions of Babel or other related dependencies might conflict, causing unexpected behavior.

## Diagnosing the Problem

Before diving into solutions, try to pinpoint the exact file and line number where the error occurs. This will help narrow down the potential cause. The error message usually includes the file path (e.g., `/xxx/@react-navigation/stack/src/index.tsx`) and the line number.

Here's a breakdown of common scenarios and their corresponding solutions:

## Solutions

Here's a structured approach to resolving the `SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error within your `@react-navigation` React Native project:

### 1. Verify Babel Configuration

This is the most common culprit. Ensure you have a `babel.config.js` (recommended) or `.babelrc` file in the root of your project.

- **Create a `babel.config.js` file (if one doesn't exist):**

  ```plaintext
  touch babel.config.js
  ```

- **Populate `babel.config.js` with a basic configuration:**

  ```javascript
  // babel.config.js
  module.exports = {
    presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  }
  ```

  This uses the `metro-react-native-babel-preset`, which is the standard preset for React Native projects and includes essential plugins for transpiling JSX and modern JavaScript.

- **Add necessary plugins (if you're using advanced features):**

  If you're using features like decorators (common in libraries like `mobx` or for advanced component styling), add the `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` plugin:

  ```plaintext
  npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators
  ```

  Then, update your `babel.config.js`:

  ```javascript
  // babel.config.js
  module.exports = {
    presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
    plugins: [
      ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', { legacy: true }], // Adjust 'legacy' based on your Babel version
    ],
  }
  ```

  **Important:** The `legacy: true` option for `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` is crucial for compatibility with older Babel versions and some React Native environments. If you're using a more recent Babel version (Babel 8 or later), you might need to adjust this configuration. Refer to the official Babel documentation for `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` for the latest guidance.

- **TypeScript Support (Crucial for `@react-navigation`):**

  Even if you're not writing TypeScript yourself, `@react-navigation` uses TypeScript internally, and Babel needs to be configured to handle it. Add the `@babel/preset-typescript` preset:

  ```plaintext
  npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript
  ```

  Then, update your `babel.config.js`:

  ```javascript
  // babel.config.js
  module.exports = {
    presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset', '@babel/preset-typescript'],
    plugins: [
      ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', { legacy: true }], // Adjust 'legacy' based on your Babel version
    ],
  }
  ```

  **Preset Order Matters:** The order of presets in the `presets` array can sometimes be important. Generally, `metro-react-native-babel-preset` should come first, followed by `@babel/preset-typescript`.

### 2. Verify Metro Bundler Configuration

Metro needs to be aware of your Babel configuration. While it usually picks up `babel.config.js` automatically, it's worth double-checking.

- **Check `metro.config.js` (if you have one):**

  If you have a `metro.config.js` file, ensure it's not overriding or interfering with the default Babel configuration. If you don't have one, you probably don't need one.

  A typical `metro.config.js` might look like this:

  ```javascript
  // metro.config.js
  const { getDefaultConfig } = require('metro-config')

  module.exports = (async () => {
    const {
      resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts },
    } = await getDefaultConfig()
    return {
      transformer: {
        babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('react-native-babel-transformer'),
        getTransformOptions: async () => ({
          transform: {
            experimentalImportSupport: false,
            inlineRequires: false,
          },
        }),
      },
      resolver: {
        assetExts: assetExts.filter((ext) => ext !== 'svg'), // Example: Filter out SVG if using react-native-svg-transformer
        sourceExts: [...sourceExts, 'jsx', 'js', 'ts', 'tsx', 'cjs'], // Ensure TypeScript and JSX extensions are included
      },
    }
  })()
  ```

  **Key Points:**

  - **`sourceExts`:** This array defines the file extensions that Metro should recognize as JavaScript/TypeScript source files. Ensure it includes `'ts'`, `'tsx'`, `'jsx'`, and `'js'`. Missing extensions can cause Metro to treat TypeScript files as plain text, leading to syntax errors.
  - **`babelTransformerPath`:** This specifies the Babel transformer. Usually, `react-native-babel-transformer` is the correct choice.
  - **`getTransformOptions`:** This allows you to configure the Babel transformer. The default options usually work well.

- **Clear Metro Cache:** Sometimes, Metro might be using a cached version of your code or configuration. Clearing the cache can force it to re-evaluate everything.

  ```plaintext
  npm start -- --reset-cache  # or yarn start --reset-cache
  ```

  This command tells Metro to clear its cache and rebuild the bundle from scratch.

### 3. TypeScript Configuration (If Using TypeScript)

If you are using TypeScript, check your `tsconfig.json` file for any potential issues.

- **`tsconfig.json`:** Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is correctly configured. A basic `tsconfig.json` might look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "esnext",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "jsx": "react-native",
      "lib": ["es2017"],
      "allowJs": true,
      "checkJs": false,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "moduleResolution": "node",
      "resolveJsonModule": true,
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "strict": true,
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "*": ["src/*"]
      }
    },
    "exclude": ["node_modules"]
  }
  ```

  **Key Points:**

  - **`target`:** `esnext` is a good starting point, allowing you to use the latest JavaScript features.
  - **`jsx`:** `react-native` tells the TypeScript compiler that you're using JSX for React Native components.
  - **`allowJs`:** Set to `true` if you want to allow TypeScript to compile JavaScript files alongside TypeScript files.
  - **`esModuleInterop`:** This option is crucial for interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules.
  - **`skipLibCheck`:** This option skips type checking of declaration files (`.d.ts`). While it can speed up compilation, it can also hide type errors in third-party libraries. Use with caution.

### 4. Dependency Conflicts

Rarely, dependency conflicts can cause issues. Try the following:

- **`npm install` or `yarn install`:** Make sure all your dependencies are installed correctly.

- **Check for conflicting versions:** Use `npm list` or `yarn list` to inspect your dependency tree and look for conflicting versions of Babel packages, React, or React Native. If you find conflicts, try resolving them by updating or downgrading dependencies.

- **Remove `node_modules` and reinstall:** This is a more drastic measure, but it can sometimes resolve dependency-related issues.

  ```plaintext
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install  # or yarn install
  ```

### 5. React Native Version

Ensure your React Native version is compatible with the version of `@react-navigation` you are using. Check the documentation for both libraries for compatibility information. Upgrading or downgrading React Native might be necessary.

### 6. Example Code Snippets and Common Mistakes

Let's look at some common mistakes and how to avoid them:

- **Incorrect Babel Configuration (Example):**

  ```javascript
  // BAD babel.config.js (Missing TypeScript Preset)
  module.exports = {
    presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  }
  ```

  This will cause errors with `@react-navigation` because it can't handle TypeScript code within the library.

- **Incorrect `metro.config.js` (Example):**

  ```javascript
  // BAD metro.config.js (Missing TypeScript Extension)
  const { getDefaultConfig } = require('metro-config')

  module.exports = (async () => {
    const {
      resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts },
    } = await getDefaultConfig()
    return {
      transformer: {
        babelTransformerPath: require.resolve('react-native-babel-transformer'),
        getTransformOptions: async () => ({
          transform: {
            experimentalImportSupport: false,
            inlineRequires: false,
          },
        }),
      },
      resolver: {
        assetExts: assetExts.filter((ext) => ext !== 'svg'),
        sourceExts: [...sourceExts, 'jsx', 'js', 'cjs'], // Missing 'ts' and 'tsx'
      },
    }
  })()
  ```

  This will prevent Metro from recognizing TypeScript files, leading to syntax errors.

### 7. Debugging Tips

- **Console Logging in Babel:** You can add `console.log` statements in your `babel.config.js` to inspect the Babel configuration that's being used. This can help you confirm that the correct presets and plugins are being loaded.

- **Verbose Metro Logging:** Run `npm start -- --verbose` (or `yarn start --verbose`) to get more detailed logging from Metro. This can help you identify any issues with Metro's configuration or dependency resolution.

## Conclusion

The `SyntaxError: Unexpected token` error in `@react-navigation` projects can be tricky, but by systematically checking your Babel and Metro configurations, TypeScript settings (if applicable), and dependencies, you can usually pinpoint and resolve the issue. Remember to clear your Metro cache after making any changes to your configuration files. Good luck, and happy navigating!
