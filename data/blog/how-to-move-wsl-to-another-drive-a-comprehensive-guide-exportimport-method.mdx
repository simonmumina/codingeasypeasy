# How to Move WSL to Another Drive: A Comprehensive Guide (Export/Import Method)

Running Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a fantastic way to leverage the power of Linux within your Windows environment. However, the default location for WSL distributions is typically on your system drive (usually C:), which can lead to space constraints, especially if you're using large Linux projects or databases.  Moving your WSL distribution to another drive can free up valuable space on your system drive and potentially improve performance if the new drive is faster. This guide will walk you through the process of moving your WSL distribution using the tried-and-true export/import method.

## Why Move Your WSL Distribution?

Before we dive into the how-to, let's quickly recap why you might want to move your WSL distribution:

*   **Free Up Space on Your System Drive:** This is the most common reason. WSL distributions, especially those with development tools and databases installed, can grow quite large.
*   **Improved Performance:** Moving your WSL distribution to a faster drive (e.g., an SSD) can significantly improve performance, especially for disk-intensive tasks.
*   **Organization:**  You might prefer to keep all your development-related files and environments on a dedicated drive for better organization.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed.** If you haven't already, you can install it by following the official Microsoft documentation.  Search for "Install WSL" on Microsoft's website.
*   **Administrator privileges on your Windows machine.** You'll need these to run the commands required to export and import the WSL distribution.
*   **Sufficient free space on the target drive.** Make sure you have enough space on the drive you're moving the WSL distribution to. A good rule of thumb is to have at least the same amount of free space as the current size of your WSL distribution.
*   **A command prompt or PowerShell window with administrator privileges.** This is where you'll be running the commands.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Exporting and Importing Your WSL Distribution

Here's a detailed walkthrough of the process:

### 1. Identify Your WSL Distribution Name

First, you need to know the exact name of the WSL distribution you want to move. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window with administrator privileges and run the following command:

```powershell
wsl -l -v
```

This command lists all installed WSL distributions and their status (version 1 or 2).  The output will look something like this:

```
  NAME            STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu          Stopped         2
  Debian          Stopped         2
```

In this example, the distribution name is `Ubuntu`.  Take note of the name, as you'll need it in the following steps.

### 2. Shut Down the WSL Distribution

Before you can export the distribution, you need to ensure it's shut down. Run the following command, replacing `<DistributionName>` with the actual name of your distribution:

```powershell
wsl --terminate <DistributionName>
```

For example, if you're moving Ubuntu, the command would be:

```powershell
wsl --terminate Ubuntu
```

You can verify that the distribution is terminated by running `wsl -l -v` again. The `STATE` should now be `Stopped`.  If it's still running, wait a few seconds and try the terminate command again.

### 3. Export the WSL Distribution to a `.tar` File

Now, you'll export the WSL distribution to a `.tar` file. This file will contain a complete image of your distribution. Choose a location on your **target drive** to save the `.tar` file.  It's crucial to store it on the new drive to avoid running out of space on your system drive.

Run the following command, replacing `<DistributionName>` with your distribution's name and `<TargetPath>` with the full path to where you want to save the `.tar` file (including the filename):

```powershell
wsl --export <DistributionName> "<TargetPath>\<DistributionName>.tar"
```

For example, if you want to export Ubuntu to `D:\WSL\Ubuntu.tar`, the command would be:

```powershell
wsl --export Ubuntu "D:\WSL\Ubuntu.tar"
```

This process might take some time, depending on the size of your WSL distribution. The command prompt will show a progress indicator.

### 4. Unregister the WSL Distribution

Once the export is complete, you need to unregister the existing WSL distribution. This will remove it from your system.  **Important: This will delete all the data in your current WSL distribution. Ensure you have a backup before proceeding!**

Run the following command, replacing `<DistributionName>` with your distribution's name:

```powershell
wsl --unregister <DistributionName>
```

For example:

```powershell
wsl --unregister Ubuntu
```

### 5. Create a New Directory for Your WSL Distribution

Now, create a new directory on your target drive where you want to store the files for your WSL distribution.  This is where the extracted contents of the `.tar` file will reside.  Choose a location that's easy to remember and access.

For example, you might create a directory called `D:\WSL\Ubuntu`.  You can create this directory using the Windows File Explorer or the command prompt using the `mkdir` command:

```powershell
mkdir D:\WSL\Ubuntu
```

### 6. Import the WSL Distribution

Now you can import the WSL distribution from the `.tar` file into the new directory you created.  Run the following command, replacing `<DistributionName>` with your distribution's name, `<InstallLocation>` with the full path to the new directory, and `<TargetPath>` with the full path to the `.tar` file:

```powershell
wsl --import <DistributionName> "<InstallLocation>" "<TargetPath>\<DistributionName>.tar"
```

For example, if you're importing Ubuntu into `D:\WSL\Ubuntu` from `D:\WSL\Ubuntu.tar`, the command would be:

```powershell
wsl --import Ubuntu "D:\WSL\Ubuntu" "D:\WSL\Ubuntu.tar"
```

This process will extract the contents of the `.tar` file into the specified directory.  Like the export process, this might take some time.

### 7. Start Your Imported WSL Distribution

After the import is complete, you can start your WSL distribution by running the following command:

```powershell
wsl -d <DistributionName>
```

For example:

```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
```

This will open a terminal window within your WSL distribution.

### 8. Verify the Location and Set the Default User (Optional)

Once inside your WSL distribution, verify that the files are indeed located on the new drive. You can use the `df -h` command to check the disk space usage. Look for the mount point `/` (root directory), which should now point to your new location (e.g., `D:\WSL\Ubuntu`).

If you want to set the default user for your WSL distribution (which is highly recommended), you'll need to find your user name first.  Inside your WSL terminal, type `whoami` to find it.  Then, run the following command from PowerShell (as Administrator), replacing `<DistributionName>` with your distribution's name and `<Username>` with your WSL username:

```powershell
ubuntu config --default-user <Username>
```

For example, if your username is `john`, the command would be:

```powershell
ubuntu config --default-user john
```

*Note: Replace `ubuntu` with the appropriate command for your distribution if it is not Ubuntu. For example, if you are using Debian the command will be `debian config --default-user <Username>`*

### 9. Clean Up (Optional)

Once you've verified that everything is working correctly, you can delete the `.tar` file to free up space.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

*   **"WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x8007019e" or other errors during import:** This usually indicates that the installation location already exists or that the user running the command doesn't have sufficient permissions. Ensure the installation location is empty and that you're running the command prompt or PowerShell as an administrator.
*   **Slow export/import speeds:** This can be due to a slow hard drive or a large WSL distribution. Try exporting/importing to a faster drive or reduce the size of your WSL distribution by removing unnecessary files and packages.
*   **WSL distribution not starting after import:** Double-check the distribution name you're using in the `wsl -d <DistributionName>` command. Also, ensure that the installation directory contains all the necessary files.

## Conclusion

Moving your WSL distribution to another drive using the export/import method is a straightforward way to manage your disk space and potentially improve performance. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly relocate your WSL environment without losing any data. Remember to back up your data before starting, and always run the commands with administrator privileges for the best results. Happy coding!
