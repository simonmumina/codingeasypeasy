# SQL PIVOT and UNPIVOT: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Data transformation is a crucial aspect of data analysis and reporting.  SQL provides powerful operators like `PIVOT` and `UNPIVOT` to reshape data for more insightful analysis. These operators can significantly improve readability and accessibility of data, making it easier to understand patterns and trends.  This comprehensive guide will explore the `PIVOT` and `UNPIVOT` operations in SQL, providing detailed explanations and practical code examples.

## What is PIVOT in SQL?

The `PIVOT` operator transforms rows into columns.  Think of it like taking a table where each row represents a specific observation and transforming it so that different values of a particular column become individual columns in the output.  This allows you to aggregate data across different categories more effectively.

**Key Components of the PIVOT Operator:**

*   **Source Table/Query:** The original data from which you want to pivot.
*   **Aggregation Function:**  A function like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, or `COUNT` used to aggregate the data. Since multiple rows might be combined into a single column after pivoting, an aggregation function is essential.
*   **Pivot Column:** The column whose distinct values will become the new column names in the output.
*   **Value Column:** The column whose values will be aggregated and populated into the new pivoted columns.
*   **FOR Column:** Specifies the column to be used for pivoting (the `Pivot Column` mentioned above).
*   **IN Clause:** Specifies the distinct values of the pivot column that will become the new column names.

**Syntax of the PIVOT Operator:**

```sql
SELECT <non-pivoted column(s)>,
       [first pivoted column],
       [second pivoted column],
       ...
       [last pivoted column]
FROM
(
    SELECT <non-pivoted column(s)>,
           <pivot column>,
           <value column>
    FROM <source table>
    WHERE <optional condition>
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT
(
    <aggregation function>(<value column>)
    FOR <pivot column>
    IN ( [first pivoted column], [second pivoted column], ..., [last pivoted column] )
) AS PivotTable;
```

**Example: Sales Data Pivot**

Let's imagine we have a table called `Sales` with the following structure and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    Region VARCHAR(50),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    SalesAmount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO Sales (Region, Category, SalesAmount) VALUES
('North', 'Electronics', 1500.00),
('North', 'Clothing', 800.00),
('South', 'Electronics', 1200.00),
('South', 'Clothing', 900.00),
('East', 'Electronics', 1000.00),
('East', 'Clothing', 700.00),
('West', 'Electronics', 1100.00),
('West', 'Clothing', 850.00);

SELECT * FROM Sales;
```

This table stores sales data for different regions and categories. We want to transform this data to display the sales amounts for each category as separate columns, with regions as rows.  Here's how we can use the `PIVOT` operator:

```sql
SELECT Region, Electronics, Clothing
FROM
(
    SELECT Region, Category, SalesAmount
    FROM Sales
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT
(
    SUM(SalesAmount)
    FOR Category
    IN (Electronics, Clothing)
) AS PivotTable;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Inner Query:** `SELECT Region, Category, SalesAmount FROM Sales` selects the necessary columns from the `Sales` table.
2.  **PIVOT Clause:**
    *   `SUM(SalesAmount)`:  Aggregates the `SalesAmount` using the `SUM` function. This is necessary because multiple rows for the same region might have the same category and thus should be aggregated.
    *   `FOR Category`:  Specifies that the `Category` column is the pivot column.  Its distinct values will become the new column names.
    *   `IN (Electronics, Clothing)`:  Specifies the distinct values of the `Category` column (`Electronics` and `Clothing`) that will become the new column names in the pivoted table.  This ensures that only these categories are represented as columns.

**Result:**

| Region | Electronics | Clothing |
|---|---|---|
| East | 1000.00 | 700.00 |
| North | 1500.00 | 800.00 |
| South | 1200.00 | 900.00 |
| West | 1100.00 | 850.00 |

Now, the data is presented with regions as rows and electronics and clothing sales as separate columns, making it easier to compare sales performance across regions for each category.

**Dynamic PIVOT:**

In scenarios where the values you want to pivot on are unknown or change frequently, you can use dynamic SQL to generate the `PIVOT` query. This avoids the need to hardcode the values in the `IN` clause.

```sql
DECLARE @cols AS NVARCHAR(MAX),
    @query  AS NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @cols = STUFF((SELECT distinct ',' + QUOTENAME(Category)
            FROM Sales
            ORDER BY Category
            FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE
            ).value('.', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)')
        ,1,1,'')

SET @query = 'SELECT Region, ' + @cols + ' from
            (
                SELECT Region, Category, SalesAmount
                FROM Sales
           ) x
            PIVOT
            (
                 SUM(SalesAmount)
                FOR Category IN (' + @cols + ')
            ) p '

EXECUTE(@query);
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`@cols` Variable:** This variable dynamically builds a comma-separated string of the distinct values from the `Category` column, enclosed in square brackets using `QUOTENAME`. This string will be used in the `IN` clause of the `PIVOT` operator.
2.  **`@query` Variable:** This variable constructs the complete `PIVOT` query as a string, incorporating the dynamically generated column list (`@cols`).
3.  **`EXECUTE(@query)`:** This executes the dynamically generated SQL query.

## What is UNPIVOT in SQL?

The `UNPIVOT` operator performs the reverse of `PIVOT`. It transforms columns into rows. It's useful when you have data stored in a wide format (where different categories are represented as columns) and you need to normalize it into a taller format (where each row represents a single observation).

**Key Components of the UNPIVOT Operator:**

*   **Source Table/Query:** The table containing the columns you want to unpivot.
*   **Value Column:** The name of the new column that will contain the values from the unpivoted columns.
*   **Pivot Column:** The name of the new column that will contain the names of the unpivoted columns.
*   **FOR Column:** Specifies the name you want to give to the column that will hold the values (the `Value Column` mentioned above).
*   **IN Clause:** Specifies the columns that you want to unpivot.

**Syntax of the UNPIVOT Operator:**

```sql
SELECT <non-unpivoted column(s)>,
       <pivot column>,
       <value column>
FROM
(
    SELECT <non-unpivoted column(s)>,
           [first unpivoted column],
           [second unpivoted column],
           ...
           [last unpivoted column]
    FROM <source table>
    WHERE <optional condition>
) AS SourceTable
UNPIVOT
(
    <value column>
    FOR <pivot column>
    IN ( [first unpivoted column], [second unpivoted column], ..., [last unpivoted column] )
) AS UnpivotTable;
```

**Example: Unpivoting the Pivoted Sales Data**

Let's use the result from the previous `PIVOT` example as our source table:

| Region | Electronics | Clothing |
|---|---|---|
| East | 1000.00 | 700.00 |
| North | 1500.00 | 800.00 |
| South | 1200.00 | 900.00 |
| West | 1100.00 | 850.00 |

Now, let's use `UNPIVOT` to transform this data back to its original format:

```sql
SELECT Region, Category, SalesAmount
FROM
(
    SELECT Region, Electronics, Clothing
    FROM
    (
        SELECT Region, Electronics, Clothing
        FROM Sales -- Assuming Sales table holds the pivoted data as in previous example
        PIVOT
        (
            SUM(SalesAmount)
            FOR Category
            IN (Electronics, Clothing)
        ) AS PivotTable
    ) AS PivotedTable
) AS SourceTable
UNPIVOT
(
    SalesAmount
    FOR Category
    IN (Electronics, Clothing)
) AS UnpivotTable;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Inner Query (PivotedTable):** Recreates the pivoted table using the same `PIVOT` statement as before.  This is necessary because the example assumes we are starting from the original `Sales` table and need to first pivot the data before unpivoting it.  If you already have a table in the pivoted format, you can directly reference it here.
2.  **Outer Query (SourceTable):** Selects the columns from the pivoted table.
3.  **UNPIVOT Clause:**
    *   `SalesAmount`: Specifies that the values from the `Electronics` and `Clothing` columns will be placed into a new column named `SalesAmount`.
    *   `FOR Category`: Specifies that the names of the unpivoted columns (`Electronics` and `Clothing`) will be placed into a new column named `Category`.
    *   `IN (Electronics, Clothing)`: Specifies the columns (`Electronics` and `Clothing`) that will be unpivoted.

**Result:**

| Region | Category | SalesAmount |
|---|---|---|
| East | Electronics | 1000.00 |
| East | Clothing | 700.00 |
| North | Electronics | 1500.00 |
| North | Clothing | 800.00 |
| South | Electronics | 1200.00 |
| South | Clothing | 900.00 |
| West | Electronics | 1100.00 |
| West | Clothing | 850.00 |

This effectively reverses the `PIVOT` operation, returning the data to its original row-oriented format.

## Practical Applications of PIVOT and UNPIVOT

*   **Reporting:**  Transform data into a format suitable for generating reports, such as displaying sales by region and product category.
*   **Data Analysis:** Reshape data to facilitate data mining and statistical analysis.  For example, comparing customer behavior across different demographic segments.
*   **Data Loading:**  Prepare data for loading into a data warehouse or other data stores that require specific data formats. `UNPIVOT` can be used to convert data from a format suitable for user entry (e.g., a spreadsheet) to a normalized database format.
*   **Data Comparison:**  Make it easier to compare data across different dimensions.  For example, comparing website traffic across different marketing channels over time.
*   **EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) Model Normalization:** Convert data from an EAV model into a more relational structure using `PIVOT`.

## Considerations and Best Practices

*   **Performance:**  `PIVOT` and `UNPIVOT` can be resource-intensive, especially on large datasets. Consider indexing relevant columns and optimizing your queries. Analyze the query execution plan to identify potential bottlenecks.
*   **Data Types:** Ensure that the data types of the values being aggregated are compatible with the aggregation function used in the `PIVOT` operator.
*   **Null Values:** Handle null values appropriately.  `PIVOT` will generally treat null values as zero for numeric aggregation functions. You might need to use `ISNULL` or `COALESCE` to explicitly handle null values based on your specific requirements.
*   **Column Aliases:**  Use aliases to give meaningful names to the pivoted columns.  This improves readability and maintainability.
*   **Dynamic SQL:** When using dynamic SQL for `PIVOT`, be cautious about SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Properly sanitize user inputs before incorporating them into the dynamic query.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your `PIVOT` and `UNPIVOT` queries to ensure that they produce the expected results.  Use sample data and compare the output with your expected outcome.
