# CQRS with FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide to Command Query Responsibility Segregation

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a powerful architectural pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store. This separation can lead to significant benefits in terms of performance, scalability, and maintainability, especially in complex applications. This blog post will guide you through implementing CQRS using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

## What is CQRS?

CQRS is not a framework or library, but rather an architectural pattern. The core idea is to divide the application into two distinct parts:

- **Commands:** Handle write operations. They _change_ the state of the system. Examples include creating a user, updating a product, or deleting a record. Commands are typically named with verbs in the imperative form (e.g., `CreateUserCommand`).

- **Queries:** Handle read operations. They _read_ the state of the system without modifying it. Examples include fetching a user's profile, listing products, or retrieving order details. Queries are typically named with nouns (e.g., `GetUserByIdQuery`).

This separation allows you to optimize each side independently. For example, you might use a more performant read-optimized database for queries, while using a more transactional database for commands. You can also scale the read side independently of the write side, which is crucial for applications with a high read-to-write ratio.

## Why Use CQRS?

Here's a summary of the advantages of using CQRS:

- **Improved Performance:** Queries can be optimized specifically for read operations, potentially using different data models or even entirely different data stores.
- **Increased Scalability:** Read and write sides can be scaled independently to meet demand.
- **Enhanced Security:** You can enforce stricter security on commands, as they are the operations that modify data.
- **Simplified Domain Logic:** Separating read and write concerns can lead to cleaner and more focused domain models.
- **Auditing and Event Sourcing:** CQRS can be naturally combined with event sourcing, providing a complete audit trail of all changes to the system.
- **Flexibility:** CQRS allows for using different technologies for read and write operations. You can choose the best tool for each job.

## Implementing CQRS with FastAPI: A Practical Example

Let's build a simplified example of a product management API using FastAPI and CQRS. We'll focus on the core principles and provide enough code to illustrate the pattern.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Uvicorn (for running the application)

Install the necessary packages:

```plaintext
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

**1. Data Models (Pydantic):**

First, define our data models using Pydantic. These models will represent the data structures for both commands and queries.

```plaintext
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class Product(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float

class CreateProductCommand(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float

class UpdateProductCommand(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: Optional[str] = None  # Optional fields for partial updates
    description: Optional[str] = None
    price: Optional[float] = None

class GetProductByIdQuery(BaseModel):
    id: int
```

**2. Command Handlers:**

Command handlers are responsible for executing commands and modifying the system's state. They encapsulate the business logic associated with each command.

```plaintext
from typing import Dict

# In-memory "database" for demonstration purposes
products: Dict[int, Product] = {}
next_product_id: int = 1

def create_product_handler(command: CreateProductCommand) -> Product:
    global next_product_id
    new_product = Product(id=next_product_id, **command.dict())
    products[next_product_id] = new_product
    next_product_id += 1
    return new_product

def update_product_handler(command: UpdateProductCommand) -> Optional[Product]:
    product_id = command.id
    if product_id not in products:
        return None

    existing_product = products[product_id]

    # Update only the provided fields
    if command.name is not None:
        existing_product.name = command.name
    if command.description is not None:
        existing_product.description = command.description
    if command.price is not None:
        existing_product.price = command.price

    products[product_id] = existing_product # Update the in-memory db
    return existing_product

def delete_product_handler(product_id: int) -> bool:
  if product_id in products:
    del products[product_id]
    return True
  return False
```

**3. Query Handlers:**

Query handlers are responsible for retrieving data from the system without modifying it. They are optimized for read performance.

```plaintext
def get_product_by_id_handler(query: GetProductByIdQuery) -> Optional[Product]:
    product_id = query.id
    return products.get(product_id)


def list_products_handler() -> list[Product]:
    return list(products.values())

```

**4. FastAPI Endpoints:**

Now, let's create the FastAPI endpoints that will expose our commands and queries through HTTP.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/products/", response_model=Product, status_code=201)  # Create product
async def create_product(command: CreateProductCommand):
    product = create_product_handler(command)
    return product

@app.put("/products/{product_id}", response_model=Product)  # Update product
async def update_product(product_id: int, command: UpdateProductCommand):
    command.id = product_id # Ensure the ID is set from the path
    updated_product = update_product_handler(command)
    if updated_product is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not found")
    return updated_product

@app.delete("/products/{product_id}", status_code=204)
async def delete_product(product_id: int):
  success = delete_product_handler(product_id)
  if not success:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not found")
  return

@app.get("/products/{product_id}", response_model=Product)  # Get product by ID
async def get_product(product_id: int):
    query = GetProductByIdQuery(id=product_id)
    product = get_product_by_id_handler(query)
    if product is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not found")
    return product

@app.get("/products/", response_model=List[Product])  # List all products
async def list_products():
    return list_products_handler()
```

**5. Running the Application:**

To run the FastAPI application, use Uvicorn:

```plaintext
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

(Assuming you saved the code as `main.py`)

You can now access the API endpoints through your browser or using a tool like `curl` or `Postman`.

**Example Usage:**

- **Create a Product (POST /products/):**

  ```plaintext
  {
    "name": "Example Product",
    "description": "This is an example product.",
    "price": 29.99
  }
  ```

- **Get a Product (GET /products/1):**
  (Assuming product with ID 1 exists)

- **Update a Product (PUT /products/1):**

  ```plaintext
  {
    "price": 39.99
  }
  ```

  This would update the product with ID 1 and change only the price

- **List Products (GET /products/):**

- **Delete a Product (DELETE /products/1):**

## Benefits in this Example:

While this is a simplified example using an in-memory database, it showcases the core principles of CQRS.

- **Clear Separation:** The `create_product_handler`, `update_product_handler` and `delete_product_handler` handle commands, while `get_product_by_id_handler` and `list_products_handler` handle queries. This clear separation makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.
- **Testability:** Command and query handlers can be tested independently.

## Taking it Further: Real-World Considerations

This example is a starting point. In a real-world application, you'll need to consider the following:

- **Database Integration:** Connect to a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB). You might choose to use different databases for the read and write sides.
- **Message Bus/Event Bus:** Implement a message bus (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple commands and queries further. This allows for asynchronous processing of commands and eventual consistency between the read and write sides.
- **Event Sourcing:** Consider using event sourcing as the persistence mechanism for the write side. This provides a complete audit trail of all changes to the system.
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Use DTOs to transfer data between layers of the application, further isolating the domain model.
- **Idempotency:** Ensure that command handlers are idempotent, meaning that executing the same command multiple times has the same effect as executing it once. This is important for handling failures and retries in a distributed system.
- **Validation:** Implement thorough validation of commands to ensure data integrity.

## Eventual Consistency

When using CQRS, particularly with separate data stores, you'll often deal with eventual consistency. This means that changes made by commands might not be immediately reflected in the read side. You need to design your application to handle this. Strategies include:

- **Using a message bus to propagate changes:** Command handlers publish events to the message bus, and query handlers subscribe to these events to update their read models.
- **Implementing retry mechanisms:** If a query returns stale data, the application can retry the query after a short delay.
- **Communicating the possibility of stale data to the user:** Inform the user that the data might not be completely up-to-date.

## Conclusion

CQRS is a powerful architectural pattern that can significantly improve the performance, scalability, and maintainability of your FastAPI applications. While it adds complexity, the benefits can outweigh the costs, especially in complex and demanding systems. By understanding the core principles of CQRS and implementing it thoughtfully, you can build more robust and scalable APIs with FastAPI. Remember to consider eventual consistency and carefully choose the right technologies for your specific needs.
