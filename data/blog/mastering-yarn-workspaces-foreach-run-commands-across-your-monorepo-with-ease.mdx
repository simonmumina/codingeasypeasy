# Mastering Yarn Workspaces `foreach`: Run Commands Across Your Monorepo with Ease

Yarn Workspaces have revolutionized how we manage large JavaScript projects, particularly monorepos. A key aspect of leveraging workspaces effectively is the `yarn workspaces foreach` command. This powerful tool allows you to execute commands across all or a subset of your workspaces, automating tasks and significantly improving your development workflow. This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of `yarn workspaces foreach`, complete with practical examples and best practices.

## What are Yarn Workspaces?

Before diving into `foreach`, let's quickly recap what Yarn Workspaces are. They are a feature of Yarn that enables you to manage multiple packages within a single repository (a monorepo). This approach offers several advantages:

- **Code Reusability:** Share code and components easily across different packages.
- **Dependency Management:** Centralized dependency management ensures consistency and avoids duplication.
- **Atomic Changes:** Make changes that span multiple packages in a single commit.
- **Simplified Testing:** Test all packages together, ensuring compatibility and integration.

To use Yarn Workspaces, you need to configure your `package.json` file in the root of your monorepo to include a `workspaces` field. For example:

```plaintext
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "prettier": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Yarn to treat any directory under `packages/` as a separate workspace.

## Introducing `yarn workspaces foreach`

`yarn workspaces foreach` is the command that unlocks the true potential of Yarn Workspaces. It allows you to execute arbitrary shell commands in each workspace. This is incredibly useful for tasks like:

- Running tests
- Linting and formatting code
- Building packages
- Publishing packages

The basic syntax is:

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach <command> [options]
```

Let's break down the key components:

- `yarn workspaces foreach`: This is the core command.
- `<command>`: This is the shell command you want to execute in each workspace. You can use any valid shell command.
- `[options]`: These are optional flags that modify the behavior of the command. We'll explore these in detail later.

## Basic Examples

Here are a few simple examples to illustrate the power of `yarn workspaces foreach`:

**1. Running Tests in All Workspaces:**

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach run test
```

This command will execute the `test` script defined in the `package.json` of each workspace.

**2. Linting Code in All Workspaces:**

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach run lint
```

This command will execute the `lint` script in each workspace, allowing you to easily identify and fix code style issues.

**3. Building Packages in All Workspaces:**

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach run build
```

This command will run the `build` script in each workspace, generating the distribution files for each package.

## Important Options and Flags

`yarn workspaces foreach` offers several options that give you fine-grained control over the command execution:

- **`-p, --parallel`:** Run the command in parallel across all workspaces. This can significantly speed up execution, especially for computationally intensive tasks. However, be mindful of potential resource contention.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach -p run build
  ```

- **`-t, --topological`:** Execute the command in topological order, ensuring that dependencies are built before their dependents. This is crucial for build processes where package A depends on package B.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach -t run build
  ```

- **`-tp, --topological-parallel`:** Combine topological ordering with parallel execution. This is often the most efficient approach for building complex monorepos. Yarn will build packages in topological order, but will build independent packages in parallel.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach -tp run build
  ```

- **`-i, --include <glob>`:** Specify a glob pattern to filter the workspaces that the command will be executed in. This is useful when you only want to run a command on a specific subset of your packages.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach -i "packages/ui-*" run build  // Only build packages that start with "ui-"
  ```

- **`-e, --exclude <glob>`:** Specify a glob pattern to exclude workspaces from the command execution. This is the opposite of `--include`.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach -e "packages/docs" run test // Run tests in all workspaces except the "docs" package.
  ```

- **`--since <ref>`:** Only run the command in workspaces that have changed since the given Git ref (e.g., a branch, tag, or commit). This is extremely helpful for CI/CD pipelines to only run tests on affected packages.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach --since main run test
  ```

- **`--no-private`:** Skip running the command in private packages (packages with `"private": true` in their `package.json`).

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach --no-private run publish
  ```

- **`--verbose`**: Displays more detailed output from each workspace. Helpful for debugging.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces foreach --verbose run build
  ```

## Advanced Examples and Best Practices

**1. Publishing Packages to npm:**

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach --no-private -t run publish --access public
```

This command will:

- `--no-private`: Skip private packages, as they shouldn't be published.
- `-t`: Build packages in topological order, ensuring dependencies are published before their dependents.
- `run publish`: Execute the `publish` script in each package.
- `--access public`: Publish the packages with public access.

**2. Cleaning `node_modules` Folders:**

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach run rimraf node_modules
```

This command uses `rimraf` (or `rm -rf` on Unix-like systems) to recursively delete the `node_modules` folder in each workspace. This is useful for cleaning up after dependency changes or for ensuring a clean build. Make sure you have `rimraf` installed (globally or as a dev dependency in the root `package.json`) before running this command.

**3. Setting Environment Variables:**

You can use environment variables with `yarn workspaces foreach` to customize the command execution based on the workspace. For example:

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach -p 'API_URL=$npm_package_name yarn run deploy'
```

In this example, `$npm_package_name` will be replaced with the name of the current package being processed.

**4. Using the `workspace.json` file**

Often, you need to configure each workspace slightly differently based on its function. Rather than passing huge command arguments, you can read a file from each workspace to drive execution.

Create a `workspace.json` file at the root like so:

```plaintext
{
  "dev": "vite --host --port $PORT",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview --host --port $PORT",
  "lint": "eslint . --ext .vue,.js,.jsx,.cjs,.mjs,.ts,.tsx,.cts,.mts --fix --ignore-path .gitignore",
  "format": "prettier --write ."
}
```

You can then use this to execute your commands within each workspace:

```plaintext
yarn workspaces foreach run dev # or build, lint etc
```

In each directory, the command `dev` will run `vite --host --port $PORT` after reading from `workspace.json`.

**Best Practices:**

- **Use Scripts:** Define common tasks in your `package.json` `scripts` section and then call those scripts using `yarn workspaces foreach run <script-name>`. This promotes code reuse and maintainability.

- **Start Small:** When you're first learning `yarn workspaces foreach`, start with simple commands and gradually increase the complexity as you become more comfortable.

- **Test Thoroughly:** Always test your commands thoroughly to ensure they are working as expected before running them on your entire monorepo.

- **Use `--verbose` for Debugging:** If you encounter issues, use the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed output from each workspace.

- **Consider `concurrently` or `npm-run-all`:** For more complex parallel execution scenarios, explore tools like `concurrently` or `npm-run-all`. These tools offer more advanced features for managing parallel processes.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Dependency Conflicts:** Ensure that your workspaces have consistent dependencies to avoid conflicts. Yarn's dependency resolution should help with this, but it's still important to be aware of.

- **Incorrect Glob Patterns:** Double-check your glob patterns when using `--include` or `--exclude` to ensure you are targeting the correct workspaces.

- **Resource Contention:** Running commands in parallel can sometimes lead to resource contention, especially if your workspaces have heavy dependencies or require a lot of CPU power. Experiment with different concurrency levels to find the optimal balance.

- **Not Using `-t` for Build Order**: Failing to use `-t` or `-tp` during build processes when dependencies exist can lead to broken builds as dependencies may not be available when a package attempts to use them.

## Conclusion

`yarn workspaces foreach` is a powerful and essential tool for managing monorepos with Yarn. By understanding its options and applying best practices, you can significantly streamline your development workflow, automate tasks, and improve the overall maintainability of your project. Embrace this command, experiment with different configurations, and unlock the full potential of Yarn Workspaces! Happy coding!
