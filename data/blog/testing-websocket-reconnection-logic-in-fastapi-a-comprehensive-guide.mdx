# Testing WebSocket Reconnection Logic in FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide

WebSockets provide real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server. In a world increasingly reliant on instant updates and interactive applications, ensuring the reliability of WebSocket connections is paramount. This post will guide you through testing WebSocket reconnection logic in FastAPI, a modern, high-performance Python web framework. We'll cover various strategies, from simulating connection drops to verifying reconnection attempts, along with practical code examples.

## Why Test WebSocket Reconnection Logic?

Network conditions are unpredictable. WebSocket connections can be disrupted due to various factors, including:

- **Network instability:** Wi-Fi fluctuations, mobile network switching, or temporary internet outages.
- **Server restarts:** Planned maintenance or unexpected server crashes.
- **Client-side errors:** Browser or application bugs that might close the connection.

Without robust reconnection logic, these disruptions can lead to a poor user experience, data loss, or application malfunction. Testing ensures your application gracefully handles these situations, maintains connection integrity, and minimizes disruption.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+:** FastAPI requires Python 3.7 or higher.
- **FastAPI:** `pip install fastapi`
- **Uvicorn:** An ASGI server to run FastAPI. `pip install uvicorn`
- **pytest:** A popular Python testing framework. `pip install pytest`
- **websockets:** The core WebSocket library for Python. `pip install websockets`
- **pytest-asyncio:** A pytest plugin for asynchronous tests. `pip install pytest-asyncio`
- **httpx:** An HTTP client that supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, useful for testing the initial HTTP connection before the WebSocket upgrade. `pip install httpx`

## Example FastAPI WebSocket Application

Let's start with a simple FastAPI application that implements a WebSocket endpoint with basic reconnection logic.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_connections: list[WebSocket] = []

    async def connect(self, websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.accept()
        self.active_connections.append(websocket)

    def disconnect(self, websocket: WebSocket):
        self.active_connections.remove(websocket)

    async def send_personal_message(self, message: str, websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.send_text(message)

    async def broadcast(self, message: str):
        for connection in self.active_connections:
            await connection.send_text(message)


manager = ConnectionManager()

@app.websocket("/ws/{client_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, client_id: int):
    await manager.connect(websocket)
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            await manager.send_personal_message(f"You wrote: {data}", websocket)
            await manager.broadcast(f"Client #{client_id} says: {data}")
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        manager.disconnect(websocket)
        await manager.broadcast(f"Client #{client_id} left the chat")

```

This code defines a simple WebSocket endpoint that echoes messages back to the client and broadcasts them to all connected clients. It also handles disconnections gracefully. Note, however, that it doesn't explicitly handle _reconnection_. The client will need to initiate the reconnection process.

## Testing Reconnection Scenarios

Here's where things get interesting. We need to simulate connection failures and verify that our client-side reconnection logic works as expected. We'll use `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` to write asynchronous tests.

### 1. Setting up a Test Client

First, let's create a reusable test client that handles the WebSocket connection and reconnection attempts. This example assumes the client automatically tries to reconnect if the connection is closed. The reconnection logic would typically be implemented in JavaScript in a real-world web application.

```plaintext
import pytest
import asyncio
from websockets import connect
import websockets
import json


class WebSocketTestClient:
    def __init__(self, url: str, client_id: int, max_retries: int = 3, retry_delay: float = 1):
        self.url = url
        self.client_id = client_id
        self.websocket = None
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.retry_delay = retry_delay
        self.received_messages = []
        self.is_connected = False

    async def connect(self):
        retries = 0
        while retries < self.max_retries:
            try:
                uri = f"{self.url}{self.client_id}"
                self.websocket = await connect(uri)
                self.is_connected = True
                print(f"Client {self.client_id}: Connected successfully.")
                return True
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Client {self.client_id}: Connection failed (attempt {retries + 1}/{self.max_retries}): {e}")
                retries += 1
                await asyncio.sleep(self.retry_delay)

        print(f"Client {self.client_id}: Failed to connect after {self.max_retries} retries.")
        self.is_connected = False
        return False

    async def send(self, message: str):
        if self.websocket and not self.websocket.closed:
            await self.websocket.send(message)
        else:
            print(f"Client {self.client_id}: Cannot send message. Not connected.")

    async def receive(self):
        try:
            if self.websocket:
                message = await self.websocket.recv()
                self.received_messages.append(message)
                return message
            else:
                return None
        except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError:
            print(f"Client {self.client_id}: Connection closed.")
            self.is_connected = False
            return None
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Client {self.client_id}: Receive error: {e}")
            return None

    async def close(self):
        if self.websocket:
            await self.websocket.close()
            self.is_connected = False
        print(f"Client {self.client_id}: Connection closed.")
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  #Give it a little time to close

    def get_received_messages(self):
        return self.received_messages

    def is_connection_open(self):
       return self.websocket is not None and not self.websocket.closed

```

This `WebSocketTestClient` class encapsulates the logic for connecting to a WebSocket endpoint, sending and receiving messages, and handling disconnections with automatic retries. The crucial part is the `connect()` method which retries connecting based on configured `max_retries` and `retry_delay`. It also tracks connection status.

### 2. Base Fixture for Testing

To streamline our tests, we can create a pytest fixture that starts and stops the FastAPI application. This also gives us the base URL for our WebSocket endpoint.

```plaintext
import pytest
import uvicorn
import asyncio
from multiprocessing import Process
from httpx import AsyncClient  # Import AsyncClient

BASE_URL = "ws://localhost:8000/ws/"


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def event_loop():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    yield loop
    loop.close()


def run_app():
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="localhost", port=8000, log_level="info")


@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
async def app_process():
    proc = Process(target=run_app, daemon=True)
    proc.start()
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Give the app time to start
    yield
    proc.terminate()
    proc.join()

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
async def client():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://localhost:8000") as client:
        yield client
```

Key points:

- `event_loop`: A session-scoped fixture to manage the asyncio event loop.
- `app_process`: A session-scoped fixture that starts the FastAPI application in a separate process using `uvicorn`. This prevents blocking the test execution. The `daemon=True` ensures the process is killed when the test session ends. We also add a short `asyncio.sleep()` to give the app time to start before running tests. The fixture also terminates the process when the test session is completed.
- `client`: An `httpx` client for initial HTTP requests (if needed). While this example focuses on websockets, it's often useful to have an HTTP client for setting up initial conditions or verifying API behavior.
- `BASE_URL` : Defines the base URL for WebSocket connections in your tests.

**Important:** Ensure your main app file is named `main.py` (or adjust the `uvicorn.run` command accordingly) and that it contains the `app` instance from our example.

### 3. Testing a Simulated Server Restart

Now, let's create a test that simulates a server restart during a WebSocket connection. We'll connect a client, send a message, then abruptly kill the server process, simulating a crash. The client _should_ automatically reconnect and attempt to send another message.

```plaintext
import pytest
import asyncio
from websockets import connect
import websockets
from multiprocessing import Process
import uvicorn
from .main import app  # Import your FastAPI app
from .websocket_client import WebSocketTestClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_websocket_reconnection(app_process):  #Use the app_process fixture
    client_id = 1
    client = WebSocketTestClient(url="ws://localhost:8000/ws/", client_id=client_id)

    is_connected = await client.connect()
    assert is_connected, "Client failed to connect initially"
    assert client.is_connection_open(), "Client should be connected"


    await client.send("First message")
    response1 = await client.receive()
    assert response1 is not None, "First message should be received"

    # Simulate server restart
    print("Simulating Server Restart")
    for proc in app_process.process.children():
        proc.terminate()
        proc.join()

    app_process.terminate()
    app_process.join()


    # Start the app again
    new_app_process = Process(target=run_app, daemon=True)
    new_app_process.start()
    await asyncio.sleep(2) #Give it time to restart

    # Attempt to send another message after reconnection
    await client.send("Second message after restart")
    response2 = await client.receive()
    assert response2 is not None, "Second message should be received after restart"
    assert client.is_connection_open(), "Client should be reconnected"


    await client.close()
```

Explanation:

1.  **`@pytest.mark.asyncio`:** Marks the test as an asynchronous test for `pytest-asyncio`.
2.  **`client = WebSocketTestClient(...)`:** Creates an instance of our `WebSocketTestClient` with the correct WebSocket URL and client ID.
3.  **`await client.connect()`:** Connects the client to the WebSocket endpoint. The assertion verifies the connection was established successfully.
4.  **`await client.send(...)` & `await client.receive()`:** Sends a message and verifies the response. This ensures the initial connection is working.
5.  **Simulating Server Restart:** This is the core of the test. We terminate the Uvicorn process (simulating a server crash). We _then_ need to restart the process for the client to be able to reconnect. `app_process` is terminated and `run_app` is used to start it up again. We introduce `asyncio.sleep(2)` to ensure that the server is running again before we attempt reconnection and message sending.
6.  **Sending After Restart:** After simulating the restart, we attempt to send another message. The client's reconnection logic _should_ kick in, re-establish the connection, and successfully send the message. The assertions verify that the reconnection was successful and that the second message was delivered.
7.  **`await client.close()`:** Closes the WebSocket connection gracefully at the end of the test.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Graceful Termination:** The above example abruptly terminates the Uvicorn process. In a real-world scenario, you might want to simulate a more graceful shutdown, allowing the server to complete any pending operations. However, the abrupt termination better simulates an actual crash.
- **Client-Side Reconnection Logic:** This test relies on the client-side code implementing the reconnection logic. The `WebSocketTestClient` demonstrates a basic retry mechanism. You'll need to adapt the client to match your actual implementation.

### 4. Testing Network Disconnections

Another scenario is simulating a network disconnection without killing the server. This requires a bit more setup but can be achieved using tools like `iptables` (on Linux) to block traffic to the server's port. Since this is more platform-specific, I'll provide a conceptual outline:

1.  **Setup `iptables`:** Before the test, use `iptables` to block traffic to the server's port (8000 in this case). This effectively simulates a network outage for the client.
2.  **Run the Test:** Connect the client, send a message, and then block the traffic with `iptables`.
3.  **Verify Reconnection:** After blocking the traffic, attempt to send another message. The client should detect the disconnection and attempt to reconnect.
4.  **Remove `iptables` Rule:** After a suitable delay (to allow the client to attempt reconnection), remove the `iptables` rule to restore network connectivity.
5.  **Verify Message Delivery:** The client should eventually reconnect and deliver the message.

**Example (Conceptual using `subprocess` to interact with `iptables`):**

```plaintext
import subprocess
import pytest
import asyncio
from .websocket_client import WebSocketTestClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_network_disconnection(app_process):
    client_id = 1
    client = WebSocketTestClient(url="ws://localhost:8000/ws/", client_id=client_id)

    is_connected = await client.connect()
    assert is_connected, "Client failed to connect initially"

    await client.send("Initial message")
    response = await client.receive()
    assert response is not None

    # Block traffic to port 8000 (replace with your actual port)
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "iptables", "-A", "INPUT", "-p", "tcp", "--dport", "8000", "-j", "DROP"], check=True)
    print("Traffic blocked using iptables")

    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Give time for the connection to drop and client to try reconnect

    # Remove the iptables rule
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "iptables", "-D", "INPUT", "-p", "tcp", "--dport", "8000", "-j", "DROP"], check=True)
    print("Traffic unblocked using iptables")

    await asyncio.sleep(5) # Allow time for reconnection to happen

    # Send a message after reconnection
    await client.send("Message after reconnection")
    response2 = await client.receive()  # This should eventually succeed after reconnection
    assert response2 is not None, "Message should be received after reconnection"


    await client.close()
```

**Important:**

- This example requires `sudo` privileges to modify `iptables`. You might need to configure your test environment accordingly.
- The exact `iptables` commands might vary depending on your operating system and firewall configuration.
- This is a _simplified_ example. Error handling (e.g., checking if `iptables` is installed) and more robust cleanup are crucial in a production environment.

### 5. Mocking the WebSocket Connection

For simpler, more isolated tests, you can mock the WebSocket connection. This allows you to control the connection state and simulate different scenarios without relying on a real server. `unittest.mock` or a similar mocking library can be used for this.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```plaintext
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from .websocket_client import WebSocketTestClient


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_mocked_websocket_reconnection():
    client_id = 1
    client = WebSocketTestClient(url="ws://localhost:8000/ws/", client_id=client_id)

    mock_websocket = AsyncMock()
    mock_websocket.recv.side_effect = [
        "Initial message response",
        Exception("Simulated disconnection"),  # Simulate a disconnection
        "Reconnected message response",
    ]

    with patch("websockets.connect", return_value=mock_websocket):
        is_connected = await client.connect()
        assert is_connected

        await client.send("Initial message")
        response1 = await client.receive()
        assert response1 == "Initial message response"

        # The next receive() call should raise an exception, simulating a disconnection
        await client.send("Attempt to send after disconnection") #This message will be "lost" in this example

        #After reconnecting the receive should work again
        await client.send("Message after reconnection")
        response2 = await client.receive()
        assert response2 == "Reconnected message response"

        await client.close()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`mock_websocket = AsyncMock()`:** Creates an asynchronous mock object for the WebSocket connection.
2.  **`mock_websocket.recv.side_effect = [...]`:** Defines the behavior of the `recv()` method. The first call returns a normal response, the second raises an exception (simulating a disconnection), and the third returns another response after reconnection. This allows controlled simulation of failure scenarios.
3.  **`with patch("websockets.connect", return_value=mock_websocket):`:** Replaces the `websockets.connect` function with our mock object. This intercepts the connection attempt and returns the mock WebSocket instead of a real one.
4.  The rest of the test then proceeds as before, sending and receiving messages. The mock WebSocket's predefined behavior simulates the disconnection and subsequent reconnection.

**Advantages of Mocking:**

- **Isolation:** Mocking allows you to isolate the client-side reconnection logic and test it independently of the server.
- **Speed:** Mocked tests are generally much faster than integration tests that involve a real server.
- **Control:** You have complete control over the connection state and can easily simulate various error scenarios.

**Disadvantages of Mocking:**

- **Less Realistic:** Mocked tests are less realistic than integration tests. They don't test the entire system, including the server-side code and the network communication.
- **Maintenance:** Mocked tests can be more difficult to maintain if the actual WebSocket API changes.

## Best Practices for Testing WebSocket Reconnection

- **Test Different Scenarios:** Simulate various types of disconnections, including server crashes, network outages, and client-side errors.
- **Verify Reconnection Attempts:** Ensure the client attempts to reconnect after a disconnection, and that the reconnection attempts are made with appropriate delays.
- **Validate Message Delivery:** Verify that messages are delivered successfully after a reconnection.
- **Test with Multiple Clients:** Test the reconnection logic with multiple concurrent clients to ensure that the server can handle multiple reconnections gracefully.
- **Consider Using a Real Server in Some Tests:** While mocking is useful for isolated tests, include some integration tests with a real server to ensure the entire system works correctly.
- **Log and Monitor Reconnections:** Implement logging and monitoring to track reconnection events in your production environment. This can help you identify and diagnose issues related to WebSocket connectivity.

## Conclusion

Testing WebSocket reconnection logic is crucial for building robust and reliable real-time applications. By using FastAPI, `pytest`, and the techniques described in this guide, you can ensure that your WebSocket connections are resilient to network disruptions and server outages. Remember to test various scenarios, verify reconnection attempts, and validate message delivery to build a solid foundation for your real-time applications.
