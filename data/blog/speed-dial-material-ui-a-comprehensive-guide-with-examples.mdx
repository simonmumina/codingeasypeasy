# Speed Dial Material UI: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The Material UI (MUI) Speed Dial component is a floating action button (FAB) that displays a menu of actions when clicked. It's a fantastic way to provide quick access to commonly used features, improving user experience and streamlining workflows within your React applications. This guide will take you through everything you need to know to effectively use and customize the Speed Dial component.

## What is a Speed Dial?

A Speed Dial, also known as a radial menu or circular floating action button, provides a user interface pattern for initiating multiple actions from a single button. Instead of cluttering the UI with numerous buttons, the Speed Dial cleverly presents actions as a menu that expands when the primary button is activated. This makes it an ideal solution for mobile and web applications where space is limited and efficiency is paramount.

## Why Use Speed Dial in Material UI?

Material UI's Speed Dial component offers several advantages:

- **Clean and Efficient UI:** Conserves screen real estate by hiding actions until needed.
- **Improved User Experience:** Provides quick access to common tasks, reducing clicks and navigation.
- **Customizability:** Highly customizable, allowing you to tailor its appearance and behavior to fit your application's design.
- **Accessibility:** Built with accessibility in mind, ensuring a positive experience for all users.
- **MUI Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the rest of the Material UI component library, ensuring consistency and a unified look and feel.

## Getting Started with Material UI Speed Dial

First, make sure you have Material UI installed in your project. If not, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
# or
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

Next, import the necessary components from `@mui/material`:

```plaintext
import SpeedDial from '@mui/material/SpeedDial'
import SpeedDialIcon from '@mui/material/SpeedDialIcon'
import SpeedDialAction from '@mui/material/SpeedDialAction'
import FileCopyIcon from '@mui/icons-material/FileCopy'
import SaveIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Save'
import PrintIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Print'
import ShareIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Share'
import EditIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Edit'
```

### Basic Implementation

Here's a basic example of a Speed Dial with a few actions:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import SpeedDial from '@mui/material/SpeedDial'
import SpeedDialIcon from '@mui/material/SpeedDialIcon'
import SpeedDialAction from '@mui/material/SpeedDialAction'
import FileCopyIcon from '@mui/icons-material/FileCopy'
import SaveIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Save'
import PrintIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Print'
import ShareIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Share'

const actions = [
  { icon: <FileCopyIcon />, name: 'Copy' },
  { icon: <SaveIcon />, name: 'Save' },
  { icon: <PrintIcon />, name: 'Print' },
  { icon: <ShareIcon />, name: 'Share' },
]

function BasicSpeedDial() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false)
  const handleOpen = () => setOpen(true)
  const handleClose = () => setOpen(false)

  return (
    <SpeedDial
      ariaLabel="SpeedDial basic example"
      sx={{ position: 'absolute', bottom: 16, right: 16 }}
      icon={<SpeedDialIcon />}
      onClose={handleClose}
      onOpen={handleOpen}
      open={open}
    >
      {actions.map((action) => (
        <SpeedDialAction
          key={action.name}
          icon={action.icon}
          tooltipTitle={action.name}
          onClick={handleClose} // Add your action logic here
        />
      ))}
    </SpeedDial>
  )
}

export default BasicSpeedDial
```

**Explanation:**

- **`SpeedDial`:** The main component that wraps the entire Speed Dial functionality.
- **`SpeedDialIcon`:** The icon displayed on the primary button. You can customize this with any icon you desire.
- **`SpeedDialAction`:** Represents each individual action within the Speed Dial menu. It accepts an `icon` and a `tooltipTitle`.
- **`actions` array:** Holds the data for each action, making it easy to manage and iterate over.
- **`open` state:** Controls the visibility of the Speed Dial actions.
- **`handleOpen` and `handleClose`:** Functions to toggle the `open` state.
- **`sx` prop:** Used for applying custom styles. In this example, it positions the Speed Dial in the bottom right corner of the screen.
- **`onClick` on `SpeedDialAction`:** Crucially important! This is where you'll add the logic to execute when a user clicks on a specific action. Remember to close the Speed Dial after an action is performed for a smoother user experience.

### Customizing the Speed Dial

Material UI provides a variety of props to customize the Speed Dial's appearance and behavior.

#### Position

The `sx` prop allows you to control the position of the Speed Dial. You can use CSS properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to place it anywhere on the screen. The `position` property should typically be set to `absolute` or `fixed`.

```jsx
<SpeedDial
  sx={{ position: 'fixed', top: 16, left: 16 }}
  // ... other props
/>
```

#### Direction

The `direction` prop controls the direction in which the Speed Dial actions expand. Available options are:

- `up` (default)
- `down`
- `left`
- `right`

```jsx
<SpeedDial
  direction="down"
  // ... other props
/>
```

#### Animation

You can customize the animation of the Speed Dial using CSS transitions and the `sx` prop. For example, you can change the easing function or the duration of the animation. While MUI doesn't offer built-in animation props beyond what CSS `transition` provides, you can get creative!

#### Icons

You can use any Material UI icon or a custom SVG as the icon for both the main button and the actions.

```jsx
import AddIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Add'

function CustomIconSpeedDial() {
  // ... other code
  return (
    <SpeedDial
      ariaLabel="SpeedDial with custom icon"
      icon={<SpeedDialIcon openIcon={<AddIcon />} />}
      sx={{ position: 'absolute', bottom: 16, right: 16 }}
      // ... other props
    >
      {/* ... actions */}
    </SpeedDial>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `AddIcon` from `@mui/icons-material`.
- We pass an object to the `SpeedDialIcon` component. This object has an `openIcon` property, which we set to `<AddIcon />`. This allows us to use a different icon when the Speed Dial is open. Without the `openIcon` prop, the default icon will be rotated.

#### Tooltips

The `tooltipTitle` prop on the `SpeedDialAction` component displays a tooltip when the user hovers over the action.

#### Styling

You can use the `sx` prop or CSS classes to apply custom styles to the Speed Dial and its actions. Material UI's theming system makes it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout your application.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles'

const StyledSpeedDial = styled(SpeedDial)(({ theme }) => ({
  '& .MuiSpeedDial-fab': {
    backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.dark,
    '&:hover': {
      backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.main,
    },
  },
}))

function StyledSpeedDialComponent() {
  // ... other code
  return (
    <StyledSpeedDial
      ariaLabel="Styled SpeedDial"
      icon={<SpeedDialIcon />}
      sx={{ position: 'absolute', bottom: 16, right: 16 }}
      // ... other props
    >
      {/* ... actions */}
    </StyledSpeedDial>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We use `styled` from `@mui/material/styles` to create a styled version of the `SpeedDial` component.
- We target the `.MuiSpeedDial-fab` class, which represents the FAB (Floating Action Button) within the SpeedDial.
- We use the `theme` object to access the colors defined in our Material UI theme. This ensures that our custom styles are consistent with the rest of the application.
- We change the background color and hover background color of the FAB.

### Handling Actions

The most important part of using the Speed Dial is handling the actions when the user clicks on them. You can attach an `onClick` handler to each `SpeedDialAction` component.

```jsx
function ActionSpeedDial() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false)
  const handleOpen = () => setOpen(true)
  const handleClose = () => setOpen(false)

  const handleCopy = () => {
    console.log('Copy action triggered!')
    handleClose() // Close the Speed Dial after the action
  }

  const handleSave = () => {
    console.log('Save action triggered!')
    handleClose()
  }

  const actions = [
    { icon: <FileCopyIcon />, name: 'Copy', action: handleCopy },
    { icon: <SaveIcon />, name: 'Save', action: handleSave },
    { icon: <PrintIcon />, name: 'Print' }, // Example: No action defined for Print
    { icon: <ShareIcon />, name: 'Share' }, // Example: No action defined for Share
  ]

  return (
    <SpeedDial
      ariaLabel="Action SpeedDial"
      sx={{ position: 'absolute', bottom: 16, right: 16 }}
      icon={<SpeedDialIcon />}
      onClose={handleClose}
      onOpen={handleOpen}
      open={open}
    >
      {actions.map((action) => (
        <SpeedDialAction
          key={action.name}
          icon={action.icon}
          tooltipTitle={action.name}
          onClick={action.action || handleClose} // Use defined action or just close
        />
      ))}
    </SpeedDial>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We define separate handler functions for each action (e.g., `handleCopy`, `handleSave`).
- We add an `action` property to each item in the `actions` array, which holds the corresponding handler function.
- In the `SpeedDialAction` component, we set the `onClick` prop to `action.action`.
- For actions without explicitly defined handler functions (like 'Print' and 'Share' in the example), we're using `action.action || handleClose` to ensure the SpeedDial closes when clicked.

Remember to close the Speed Dial after an action is performed to provide a smooth user experience.

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is crucial for creating inclusive user interfaces. The Material UI Speed Dial component provides built-in accessibility features, but it's important to consider the following:

- **`aria-label`:** Provide a descriptive `aria-label` for the `SpeedDial` component to help screen reader users understand its purpose.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure users can navigate the Speed Dial using the keyboard. Material UI handles this mostly automatically, but test it thoroughly.
- **Focus Management:** When the Speed Dial is opened, focus should be automatically moved to the first action. When the Speed Dial is closed, focus should return to the main button. This is generally handled well by MUI, but double-check.
- **Tooltips:** Use tooltips (`tooltipTitle`) to provide additional context for each action, especially for users with cognitive disabilities.
- **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and background colors to make the Speed Dial readable for users with visual impairments. Use Material UI's theming to manage this.
- **Meaningful Icons:** Choose icons that are universally understood and clearly represent the actions they perform. Always supplement icons with text labels (tooltips).

## Best Practices

- **Use Sparingly:** Don't overuse Speed Dials. They're best suited for providing quick access to a small number of frequently used actions. If you have many actions, consider a different UI pattern.
- **Meaningful Actions:** The actions in the Speed Dial should be relevant to the current context and easily understood by the user.
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Ensure the Speed Dial is visually distinct from other elements on the page. Use appropriate colors, spacing, and positioning.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test the Speed Dial on different devices and browsers to ensure it works as expected. Pay close attention to accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Consider the User's Task Flow:** Think about the user's typical workflow and design the Speed Dial to support that workflow.

## Advanced Techniques

### Dynamic Actions

You can dynamically update the actions in the Speed Dial based on the current state of your application.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import SpeedDial from '@mui/material/SpeedDial'
import SpeedDialIcon from '@mui/material/SpeedDialIcon'
import SpeedDialAction from '@mui/material/SpeedDialAction'
import FileCopyIcon from '@mui/icons-material/FileCopy'
import SaveIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Save'
import DeleteIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Delete' // Added Delete Icon

function DynamicActionsSpeedDial() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const [canDelete, setCanDelete] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate a check to see if the item can be deleted
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCanDelete(true)
    }, 2000) // After 2 seconds, allow deletion
  }, [])

  const handleOpen = () => setOpen(true)
  const handleClose = () => setOpen(false)

  const handleDelete = () => {
    console.log('Item deleted!')
    setCanDelete(false) // Disable delete after it's clicked (for example)
    handleClose()
  }

  const actions = [
    { icon: <FileCopyIcon />, name: 'Copy' },
    { icon: <SaveIcon />, name: 'Save' },
    ...(canDelete ? [{ icon: <DeleteIcon />, name: 'Delete', action: handleDelete }] : []), // Conditionally add Delete
  ]

  return (
    <SpeedDial
      ariaLabel="SpeedDial with dynamic actions"
      sx={{ position: 'absolute', bottom: 16, right: 16 }}
      icon={<SpeedDialIcon />}
      onClose={handleClose}
      onOpen={handleOpen}
      open={open}
    >
      {actions.map((action) => (
        <SpeedDialAction
          key={action.name}
          icon={action.icon}
          tooltipTitle={action.name}
          onClick={action.action || handleClose}
        />
      ))}
    </SpeedDial>
  )
}

export default DynamicActionsSpeedDial
```

**Explanation:**

- We use the `canDelete` state variable to determine whether the "Delete" action should be included in the Speed Dial.
- The `useEffect` hook simulates a check that determines whether the item can be deleted (e.g., based on user permissions or the item's state).
- The spread operator (`...`) is used to conditionally add the "Delete" action to the `actions` array based on the value of `canDelete`. This prevents issues if action is undefined.

### Using a Render Prop for Actions

For more complex scenarios, you can use a render prop to control the rendering of the actions. This can be useful if you need to pass additional props to the actions or if you need to perform more complex logic before rendering them.

(This is a less common pattern with Material UI's SpeedDial, so an example isn't included here for brevity. The standard array mapping is usually sufficient.)

## Conclusion
