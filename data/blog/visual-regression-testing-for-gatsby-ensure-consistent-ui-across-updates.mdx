# Visual Regression Testing for Gatsby: Ensure Consistent UI Across Updates

Maintaining a consistent and visually appealing user interface is crucial for any website, especially those built with frameworks like Gatsby. With frequent updates and changes, it's easy for unintentional visual bugs to creep in. This is where visual regression testing comes to the rescue.

This guide will walk you through implementing visual regression testing for your Gatsby website, ensuring that your UI remains pixel-perfect across updates. We'll explore different tools and approaches, providing code examples to help you get started.

## What is Visual Regression Testing?

Visual regression testing (also known as visual testing) is a type of automated testing that compares screenshots of your application's UI before and after code changes. The tool highlights any visual differences between the "before" and "after" images, allowing you to quickly identify and address unintended UI regressions. Think of it as a digital pair of eyes, catching subtle visual changes that might be missed during manual testing.

## Why Visual Regression Testing for Gatsby?

- **Catch UI regressions early:** Prevent visual bugs from reaching production.
- **Automated testing:** Reduce the need for manual visual inspection, saving time and resources.
- **Increased confidence:** Ensure that code changes don't break the UI.
- **Improved collaboration:** Provide visual feedback to developers and designers.
- **Faster development cycles:** Catch and fix UI issues quickly, enabling faster iteration.
- **Gatsby Specific Benefits:** Gatsby's component-based architecture makes it a great fit for visual regression testing, allowing you to test individual components in isolation. With frequent plugin updates and framework changes, visual testing becomes crucial for stability.

## Tools for Visual Regression Testing with Gatsby

Several tools can be used for visual regression testing in Gatsby. Here are some popular options:

- **Storybook + Chromatic:** A popular combination. Storybook allows you to develop and test components in isolation. Chromatic, built by the Storybook team, provides a seamless visual testing workflow for Storybook components.
- **Percy:** A dedicated visual testing platform that integrates with various CI/CD systems. Percy specializes in capturing full-page snapshots and offers advanced features like cross-browser testing and responsive layout testing.
- **Cypress:** An end-to-end testing framework that can also be used for visual regression testing using plugins. Cypress provides a powerful and flexible testing environment for simulating user interactions and capturing screenshots.
- **Jest + Puppeteer/Playwright:** This is a more DIY approach, allowing you to use a standard JavaScript testing framework (Jest) along with a headless browser automation tool (Puppeteer or Playwright) to capture screenshots and compare them programmatically.

We'll focus primarily on Storybook + Chromatic and briefly touch on Cypress as alternative approaches.

## Option 1: Storybook + Chromatic

This is a recommended approach for Gatsby projects, especially if you're already using Storybook for component development.

### 1. Setting up Storybook

If you don't have Storybook set up already, you can quickly add it to your Gatsby project:

```plaintext
npx sb init
```

This will automatically detect your Gatsby project and configure Storybook accordingly.

### 2. Creating Stories

Create Storybook stories for the components you want to visually test. For example, let's say you have a `Button` component:

```jsx title="src/components/Button.js"
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
`

const Button = ({ children, onClick }) => {
  return <StyledButton onClick={onClick}>{children}</StyledButton>
}

export default Button
```

Create a corresponding Storybook story:

```jsx title="src/stories/Button.stories.js"
import React from 'react'
import Button from '../components/Button'

export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
}

const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />

export const Primary = Template.bind({})
Primary.args = {
  children: 'Click Me',
}

export const Secondary = Template.bind({})
Secondary.args = {
  children: 'Secondary Button',
  style: { backgroundColor: 'grey' }, // Example style override
}
```

### 3. Installing Chromatic

Install Chromatic as a dev dependency:

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev chromatic
```

### 4. Running Chromatic

Chromatic will guide you through setting up an account and connecting your project to their platform. Run the following command:

```plaintext
npx chromatic
```

This command will:

- Build your Storybook.
- Upload your Storybook to Chromatic.
- Create a baseline screenshot for each story.

### 5. Making Changes and Running Chromatic Again

Now, make some changes to your `Button` component (e.g., change the background color):

```jsx title="src/components/Button.js"
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: #0099ff; /* Changed background color */
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
`

const Button = ({ children, onClick }) => {
  return <StyledButton onClick={onClick}>{children}</StyledButton>
}

export default Button
```

Run Chromatic again:

```plaintext
npx chromatic
```

Chromatic will detect the visual changes and present them to you in their web interface. You can then review the changes and either approve them (if they are intentional) or reject them (if they are unintended bugs).

**Chromatic in CI/CD:**

Chromatic integrates seamlessly with CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions. Add a Chromatic step to your workflow to automatically run visual tests on every pull request. Chromatic provides snippets to easily add to your CI configuration. This ensures that any visual regressions are caught before they are merged into your main branch.

### 6. Chromatic Configuration

You can customize Chromatic's behavior using a `.chromatic` directory and files. For example, you can configure:

- **exitZeroOnChanges:** Whether to exit with a zero code if changes are found. Useful for preventing merges with visual regressions.
- **autoAcceptChanges:** Automatically accept changes (use with caution).
- **projectToken:** Your Chromatic project token.

Example `.chromatic/chromatic.config.js`:

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  exitZeroOnChanges: true,
}
```

## Option 2: Cypress for Visual Regression Testing

Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework that can be extended for visual regression testing. This approach allows you to test components in context and simulate user interactions.

### 1. Install Cypress

If you don't already have it, install Cypress:

```plaintext
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

### 2. Install Cypress Image Snapshot

Install the `cypress-image-snapshot` plugin:

```plaintext
npm install cypress-image-snapshot --save-dev
```

### 3. Configure Cypress

Add the following to your `cypress/support/e2e.js` file:

```plaintext
import 'cypress-image-snapshot/support'
```

Add the following to your `cypress/plugins/index.js` file (or `cypress.config.js` with Cypress 10+):

```plaintext
const { addMatchImageSnapshotPlugin } = require('cypress-image-snapshot/plugin')

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  addMatchImageSnapshotPlugin(on, config)
}

// Cypress 10+
// module.exports = defineConfig({
//   e2e: {
//     setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
//       addMatchImageSnapshotPlugin(on, config);
//     },
//   },
// });
```

### 4. Create a Cypress Test

Create a Cypress test file (e.g., `cypress/e2e/visual.cy.js`) to capture and compare screenshots:

```plaintext title="cypress/e2e/visual.cy.js"
describe('Visual Regression Test', () => {
  it('should match the button snapshot', () => {
    cy.visit('/') //  Visit your Gatsby site.  You'll need your site running locally.
    cy.get('button').should('be.visible') // Ensure the button is visible
    cy.get('button').matchImageSnapshot()
  })

  it('should match the entire page snapshot', () => {
    cy.visit('/')
    cy.document().matchImageSnapshot()
  })
})
```

**Important:** You'll need your Gatsby development server running (`gatsby develop`) before running Cypress tests. Adjust the `cy.visit()` URL accordingly.

### 5. Run Cypress Tests

Run Cypress:

```plaintext
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner. Run the `visual.cy.js` test. The first time you run the test, it will create a baseline screenshot. Subsequent runs will compare the current screenshot against the baseline. Any differences will cause the test to fail, and you can review the differences in the Cypress UI.

**Updating Baselines:**

To update the baseline screenshot (e.g., after intentional UI changes), you can use the `updateSnapshots` option:

```plaintext
npx cypress run --env updateSnapshots=true
```

Or, in your Cypress test, you can pass an options object to `matchImageSnapshot`:

```plaintext
cy.get('button').matchImageSnapshot({ updateSnapshot: true })
```

### Cypress Image Snapshot Configuration

`cypress-image-snapshot` offers various configuration options, such as:

- `failureThreshold`: The percentage of pixels that can be different before the test fails.
- `failureThresholdType`: The type of threshold to use (e.g., `percent`, `pixel`).
- `customDiffConfig`: Allows you to customize the image comparison algorithm.
- `threshold`: This is deprecated as of v4 of `cypress-image-snapshot`.

Example:

```plaintext
cy.get('button').matchImageSnapshot('button-snapshot', {
  failureThreshold: 0.05, // 5% threshold
  failureThresholdType: 'percent',
})
```

## Best Practices for Visual Regression Testing

- **Isolate components:** Test individual components in isolation to avoid cascading failures. Storybook is excellent for this.
- **Consistent environment:** Ensure a consistent testing environment (e.g., browser, viewport size) to minimize false positives. Use consistent settings in Cypress or Chromatic.
- **Ignore dynamic content:** Exclude dynamic content (e.g., dates, timestamps, animations) from screenshots. Chromatic and Percy offer features to mask regions of the screen. Cypress has methods to intercept and modify the server response.
- **Review changes carefully:** Don't blindly accept all visual changes. Carefully review each change to ensure it's intentional and correct.
- **Integrate with CI/CD:** Automate visual regression testing as part of your CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early.
- **Optimize screenshots:** Optimize screenshot sizes to improve performance.
- **Use descriptive names:** Use descriptive names for your screenshots and tests to make it easier to understand the results.

## Conclusion

Visual regression testing is an essential practice for maintaining a high-quality Gatsby website. By implementing visual tests with tools like Storybook + Chromatic or Cypress, you can catch UI regressions early, prevent visual bugs from reaching production, and ensure a consistent user experience across updates. Choose the approach that best fits your project's needs and enjoy the benefits of automated visual testing! Remember to configure your testing environment and tests appropriately to minimize false positives and maximize the effectiveness of your visual regression testing strategy. Happy testing!
