# How to Cache API Responses in Nuxt 3 for Improved Performance

In today's web development landscape, performance is paramount. Users expect lightning-fast loading times and seamless interactions. When building a Nuxt 3 application, frequently fetching data from APIs can become a significant bottleneck if not handled efficiently. Caching API responses is a crucial technique to mitigate this problem. By storing API data locally, you can reduce the number of requests to your server, leading to:

- **Reduced Server Load:** Less traffic to your API server translates to lower costs and improved stability.
- **Faster Loading Times:** Retrieving data from the cache is significantly faster than making a network request.
- **Improved User Experience:** A faster website leads to happier users and increased engagement.

This blog post will guide you through several effective strategies for caching API responses in your Nuxt 3 applications. We'll cover both client-side and server-side caching techniques, leveraging the power of VueUse's `useFetch` composable and Nuxt 3's serverless function capabilities.

## Understanding the Caching Landscape in Nuxt 3

Before diving into the code, it's important to understand the different caching strategies available:

- **Browser/Client-Side Caching:** Data is stored directly in the user's browser. This is the fastest option for subsequent requests but relies on the browser's cache management. We'll explore this using `useFetch`.
- **Server-Side Caching:** Data is cached on the server (e.g., in memory or a dedicated caching system like Redis). This is ideal for data that needs to be consistent across all users and can be pre-fetched. We'll demonstrate this within a Nuxt server route/API endpoint.

## Client-Side Caching with `useFetch` (VueUse)

The easiest and most straightforward way to cache API responses in Nuxt 3 is by utilizing the `useFetch` composable from the [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) library. `useFetch` simplifies data fetching and provides built-in caching capabilities.

**Installation:**

First, install VueUse if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install @vueuse/nuxt
# or
yarn add @vueuse/nuxt
# or
pnpm add @vueuse/nuxt
```

Make sure to add `@vueuse/nuxt` to your `modules` array in your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@vueuse/nuxt'],
})
```

**Basic Usage:**

Here's a basic example of using `useFetch` to fetch data and cache it:

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <p v-if="pending">Loading...</p>
    <p v-else-if="error">Error: {{ error.message }}</p>
    <div v-else>
      <h1>{{ data?.title }}</h1>
      <p>{{ data?.body }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const { data, pending, error, refresh } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
</script>
```

In this simple example, `useFetch` automatically caches the response from the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1` endpoint. Subsequent requests to the same URL will retrieve the data from the cache, unless `refresh()` is called.

**Customizing Cache Behavior:**

`useFetch` offers various options to customize the caching behavior:

- **`key`:** Specifies a unique key for the cache. If not provided, the URL is used as the key. Use this if you have multiple requests to the same URL with different parameters or want to manually manage the cache.

```plaintext
<script setup>
const { data, pending, error, refresh } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  query: { userId: 1 },
  key: 'posts-user-1' // Custom cache key
});
</script>
```

- **`getCached`:** A function that allows you to control whether a cached value should be used. This is useful for implementing custom caching logic based on the data itself.

```plaintext
<script setup>
const { data, pending, error, refresh } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', {
  getCached: (cachedData) => {
    // Only use the cache if the data is less than 1 hour old
    if (!cachedData) return false;

    const createdAt = new Date(cachedData.createdAt); // Assuming data has a createdAt field
    const now = new Date();
    const diffInHours = (now.getTime() - createdAt.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
    return diffInHours < 1;
  },
});
</script>
```

- **`transform`:** A function that allows you to transform the data before it's cached. This is useful for normalizing data or extracting only the necessary information.

```plaintext
<script setup>
const { data, pending, error, refresh } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  transform: (response) => response.slice(0, 10), // Only cache the first 10 posts
});
</script>
```

- **`immediate`:** If set to `false`, the request will not be executed immediately. You can then trigger the request manually using `execute()`.

```plaintext
<script setup>
const { data, pending, error, execute } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', { immediate: false });

function fetchData() {
  execute();
}
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="fetchData">Fetch Data</button>
    <p v-if="pending">Loading...</p>
    <p v-else-if="error">Error: {{ error.message }}</p>
    <div v-else>
      <h1>{{ data?.title }}</h1>
      <p>{{ data?.body }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Server-Side Caching in Nuxt 3

While client-side caching is great for improving the user experience, server-side caching is essential for reducing server load and providing consistent data across all users. Nuxt 3 provides a flexible way to implement server-side caching within your API routes.

**Example using `useState` and `useStorage`:**

This example demonstrates using `useState` for simple in-memory caching and `useStorage` for persistence. **Note:** In a production environment, consider using a more robust solution like Redis for server-side caching.

```typescript
// server/api/posts/[id].ts
import { defineEventHandler, getRouterParams, useStorage } from 'h3'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { id } = getRouterParams(event)

  const storage = useStorage('redis') // Or any other storage provider

  const cacheKey = `post:${id}`

  const cachedPost = await storage.getItem(cacheKey)

  if (cachedPost) {
    console.log('Serving from cache!')
    return cachedPost
  }

  console.log('Fetching from API...')

  // Simulate fetching data from an external API
  const post = await $fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${id}`)

  // Store the data in the cache for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
  await storage.setItem(cacheKey, post, { ttl: 3600 })

  return post
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary functions:** `defineEventHandler`, `getRouterParams`, and `useStorage` are imported from the `h3` library, which is the foundation of Nuxt 3 server routes.
2.  **Get the Post ID:** `getRouterParams(event)` extracts the `id` parameter from the URL (e.g., `/api/posts/1`).
3.  **Use `useStorage`:** This obtains an instance of the configured storage provider. In this example, we're using a 'redis' storage (you'll need to configure a redis instance and the appropriate Nuxt module), but you can adapt this to other storage providers. `useStorage` provides a simple key-value store interface. If you are using redis or other external database for useStorage you need to add the following to your `nuxt.config.ts`:
    ```typescript
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      modules: [
        '@vueuse/nuxt',
        [
          '@nuxtjs/redis',
          {
            url: process.env.REDIS_URL || 'redis://localhost:6379',
          },
        ],
      ],
    })
    ```
4.  **Create Cache Key:** A unique cache key is created using the post ID. This ensures that each post has its own cache entry.
5.  **Check the Cache:** `storage.getItem(cacheKey)` attempts to retrieve the data from the cache. If the data is found (i.e., `cachedPost` is not null), it's returned directly, avoiding an API call.
6.  **Fetch from API (if not cached):** If the data is not found in the cache, the code proceeds to fetch it from the external API using `$fetch`.
7.  **Store in Cache:** After fetching the data, it's stored in the cache using `storage.setItem(cacheKey, post, { ttl: 3600 })`. The `ttl` (time-to-live) option specifies the cache duration in seconds (1 hour in this example). This means the data will be automatically removed from the cache after 1 hour. Without the TTL value, the cache will last indefinitely.
8.  **Return the Post:** The fetched post is then returned to the client.

**Important Considerations for Server-Side Caching:**

- **Cache Invalidation:** Determining when to invalidate the cache is crucial. If your data changes frequently, you need a mechanism to clear the cache to ensure users see the latest information. Strategies for cache invalidation include:
  - **Time-Based Expiration (TTL):** The example above uses `ttl` to automatically expire the cache after a certain duration.
  - **Event-Based Invalidation:** When data is updated in your database, trigger an event to clear the corresponding cache entry.
  - **Webhooks:** If your API is updated by external sources, use webhooks to notify your Nuxt 3 application to clear the cache.
- **Cache Storage:** For production environments, consider using a dedicated caching system like:
  - **Redis:** A popular in-memory data store that offers high performance and supports various caching strategies. The example above demonstrates using `useStorage` with redis.
  - **Memcached:** Another popular in-memory caching system.
  - **Cloudflare Cache, Vercel Cache, or other CDN Caching:** Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare or Vercel, with built-in caching capabilities, can significantly improve performance for globally distributed users.
- **Cache Key Generation:** Carefully design your cache keys to ensure they are unique and accurately identify the data being cached. Consider including relevant parameters in the key (e.g., user ID, product ID, etc.).
- **Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR):** Consider using the SWR strategy. SWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidates), and finally comes with the up-to-date data. This approach ensures a snappy UI experience. This approach can be used within `useFetch` with configurations and also with the use of tools like `@nuxtjs/swr`.

## Best Practices for API Caching in Nuxt 3

- **Cache strategically:** Don't cache everything. Focus on data that is frequently accessed and relatively static. Avoid caching highly dynamic data that changes constantly.
- **Choose the right caching strategy:** Consider the specific requirements of your application and choose the caching strategy that best fits your needs (client-side vs. server-side).
- **Implement cache invalidation:** Develop a robust cache invalidation strategy to ensure that your users always see the latest data.
- **Monitor cache performance:** Track cache hit rates and performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.
- **Consider Edge Caching:** Services like Vercel and Netlify offer edge caching, which can distribute your cached content across global data centers, further improving performance for users around the world.

## Conclusion

Caching API responses is a critical optimization technique for building high-performance Nuxt 3 applications. By leveraging `useFetch` for client-side caching and implementing server-side caching strategies using Nuxt 3's server routes and a robust caching system like Redis, you can significantly reduce server load, improve website speed, and provide a better user experience. Remember to carefully consider your caching strategy, cache invalidation, and the type of data you are caching to maximize the benefits and avoid potential issues. Experiment with these techniques and monitor your application's performance to find the optimal caching configuration for your specific needs.
