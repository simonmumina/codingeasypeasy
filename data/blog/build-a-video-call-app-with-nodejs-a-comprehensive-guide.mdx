# Build a Video Call App with Node.js: A Comprehensive Guide

In today's digital age, video communication has become an integral part of our lives. From remote meetings to virtual gatherings with friends and family, video calls are essential for staying connected. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own video call application using Node.js, WebRTC, and Socket.IO.

## What We'll Build

We'll create a simple but functional video call application that allows users to connect to a room and engage in real-time audio and video communication. This application will cover the fundamental aspects of a video call app including:

- **Signaling:** Establishing a connection between users.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** Direct audio and video streaming between users.
- **Room Management:** Allowing multiple users to join the same call.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure you have npm (Node Package Manager) included with Node.js.
- **Text Editor:** Any text editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).
- **Basic JavaScript Knowledge:** Familiarity with JavaScript fundamentals.
- **Understanding of WebSockets:** A basic understanding of how WebSockets work is beneficial, but we'll cover the essentials.

## Project Setup

1.  **Create a Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    mkdir video-call-app
    cd video-call-app
    ```

2.  **Initialize a Node.js Project:**

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    We'll need the following packages:

    - `express`: For creating the web server.
    - `socket.io`: For real-time communication using WebSockets.
    - `nodemon`: (Optional) For automatic server restarts during development.

    ```bash
    npm install express socket.io nodemon
    ```

## Backend (Node.js)

1.  **Create `index.js`:**

    Create a file named `index.js` in your project directory. This will be our main server file.

2.  **Server Setup:**

    ```javascript
    // index.js
    const express = require('express')
    const http = require('http')
    const socketIO = require('socket.io')
    const path = require('path')

    const app = express()
    const server = http.createServer(app)
    const io = socketIO(server)

    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

    // Serve static files from the 'public' directory
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))

    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      console.log('User connected:', socket.id)

      socket.on('join-room', (roomId, userId) => {
        socket.join(roomId)
        socket.to(roomId).emit('user-connected', userId)

        socket.on('disconnect', () => {
          socket.to(roomId).emit('user-disconnected', userId)
          console.log('User disconnected:', socket.id)
        })
      })
    })

    server.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`)
    })
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - We import the necessary modules: `express`, `http`, `socket.io`, and `path`.
    - We create an Express application and an HTTP server using Express.
    - We initialize Socket.IO with the HTTP server.
    - We define the port the server will listen on (defaulting to 3000).
    - We serve static files from the `public` directory (we'll create this later).
    - We listen for `connection` events from new WebSocket clients.
    - When a client connects, we log their ID.
    - We listen for the `join-room` event from the client, which includes the `roomId` and `userId`.
    - We make the client join the specified `roomId` (using `socket.join(roomId)`).
    - We emit the `user-connected` event to all other clients in the room, informing them that a new user has joined and providing their `userId`.
    - We listen for the `disconnect` event and emit a `user-disconnected` event to the other users in the room.

3.  **Add `nodemon` script (optional) to `package.json`:**

    Open your `package.json` file and add the following script under the `scripts` section:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js",
      "dev": "nodemon index.js"
    },
    ```

    Now you can start the server in development mode using `npm run dev`. This will automatically restart the server whenever you save changes to `index.js`.

## Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

1.  **Create `public` directory:**

    Create a directory named `public` in the root of your project. This directory will hold our frontend files.

2.  **Create `public/index.html`:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Video Call App</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Video Call App</h1>

        <div id="video-grid">
          <!--  Video streams will be added here -->
        </div>

        <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

3.  **Create `public/style.css`:**

    ```plaintext
    /* public/style.css */
    body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
        text-align: center;
    }

    #video-grid {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }

    video {
        width: 300px;
        margin: 10px;
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
    ```

4.  **Create `public/script.js`:**

    ```javascript
    // public/script.js
    const socket = io('/')
    const videoGrid = document.getElementById('video-grid')
    const myVideo = document.createElement('video')
    myVideo.muted = true

    const myPeer = new Peer(undefined, {
      host: '/',
      port: '3001', // Must be different from the main app's port (3000).  PeerJS server defaults to 9000
    })

    let myVideoStream

    navigator.mediaDevices
      .getUserMedia({
        video: true,
        audio: true,
      })
      .then((stream) => {
        myVideoStream = stream
        addVideoStream(myVideo, stream)

        myPeer.on('call', (call) => {
          call.answer(stream)
          const video = document.createElement('video')
          call.on('stream', (userVideoStream) => {
            addVideoStream(video, userVideoStream)
          })
        })

        socket.on('user-connected', (userId) => {
          console.log('User connected:', userId)
          connectToNewUser(userId, stream)
        })
      })

    myPeer.on('open', (id) => {
      //  Simulate a roomId (replace with dynamic room ID generation)
      const roomId = '123'
      socket.emit('join-room', roomId, id) // Send the roomId and peer ID to server
    })

    function connectToNewUser(userId, stream) {
      const call = myPeer.call(userId, stream)
      const video = document.createElement('video')
      call.on('stream', (userVideoStream) => {
        addVideoStream(video, userVideoStream)
      })
      call.on('close', () => {
        video.remove()
      })
    }

    function addVideoStream(video, stream) {
      video.srcObject = stream
      video.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', () => {
        video.play()
      })
      videoGrid.append(video)
    }

    socket.on('user-disconnected', (userId) => {
      console.log('User disconnected: ', userId)
    })
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - We connect to the Socket.IO server.
    - We get the `video-grid` element from the HTML.
    - We create a `<video>` element for our own video stream and mute it.
    - **PeerJS Setup:** We create a PeerJS instance. **Important:** PeerJS requires a separate server to handle peer discovery and connection establishment, as WebRTC directly cannot create a call without knowing the ID of the peer it is connecting to. A PeerJS server is generally hosted at port `3001` but any port can be specified.
    - We use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` to get access to the user's camera and microphone.
    - We then:
      - Add our own video stream to the page using `addVideoStream`.
      - Listen for `call` events from other users, answering the call and adding their video stream to the page.
      - Listen for `user-connected` events from the server, indicating that a new user has joined the room, and calling the new user.
    - When the PeerJS instance is ready (`myPeer.on('open')`), we get our unique PeerJS ID and send it to the server along with a room ID using `socket.emit('join-room')`.
    - `connectToNewUser` makes a call to a new user
    - `addVideoStream` attaches the video stream to the `<video>` element and adds it to the page.
    - `socket.on('user-disconnected')` handles the disconnect event, but currently does not remove the user from video.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Node.js Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev  (or npm start)
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

3.  **Open multiple browser windows or tabs:**

    Open the same URL (`http://localhost:3000`) in multiple browser windows or tabs to simulate multiple users. You should now see each user's video stream in the video grid.

## Important: PeerJS Server

The code uses PeerJS to establish the connection between the browser. A PeerJS server must be running for the code to work. You have two options:

1.  **Use a public PeerJS server (for testing ONLY):**

    You can use a public PeerJS server for testing purposes. **However, be aware that these servers are often unreliable and may not be available.** To use a public PeerJS server, remove `host` and `port` options from the peer instantiation.

    ```javascript
    const myPeer = new Peer() //remove the host and port
    ```

2.  **Run your own PeerJS server:**

    This is the recommended approach for development and production.

    - **Install `peer`:**

      ```bash
      npm install peer --save
      ```

    - **Create a `peerServer.js` file in the root of your project:**

      ```javascript
      // peerServer.js
      const { PeerServer } = require('peer')

      const peerServer = PeerServer({ port: 3001, path: '/peerjs' })

      peerServer.on('connection', (client) => {
        console.log('peer connected', client.getId())
      })

      peerServer.on('disconnect', (client) => {
        console.log('peer disconnected', client.getId())
      })
      ```

      This code starts a PeerJS server on port `3001`. You can adjust the port as needed. Make sure it matches the port specified in your front end peer connection instantiation.

    - **Update your Frontend Peer Connection instantiation:**
      ```javascript
      const myPeer = new Peer(undefined, {
        path: '/peerjs',
        host: '/',
        port: '3001',
      })
      ```
    - **Run the PeerJS server in a separate terminal:**

      ```bash
      node peerServer.js
      ```

      Make sure the server is running before you start the main Node.js server.

## Explanation of WebRTC Concepts

- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):** A free, open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple APIs. It allows direct peer-to-peer communication between browsers without the need for intermediate servers to handle the media stream. This reduces latency and improves performance.

- **Signaling:** The process of exchanging metadata between peers to establish a connection. This includes information like session descriptions (SDP) and ICE candidates. Signaling is _not_ part of WebRTC itself; it's a separate mechanism that uses a server (in our case, Socket.IO) to facilitate this exchange.

- **SDP (Session Description Protocol):** A text-based format for describing multimedia sessions, including information about media types, codecs, and network addresses. Peers exchange SDP offers and answers during the signaling process.

- **ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment):** A framework for finding the best path for real-time communication between peers. It handles NAT traversal and firewall issues. ICE agents gather candidate network addresses (ICE candidates) and exchange them with the other peer.

- **STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT):** A protocol used by ICE agents to discover their public IP address and port. It helps peers behind NAT firewalls to communicate with each other.

- **TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT):** A relay server used when direct peer-to-peer connection is not possible (e.g., due to symmetric NAT). Media streams are routed through the TURN server.

## Further Improvements

This is a basic example and can be extended with more features:

- **Dynamic Room ID Generation:** Implement a mechanism to generate unique room IDs for each call.
- **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to control access to rooms.
- **Chat Functionality:** Integrate a chat feature for text-based communication.
- **Screen Sharing:** Enable users to share their screens.
- **Mute/Unmute Audio and Video:** Add controls to mute/unmute audio and video.
- **Layout Management:** Implement different video layout options (e.g., grid view, speaker view).
- **Error Handling:** Add comprehensive error handling to improve the robustness of the application.
- **Styling:** Improve the styling with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Ensure the app is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

## Conclusion

This guide provided a step-by-step approach to building a basic video call application using Node.js, WebRTC, and Socket.IO. By understanding the fundamental concepts and code examples, you can expand this application and create a more feature-rich and robust video communication platform. Remember to run a PeerJS server and handle errors for a production-ready experience. Good luck!
