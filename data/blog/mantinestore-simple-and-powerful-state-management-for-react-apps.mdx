# @mantine/store: Simple and Powerful State Management for React Apps

Managing state effectively is crucial for building robust and maintainable React applications. While numerous state management libraries are available, finding the right balance between power and simplicity can be challenging. Enter `@mantine/store`, a lightweight and intuitive state management solution from the Mantine UI library. This blog post will explore `@mantine/store` in detail, covering its core features, usage, and benefits, comparing it to popular alternatives like Zustand and Jotai.

## What is @mantine/store?

`@mantine/store` is a zero-dependency state management library designed to be easy to learn and use. It's built with TypeScript and focuses on providing a simple API for creating and managing global application state. If you're already using Mantine for your UI components, `@mantine/store` provides a natural and consistent experience. Even if you aren't using Mantine, its lightweight nature and straightforward API make it a valuable addition to your React project.

**Key Features:**

- **Simple API:** Easy to learn and use, requiring minimal boilerplate.
- **TypeScript Support:** Excellent TypeScript support for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Zero Dependencies:** No external dependencies, resulting in a smaller bundle size.
- **Functional Approach:** Emphasizes functional programming principles.
- **Selectors:** Allows derived state to be easily computed.
- **Mutations:** Simple functions to update state.

## Getting Started with @mantine/store

First, install `@mantine/store` using your preferred package manager:

```plaintext
npm install @mantine/store
# or
yarn add @mantine/store
# or
pnpm add @mantine/store
```

Now, let's create a simple store to manage a counter:

```tsx
import { createStore } from '@mantine/store'

interface CounterState {
  count: number
}

const store = createStore<CounterState>({
  count: 0,
})

export const useCounterStore = store.createHook()
export const { setState } = store
```

In this example:

- We import `createStore` from `@mantine/store`.
- We define an interface `CounterState` to specify the structure of our state. This is crucial for TypeScript support.
- We initialize the store with an initial state: `{ count: 0 }`.
- `store.createHook()` creates a React hook, `useCounterStore`, that you can use to access the store's state in your components. This is the primary way you'll interact with the store.
- We extract the `setState` function to directly update the state from anywhere in your application.

## Using the Store in a Component

Now, let's use the `useCounterStore` hook in a React component:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useCounterStore, setState } from './store' // Import your store

function Counter() {
  const { count } = useCounterStore()

  const increment = () => {
    setState((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
  }

  const decrement = () => {
    setState((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 }))
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

In this example:

- We import the `useCounterStore` hook and the `setState` function.
- We use `useCounterStore` to access the `count` property from the store's state.
- The `increment` and `decrement` functions use `setState` to update the `count` property in the store. Notice that `setState` takes a function that receives the current state as an argument, allowing you to update the state based on its previous value.

## Selectors: Deriving State

Selectors allow you to derive state from the store's state without re-rendering unnecessarily. This is similar to `useMemo` but is managed by the store.

```tsx
import { createStore } from '@mantine/store'

interface UserState {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

const store = createStore<UserState>({
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
})

export const useUserStore = store.createHook()

export const useFullName = () => {
  const { firstName, lastName } = useUserStore()
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`
}
export const { setState } = store
```

In this example, `useFullName` is a custom hook that combines `firstName` and `lastName` into a `fullName`. It will only re-render if either `firstName` or `lastName` changes, optimizing performance. You can move this logic directly into `createStore` by defining a selector:

```tsx
import { createStore } from '@mantine/store'

interface UserState {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

const store = createStore<UserState>(
  {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
  },
  (set, get) => ({
    getFullName: () => `${get().firstName} ${get().lastName}`,
  })
)

export const useUserStore = store.createHook()

// getFullName can now be accessed from the store's actions (second argument to createStore)
export const useFullName = () => useUserStore((state) => state.getFullName())
export const { setState } = store
```

This approach keeps your state logic centralized within the store definition.

## Async Actions with @mantine/store

While `@mantine/store` is synchronous, you can easily handle asynchronous actions by using `setState` within asynchronous functions. Here's an example of fetching data from an API:

```tsx
import { createStore } from '@mantine/store'

interface TodoState {
  todos: any[]
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
}

const store = createStore<TodoState>({
  todos: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
})

export const useTodoStore = store.createHook()

export const fetchTodos = async () => {
  setState({ loading: true, error: null }) // Set loading state

  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
    const data = await response.json()
    setState({ todos: data, loading: false }) // Update todos
  } catch (error: any) {
    setState({ error: error.message, loading: false }) // Set error state
  }
}

export const { setState } = store
```

In this example:

- We define a `TodoState` interface with properties for `todos`, `loading`, and `error`.
- The `fetchTodos` function sets the `loading` state to `true` before making the API call.
- Upon successful retrieval of data, it updates the `todos` and sets `loading` to `false`.
- If an error occurs, it sets the `error` message and `loading` to `false`.

In your component, you would call `fetchTodos` using `useEffect` or in response to a user action.

## Comparison with Other State Management Libraries

Let's compare `@mantine/store` with some other popular React state management libraries:

- **Zustand:** Zustand is another lightweight and unopinionated state management library. It is more flexible than `@mantine/store` but requires slightly more setup. `@mantine/store` is more tightly integrated with Mantine UI. Zustand also includes helpful features like persistence middleware out-of-the-box, which `@mantine/store` does not.

- **Jotai:** Jotai is an atomic state management library. It focuses on creating individual atoms of state and composing them together. Jotai is very performant and well-suited for complex applications, but it has a steeper learning curve than `@mantine/store`. Jotai's atomic model can be overkill for simpler use cases.

- **Recoil:** Recoil is developed by Facebook and offers more advanced features like derived state, asynchronous data dependencies, and cross-component state sharing. Recoil can be more complex to set up and understand compared to `@mantine/store`.

- **Redux:** Redux is a more established and comprehensive state management library. It's widely used in larger applications and has a rich ecosystem of middleware and tools. However, Redux involves more boilerplate code and can be overkill for smaller projects.

- **Context API + useReducer:** The built-in React Context API combined with `useReducer` can be sufficient for simpler applications. `@mantine/store` offers a cleaner API than manually managing context and reducers.

**When to Choose @mantine/store:**

- You need a simple and lightweight state management solution.
- You are already using Mantine UI in your project.
- You want to avoid external dependencies.
- You prefer a functional approach to state management.
- Your application has relatively simple state requirements.

## Benefits of Using @mantine/store

- **Simplicity:** Easy to learn and integrate into your project.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal impact on bundle size.
- **TypeScript Support:** Provides excellent type safety and developer experience.
- **Maintainability:** Simple API and functional approach make code easier to maintain.
- **Integration with Mantine:** Seamlessly integrates with other Mantine UI components and utilities.

## Conclusion

`@mantine/store` is a powerful and easy-to-use state management solution for React applications. Its simple API, lightweight nature, and TypeScript support make it an excellent choice for projects of all sizes. While it may not be as feature-rich as some other state management libraries, its simplicity and ease of use make it a valuable addition to your React toolkit, especially if you are already invested in the Mantine ecosystem. Consider it when you need a straightforward and efficient way to manage state in your React applications.
