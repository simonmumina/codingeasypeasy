# NGINX WebSocket Proxy: Configuration Guide for Real-Time Applications

WebSockets are a crucial technology for building modern real-time applications, enabling persistent, two-way communication between clients and servers. NGINX, a powerful and versatile web server, can be configured as a reverse proxy to handle WebSocket connections efficiently. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to set up an NGINX WebSocket proxy for your real-time applications.

## Why Use NGINX as a WebSocket Proxy?

Using NGINX as a WebSocket proxy offers several advantages:

- **Scalability:** NGINX can handle a large number of concurrent WebSocket connections, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
- **Load Balancing:** NGINX can distribute WebSocket traffic across multiple backend servers, ensuring high availability and performance.
- **Security:** NGINX can provide SSL/TLS encryption for WebSocket connections, protecting sensitive data in transit.
- **Centralized Management:** NGINX allows you to manage all your web traffic, including WebSocket connections, from a single point.
- **Buffering:** Nginx's buffering capabilities can help smooth out traffic spikes and improve the overall performance of your real-time application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **An NGINX server:** A working NGINX installation. If you don't have one, install it using your operating system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install nginx` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install nginx` on macOS).
- **A WebSocket server:** A WebSocket server application running on a backend server (e.g., Node.js with `ws` or `socket.io`, Python with `websockets`). For testing, a simple echo server will suffice.
- **Basic knowledge of NGINX configuration:** Familiarity with NGINX configuration files and directives.

## Step-by-Step Configuration

Here's a step-by-step guide to configuring NGINX as a WebSocket proxy:

### 1. Locate Your NGINX Configuration File

The main NGINX configuration file is typically located in one of the following directories:

- `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
- `/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`
- `/usr/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`

You may also have site-specific configuration files within a `sites-available` directory (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`). It's generally best to create a new configuration file in the `sites-available` directory and then create a symbolic link to it in the `sites-enabled` directory. This allows you to easily enable or disable the configuration later.

### 2. Configure the `http` Block

Within the `http` block of your NGINX configuration, ensure that the `map` directive is included and configured to handle the `Upgrade` header. This header is used to initiate the WebSocket handshake.

```nginx
http {
    # ... other configurations ...

    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    # ... other configurations ...
}
```

This `map` directive creates a variable `$connection_upgrade` based on the value of the `$http_upgrade` header. If the `$http_upgrade` header is present (indicating a WebSocket upgrade request), `$connection_upgrade` will be set to `upgrade`. Otherwise, it will be set to `close`. This variable will be used later in the `proxy_set_header` directive.

### 3. Create a Server Block for Your WebSocket Proxy

Create a new server block in your NGINX configuration file to handle WebSocket connections. This block will define the domain or IP address and port that clients will use to connect to the WebSocket server.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80; # Or 443 for HTTPS
    server_name yourdomain.com; # Replace with your domain name

    # If using HTTPS, configure SSL certificates
    # ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.pem;
    # ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;

    location /ws {  # Define the path for WebSocket connections
        proxy_pass http://backend-websocket-server:3000; # Replace with your WebSocket server's address and port
        proxy_http_version 1.1;  # Important for WebSocket compatibility
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host; # Forward the original host header
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; # Pass the client's IP address
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # Forward the original client IP address
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the directives:**

- `listen`: Specifies the port that NGINX will listen on (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
- `server_name`: Specifies the domain name or IP address that the server block will respond to.
- `location /ws`: Defines a location block that matches requests to the `/ws` path. This is where WebSocket connections will be handled. Adjust this to match the path your client uses to connect.
- `proxy_pass`: Specifies the address and port of the backend WebSocket server. Replace `http://backend-websocket-server:3000` with the actual address of your WebSocket server. If your WebSocket server is using SSL/TLS (wss://), ensure you use `https://` and have the appropriate SSL configuration.
- `proxy_http_version 1.1`: This is crucial. WebSockets require HTTP/1.1 or later.
- `proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade`: Forwards the `Upgrade` header from the client to the backend server.
- `proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade`: Forwards the `Connection` header from the client to the backend server. This is where the `$connection_upgrade` variable from the `map` directive is used.
- `proxy_set_header Host $host`: Forwards the original `Host` header from the client to the backend server. This is important for virtual hosting and routing on the backend server.
- `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr`: Passes the client's IP address to the backend server. This is helpful for logging and security purposes.
- `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`: Forwards the original client IP address through any intermediate proxies.

### 4. Handling HTTPS and SSL/TLS

For secure WebSocket connections (wss://), you'll need to configure SSL/TLS. This involves obtaining an SSL certificate and configuring NGINX to use it.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;

    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://backend-websocket-server:3000; # Or https://backend-websocket-server:3000 if backend uses SSL
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

**Important Considerations for HTTPS:**

- **Obtain an SSL Certificate:** You can obtain a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt or purchase one from a commercial Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Configure SSL Certificate Paths:** Replace `/path/to/your/certificate.pem` and `/path/to/your/private.key` with the actual paths to your SSL certificate and private key files.
- **Check Backend Server SSL:** If your backend WebSocket server also uses HTTPS, you'll need to ensure that Nginx can properly verify the backend server's SSL certificate. Consider using `proxy_ssl_verify on;` and `proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate /path/to/ca_certificate.pem;` to ensure proper SSL validation.

### 5. Reload NGINX Configuration

After making changes to your NGINX configuration, you need to reload the configuration for the changes to take effect. Use the following command:

```plaintext
sudo nginx -t  # Test the configuration for errors
sudo nginx -s reload # Reload the configuration
```

The `nginx -t` command is crucial to ensure that your configuration is valid before reloading Nginx. This will prevent downtime caused by configuration errors.

### 6. Testing the WebSocket Proxy

To test the WebSocket proxy, you can use a WebSocket client library or a browser-based WebSocket client. Here's a simple JavaScript example using the built-in `WebSocket` API:

```plaintext
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://yourdomain.com/ws') // Or wss:// for HTTPS

socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection established')
  socket.send('Hello from the client!')
}

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Received: ' + event.data)
}

socket.onclose = () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection closed')
}

socket.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', error)
}
```

Replace `ws://yourdomain.com/ws` with the actual URL of your WebSocket proxy. Open the JavaScript console in your browser and run this code. You should see the messages "WebSocket connection established" and "Received: Hello from the client!" if the proxy is configured correctly and your backend server is echoing back the message.

### Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **"400 Bad Request" or "Invalid Upgrade Header":** This usually indicates that the `proxy_http_version 1.1` directive is missing or that the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers are not being properly forwarded. Double-check your Nginx configuration.
- **Connection Refused:** This usually means that the backend WebSocket server is not running or that the `proxy_pass` directive is pointing to the wrong address or port.
- **SSL Errors:** If you're using HTTPS, ensure that your SSL certificates are correctly configured and that Nginx can properly verify the backend server's SSL certificate if it's also using HTTPS. Check the Nginx error logs for SSL-related errors.
- **Nginx Error Logs:** The Nginx error logs (typically located in `/var/log/nginx/error.log`) are an invaluable resource for troubleshooting any issues. Examine the logs for error messages that can provide clues about the cause of the problem.

### Advanced Configuration Options

- **Load Balancing:** To distribute WebSocket traffic across multiple backend servers, you can use NGINX's upstream module. Define an upstream block with the addresses of your backend servers and then use the upstream block in the `proxy_pass` directive.

  ```nginx
  upstream websocket_backends {
      server backend-websocket-server1:3000;
      server backend-websocket-server2:3000;
  }

  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name yourdomain.com;

      location /ws {
          proxy_pass http://websocket_backends;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Sticky Sessions (IP Hash):** For some WebSocket applications, it's important to ensure that a client is always connected to the same backend server. You can achieve this using the `ip_hash` directive in the upstream block.

  ```nginx
  upstream websocket_backends {
      ip_hash;
      server backend-websocket-server1:3000;
      server backend-websocket-server2:3000;
  }
  ```

- **Timeouts:** You can configure timeouts to prevent long-running WebSocket connections from consuming resources. Use the `proxy_read_timeout` and `proxy_send_timeout` directives.

  ```nginx
  location /ws {
      proxy_pass http://backend-websocket-server:3000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_read_timeout 300s; # 5 minutes
      proxy_send_timeout 300s; # 5 minutes
  }
  ```

- **Buffering:** Disable buffering to reduce latency for real-time applications.

  ```nginx
   location /ws {
      proxy_pass http://backend-websocket-server:3000;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_buffering off; # Disable buffering
   }
  ```

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep Nginx Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Nginx to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
- **Use SSL/TLS (HTTPS):** Always use SSL/TLS to encrypt WebSocket connections and protect sensitive data in transit.
- **Limit Access:** Restrict access to the WebSocket proxy to authorized clients only. You can use Nginx's access control features to achieve this.
- **Monitor Nginx Logs:** Regularly monitor Nginx logs for suspicious activity.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
