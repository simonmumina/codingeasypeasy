# How to Repair Windows Using CMD: SFC /scannow and DISM Guide

Is your Windows operating system acting up? Experiencing frequent crashes, strange error messages, or sluggish performance? Chances are, your Windows installation may be corrupted. Fortunately, Windows comes with built-in tools that you can access through the command prompt (CMD) to diagnose and repair system files. This guide will walk you through using two powerful command-line utilities: **System File Checker (SFC /scannow)** and **Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)**.

## Why Repair Windows with CMD?

Using CMD for Windows repair offers several advantages:

*   **Built-in Tools:**  You don't need to download any external software. SFC and DISM are part of your Windows installation.
*   **Effective for System File Corruption:** These tools are specifically designed to detect and repair corrupted system files, which are often the root cause of Windows instability.
*   **Automation:** The repair process is largely automated, saving you time and effort compared to manual troubleshooting.
*   **Accessibility:**  CMD is accessible even when Windows is experiencing boot issues, allowing you to attempt repairs from the Recovery Environment.

## Part 1: System File Checker (SFC /scannow)

The System File Checker (SFC) is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corrupt Windows system files.  It works by verifying the integrity of all protected system files and replacing incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.

### How to Run SFC /scannow

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**
    *   Type `cmd` in the Windows search bar.
    *   Right-click on "Command Prompt" in the search results and select "Run as administrator".
    *   You'll likely be prompted for administrator credentials.  Enter them to proceed.

2.  **Run the SFC Command:**
    *   In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:

        ```
        sfc /scannow
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `sfc` is the System File Checker command.
        *   `/scannow` is the switch that instructs SFC to scan all protected system files and replace corrupted files.

3.  **Wait for the Scan to Complete:**
    *   The scan can take a considerable amount of time, often ranging from 15 minutes to an hour or more, depending on the size of your hard drive and the extent of the corruption.  Let the process complete without interruption.
    *   You'll see a progress indicator in the Command Prompt window.

4.  **Review the Results:**
    *   Once the scan is complete, you'll see one of the following messages:

        *   **"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."** This means SFC didn't find any corrupted system files.  While this is good news from SFC's perspective, it suggests your issues may stem from other sources, such as hardware problems, driver conflicts, or malware.

        *   **"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them."**  This is the best-case scenario.  SFC found and fixed the corruption.  Restart your computer to see if the problems are resolved.

        *   **"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them."**  This means SFC found corruption but couldn't repair it all.  In this case, proceed to Part 2: Using DISM.

        *   **"You must be an administrator running a console session in order to use the sfc utility."** This means you did not run the command prompt with administrator privileges. Close the command prompt and follow step 1 to open it as an administrator and try again.

### Important Considerations for SFC /scannow:

*   **Do not interrupt the scan:**  Interrupting the scan can lead to further system instability.
*   **Ensure a stable power supply:** Power outages during the scan can corrupt files.  Consider using a laptop with a charged battery or a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) on a desktop.
*   **Run SFC /scannow in Safe Mode:** If you're experiencing significant system instability, try running SFC /scannow in Safe Mode. To access Safe Mode, restart your computer and repeatedly press the F8 key (or Shift+F8) as it starts up.  Select "Safe Mode with Command Prompt".

## Part 2: Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)

The Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool is a more advanced command-line utility used to service and prepare Windows images, including those used for deployment and recovery.  It can also be used to repair the Windows Component Store, which is essentially a repository of files used to repair and update Windows.

Think of DISM as a repair tool for the source of truth for system files. If the SFC scan couldn't find good files to replace the corrupted ones, DISM can potentially fix *that* issue.

### How to Run DISM

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:** (Same as in Part 1)

2.  **Run the DISM CheckHealth Command:**
    *   Type the following command and press Enter:

        ```
        DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `DISM` is the Deployment Image Servicing and Management command.
        *   `/Online` targets the currently running operating system.
        *   `/Cleanup-Image` specifies cleanup actions.
        *   `/CheckHealth` checks for component store corruption.  This is a quick check and won't perform any repairs.

    *   This command will quickly check if the image has been flagged as corrupted. It's a good initial step.

3.  **Run the DISM ScanHealth Command:**
    *   Type the following command and press Enter:

        ```
        DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `/ScanHealth` performs a more detailed scan to detect corruption in the component store.  This can take several minutes.

    *   This command will scan the image for corruption, but it still won't perform any repairs. It is more thorough than CheckHealth.

4.  **Run the DISM RestoreHealth Command:**
    *   This is the most important command for repairing Windows with DISM. Type the following command and press Enter:

        ```
        DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `/RestoreHealth` attempts to automatically repair the Windows image by downloading healthy versions of the corrupted files from Windows Update. This requires an active internet connection.

    *   This command can take a significant amount of time, even longer than SFC /scannow.  Be patient and let it complete.

5.  **Review the Results:**
    *   After the DISM command completes, review the output in the Command Prompt window.  It will indicate whether the repair was successful.
    *   If DISM successfully repaired the image, it's highly recommended to run SFC /scannow again (as described in Part 1) to ensure that all system files are now in a consistent and healthy state.

### Using a Windows Installation Source as a Repair Source (If DISM Fails):

If the `/RestoreHealth` command fails to repair the Windows image using Windows Update, you can specify a Windows installation source (such as a DVD or an ISO file) as the repair source.  This is useful if your internet connection is unreliable or if Windows Update is consistently failing.

1.  **Mount the Windows ISO or Insert the DVD:**

    *   **ISO:** Double-click the ISO file to mount it as a virtual drive. Note the drive letter assigned to the mounted ISO (e.g., `D:`).
    *   **DVD:** Insert the Windows installation DVD into your DVD drive.  Note the drive letter assigned to the DVD drive (e.g., `E:`).

2.  **Run the DISM RestoreHealth Command with the Source:**

    *   Replace `<drive_letter>` with the actual drive letter of the mounted ISO or DVD drive.  For example, if the ISO is mounted as drive `D:`, the command would be:

        ```
        DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:<drive_letter>:\sources\install.wim:1 /limitaccess
        ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   `/Source:wim:<drive_letter>:\sources\install.wim:1` specifies the path to the `install.wim` file within the Windows installation source. This file contains the healthy Windows files needed for repair.  The `:1` specifies that the first image in the WIM file should be used (most `install.wim` files only contain one image).  If you're using an `install.esd` file, replace `install.wim` with `install.esd`.
        *   `/limitaccess` prevents DISM from using Windows Update as a repair source.

3.  **Wait for the Process to Complete:**
    *   This process will also take a considerable amount of time.

4.  **Review the Results:**
    *   Check the Command Prompt output for the results.

5.  **Run SFC /scannow Again:**
    *   As before, run SFC /scannow after DISM completes to ensure all system files are consistent.

### Important Considerations for DISM:

*   **Internet Connection:**  For the `/RestoreHealth` command without a specified source, a stable internet connection is essential to download the necessary files from Windows Update.
*   **Enough Disk Space:** DISM may require significant disk space on your system drive (usually C:) to store temporary files during the repair process. Ensure you have enough free space.
*   **Windows Version Compatibility:**  The Windows installation source you use for the `/Source` option should be the *same* version and edition of Windows that is currently installed on your computer.  Using an incompatible source can lead to further problems. To verify this, you can use the `winver` command.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **"Error 87":** This error often indicates a syntax error in the DISM command. Double-check the command for typos or missing spaces. It can also indicate that the `install.wim` or `install.esd` file cannot be found at the specified path. Make sure that the source file exists.
*   **"Error 1726":**  This error can occur if the Windows Update service is not running or is experiencing problems. Try restarting the Windows Update service (via `services.msc`) and then retry the DISM command.
*   **"Error 0x800f081f":** This error can mean that DISM couldn't find the source files. Double check your source path. Using the correct source for your build of Windows is also crucial.
*   **Long scan times:** The scan may appear to be frozen. This can be normal, especially on older computers. Give it plenty of time to finish. Check your hard drive activity light to verify that the disk is still being accessed.
*   **Still having issues?**  If SFC and DISM fail to resolve your problems, consider other troubleshooting steps, such as:
    *   **Checking your hardware:**  Run memory diagnostics and hard drive checks to rule out hardware failures.
    *   **Updating drivers:**  Outdated or corrupted drivers can cause instability. Update your device drivers, especially those for your graphics card, network adapter, and chipset.
    *   **Scanning for malware:** Malware infections can cause system corruption. Run a full system scan with a reputable antivirus program.
    *   **Performing a system restore:** Restore your computer to a previous point in time when it was working properly.
    *   **Performing a clean install of Windows:**  As a last resort, consider performing a clean install of Windows.  This will erase all data on your hard drive, so be sure to back up your important files beforehand.
