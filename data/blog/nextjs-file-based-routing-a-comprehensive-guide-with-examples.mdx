# Next.js File-Based Routing: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Next.js has revolutionized React development, offering a powerful and intuitive way to build performant and SEO-friendly web applications. One of its core strengths is its **file-based routing system**, which simplifies the process of defining application routes and handling navigation. This guide provides a deep dive into Next.js file-based routing, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced techniques, complete with practical code examples.

## What is File-Based Routing?

File-based routing is a method of defining your application's routes by organizing files and directories within a specific folder structure. In Next.js, this special folder is named `app` (or `pages` for the legacy Pages Router). Each file within this folder directly corresponds to a route in your application.

**Why is it beneficial?**

- **Simplicity and Clarity:** Routes are defined implicitly by your file structure, making it easy to understand the application's routing scheme at a glance.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** You don't need to write explicit route configuration files, saving you time and effort.
- **Automatic Routing:** Next.js automatically generates routes based on your file system.
- **Improved Organization:** Encourages a well-structured project layout.

## The `app` Directory (or `pages` for legacy)

The `app` directory (introduced in Next.js 13) or `pages` directory (the previous routing system) is the heart of file-based routing in Next.js. Inside this directory, each file represents a route. Let's start with some basic examples using the `app` directory.

**Basic Routing**

1.  **`app/page.js`:** This file will render the homepage of your application, accessible at the root route `/`.

    ```plaintext
    // app/page.js
    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome to my Next.js App!</h1>
          <p>This is the homepage.</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

2.  **`app/about/page.js`:** This file defines the route `/about`.

    ```plaintext
    // app/about/page.js
    export default function About() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>Learn more about our company.</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

3.  **`app/contact/page.js`:** This file defines the route `/contact`.

    ```plaintext
    // app/contact/page.js
    export default function Contact() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Contact Us</h1>
          <p>Get in touch with us.</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

**Key Takeaways:**

- The `page.js` file is the default entry point for a route segment (a directory within `app`).
- The directory structure directly mirrors the URL structure of your application.
- You can create nested routes by creating subdirectories within `app`.

## Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes allow you to create routes with parameters. This is useful for displaying content based on a unique identifier, such as an article ID, product ID, or username. Next.js uses square brackets `[]` to denote dynamic route segments.

1.  **`app/blog/[id]/page.js`:** This defines a dynamic route where `[id]` is a parameter that will be passed to your component.

    ```plaintext
    // app/blog/[id]/page.js
    export default async function BlogPost({ params }) {
      const { id } = params;
      // Fetch data for the blog post with the given ID
      const post = await fetch(`https://your-api.com/posts/${id}`).then(res => res.json());

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Blog Post ID: {id}</h1>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - The filename `[id]` tells Next.js that this route segment is dynamic.
    - The `params` object, passed as a prop to your page component, contains the values of the dynamic segments. In this case, `params.id` will contain the ID from the URL (e.g., `/blog/123`).
    - We are using `async/await` and `fetch` to simulate fetching data from an API based on the provided `id`. Remember to replace `"https://your-api.com/posts/${id}"` with your actual API endpoint.

2.  **Generating Dynamic Params with `generateStaticParams`:** For statically generated routes, you can use `generateStaticParams` to pre-render specific dynamic routes during build time.

    ```plaintext
    // app/blog/[id]/page.js
    export async function generateStaticParams() {
      const posts = await fetch('https://your-api.com/posts').then(res => res.json());

      return posts.map(post => ({
        id: post.id.toString(), // Ensure the ID is a string
      }));
    }

    export default async function BlogPost({ params }) {
      const { id } = params;
      const post = await fetch(`https://your-api.com/posts/${id}`).then(res => res.json());

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Blog Post ID: {id}</h1>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `generateStaticParams` is an async function that returns an array of objects. Each object defines the parameters for a dynamic route that should be statically generated.
    - In this example, we fetch a list of blog posts from an API and then map them to an array of objects, where each object has an `id` property. Next.js will use these IDs to generate the corresponding routes at build time (e.g., `/blog/1`, `/blog/2`, etc.).
    - **Important:** Ensure that the values returned by `generateStaticParams` are strings, as the `params` object will always contain string values.

## Catch-All Routes

Catch-all routes allow you to match any number of segments in a route. They are defined using three dots `[...]` within the square brackets.

1.  **`app/blog/[...slug]/page.js`:** This defines a catch-all route. For example, `/blog/2024/01/02/my-first-post` would be matched by this route.

    ```plaintext
    // app/blog/[...slug]/page.js
    export default function BlogPost({ params }) {
      const { slug } = params;
      const fullSlug = slug ? slug.join('/') : 'No slug provided';

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Blog Post Slug: {fullSlug}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `[...slug]` creates a catch-all route. The `slug` parameter will be an array containing all the segments of the URL after `/blog/`.
    - `slug.join('/')` joins the array elements into a single string, separated by slashes.
    - If no slug is provided (e.g., `/blog/`), the code handles that case gracefully.

## Optional Catch-All Routes

Optional catch-all routes are similar to catch-all routes, but they are optional. They are defined using double square brackets `[[...slug]]`. This allows the route to match even if no slug is provided.

1.  **`app/blog/[[...slug]]/page.js`:** This defines an optional catch-all route. This route would match `/blog` as well as `/blog/2024/01/02/my-first-post`.

    ```plaintext
    // app/blog/[[...slug]]/page.js
    export default function BlogPost({ params }) {
      const { slug } = params;
      const fullSlug = slug ? slug.join('/') : 'No slug provided';

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Blog Post Slug: {fullSlug}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `[[...slug]]` creates an optional catch-all route.
    - If the URL is `/blog`, the `slug` parameter will be `undefined`, and the code handles this case.

## Route Groups

Route groups allow you to organize your routes without affecting the URL structure. They are defined by enclosing a directory name in parentheses `()`.

1.  **`(marketing)/about/page.js`:** This file defines the route `/about`. The `marketing` directory is a route group and does not appear in the URL.

    ```plaintext
    // app/(marketing)/about/page.js
    export default function About() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>About Us (Marketing)</h1>
          <p>Learn more about our marketing initiatives.</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

2.  **Why use route groups?**

    - **Organization:** Helps keep your `app` directory organized, especially for large projects.
    - **Layouts:** Allows you to apply different layouts to different sections of your application. For instance, you might have a `(marketing)` route group with a different layout than your `(dashboard)` route group.
    - **Modularity:** Facilitates breaking down your application into smaller, more manageable modules.

## Route Handlers (API Routes)

While the `page.js` file handles rendering UI components, Route Handlers (formerly API Routes) are used to create API endpoints. These are defined in files named `route.js` or `route.ts` within the `app` directory.

1.  **`app/api/users/route.js`:** This file defines an API endpoint at `/api/users`.

    ```plaintext
    // app/api/users/route.js
    export async function GET(request) {
      const users = [
        { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' },
        { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith' },
      ];

      return Response.json(users);
    }

    export async function POST(request) {
      const data = await request.json();
      console.log("Received data:", data);
      return Response.json({ message: "User created successfully", data });
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - The `GET` function handles GET requests to the `/api/users` endpoint. It returns a JSON response containing an array of users.
    - The `POST` function handles POST requests to the `/api/users` endpoint. It parses the request body as JSON, logs the data, and returns a confirmation message.
    - You can define other HTTP methods (e.g., `PUT`, `DELETE`) as needed.

## Linking Between Pages

To navigate between pages, you use the `<Link>` component from `next/link`.

```plaintext
// app/page.js
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js App!</h1>
      <p>This is the homepage.</p>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>Go to About Page</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/blog/123">
        <a>Go to Blog Post 123</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Import `Link` from `next/link`.
- Use the `href` prop to specify the destination URL.
- Wrap the `<a>` tag (or any other element you want to be clickable) within the `<Link>` component.

## Using the `useRouter` Hook

For programmatic navigation or accessing route information within a component, you can use the `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation`.

```plaintext
// app/components/MyComponent.js
'use client' // This is a client component

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
      //Example - Redirect after a delay
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
          router.push('/about');
      }, 3000); // Redirect after 3 seconds

      return () => clearTimeout(timer); // Cleanup the timer
  }, [router]);


  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/contact'); // Navigate to the contact page
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Navigating programmatically...</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Contact Page</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Import `useRouter` from `next/navigation`.
- Call `useRouter()` within your component to get a router object.
- Use `router.push(url)` to navigate to a different page.
- The `useRouter` hook must be used within a Client Component. Add `'use client'` at the top of the file.

## Differences between the `app` and `pages` directory

It's important to understand the key differences between the older `pages` directory and the new `app` directory.

| Feature           | `pages` Directory (Legacy)                                | `app` Directory (New)                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Routing System    | File-based Routing                                        | File-based Routing                            |
| Data Fetching     | `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `getInitialProps` | React Server Components, Server Actions       |
| Component Model   | Client-Side Components                                    | React Server Components, Client Components    |
| Layouts           | Custom components required                                | Built-in layouts with the `layout.js` file    |
| Client Components | Automatic Code Splitting                                  | Explicitly declared using `'use client'`      |
| Performance       | Can be slower due to client-side rendering                | Improved performance due to Server Components |

## Best Practices

- **Keep your `app` directory organized:** Use route groups and meaningful file names to maintain a clear and understandable structure.
- **Use meaningful names for dynamic route parameters:** Choose names that clearly indicate the purpose of the parameter (e.g., `id`, `slug`, `username`).
- **Handle errors gracefully:** Implement error handling to prevent your application from crashing when dynamic route parameters are invalid or data fetching fails. Utilize `try...catch` blocks within your Server Components and Route Handlers.
- **Use `generateStaticParams` for pre-rendering:** When possible, use `generateStaticParams` to pre-render dynamic routes at build time, improving performance and SEO.
- **Leverage layouts:** Use the `layout.js` file to define shared layouts for different sections of your application, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
- **Understand the difference between Server and Client Components:** Use Server Components by default for improved performance. Use Client Components only when necessary for interactive elements and client-side logic.
