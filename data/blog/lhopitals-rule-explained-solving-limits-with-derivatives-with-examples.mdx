# L'Hôpital's Rule Explained: Solving Limits with Derivatives (With Examples)

L'Hôpital's Rule is a powerful tool in calculus that helps us evaluate limits that result in indeterminate forms. If you've ever encountered a limit like $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ that directly evaluates to $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, then L'Hôpital's Rule might be just what you need!

## What is L'Hôpital's Rule?

L'Hôpital's Rule (sometimes spelled L'Hospital's Rule) states that if we have a limit of the form $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ where:

*   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable on an open interval containing $c$ (except possibly at $c$).
*   $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$, or $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \pm \infty$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = \pm \infty$.
*   $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$ exists (or is $\pm \infty$).

Then,

$\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$

In simpler terms, if you have an indeterminate form of $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, you can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator *separately* and then try to evaluate the limit again.

## Why Does L'Hôpital's Rule Work?

The rule's justification relies on the concept of linear approximation and the Mean Value Theorem. Essentially, near the point $c$, we can approximate $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ using their tangent lines. The ratio of these tangent lines at $c$ becomes equal to the ratio of their derivatives at $c$, thus explaining the rule's core principle. A rigorous proof is more involved and relies on Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem.

## Indeterminate Forms

L'Hôpital's Rule is specifically designed for *indeterminate forms*. Here's a breakdown of the most common ones:

*   **0/0:** The classic case. Both the numerator and denominator approach zero.
*   **∞/∞:** Both the numerator and denominator approach infinity (positive or negative).
*   **0 ⋅ ∞:** This can be rewritten as $\frac{0}{1/∞}$ or $\frac{∞}{1/0}$, both of which are in the form 0/0 or ∞/∞.
*   **∞ - ∞:** This requires algebraic manipulation to be expressed as a fraction.
*   **1<sup>∞</sup>, 0<sup>0</sup>, ∞<sup>0</sup>:** These exponential indeterminate forms are typically handled by taking the natural logarithm of the expression.  Let $y = f(x)^{g(x)}$, then $\ln(y) = g(x) \ln(f(x))$, which might result in a 0 ⋅ ∞ form.

## How to Apply L'Hôpital's Rule

Here's a step-by-step guide to applying L'Hôpital's Rule effectively:

1.  **Verify the Indeterminate Form:** The most crucial step!  Always check if the limit results in an indeterminate form (0/0 or ∞/∞) *before* applying the rule.  If the limit is determinate (e.g., 5/0, 0/7, 2/∞), applying L'Hôpital's Rule will lead to incorrect results.
2.  **Differentiate the Numerator and Denominator:** Find $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$. Remember, you are *not* using the quotient rule! You're taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator *separately*.
3.  **Evaluate the New Limit:** Calculate $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$.
4.  **Repeat if Necessary:** If the new limit is still an indeterminate form, you can apply L'Hôpital's Rule again (provided the conditions are still met).  You might need to apply the rule multiple times.
5.  **Be Careful:** Don't apply L'Hôpital's Rule if the limit *isn't* an indeterminate form.  Also, sometimes algebraic simplification is a much easier approach.  L'Hôpital's Rule should be a tool in your arsenal, not the only tool.

## Examples with Code

Let's illustrate L'Hôpital's Rule with several examples. We'll also include Python code using the `sympy` library to verify our results.

**Example 1:  The Classic 0/0 Case**

Find $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$.

1.  **Verification:**  $\lim_{x \to 0} \sin(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to 0} x = 0$.  So, we have the indeterminate form 0/0.

2.  **Differentiation:**  $f(x) = \sin(x)$, so $f'(x) = \cos(x)$.  $g(x) = x$, so $g'(x) = 1$.

3.  **Evaluate New Limit:** $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{1} = \frac{\cos(0)}{1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$.

Therefore, $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$.

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
f = sp.sin(x) / x
limit = sp.limit(f, x, 0)
print(limit)  # Output: 1
```

**Example 2:  ∞/∞ Case**

Find $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}$.

1.  **Verification:**  $\lim_{x \to \infty} x^2 = \infty$ and $\lim_{x \to \infty} e^x = \infty$. So, we have the indeterminate form ∞/∞.

2.  **Differentiation:**  $f(x) = x^2$, so $f'(x) = 2x$. $g(x) = e^x$, so $g'(x) = e^x$.

3.  **Evaluate New Limit:** $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x}{e^x}$.  This is still of the form ∞/∞, so we apply L'Hôpital's Rule again.

4.  **Second Differentiation:**  $f'(x) = 2x$, so $f''(x) = 2$. $g'(x) = e^x$, so $g''(x) = e^x$.

5.  **Evaluate Final Limit:** $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2}{e^x} = 0$.

Therefore, $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0$.

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
f = x**2 / sp.exp(x)
limit = sp.limit(f, x, sp.oo)
print(limit)  # Output: 0
```

**Example 3:  Applying Multiple Times**

Find $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^3 - 1}{x - 1}$.

1.  **Verification:** $\lim_{x \to 1} (x^3 - 1) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to 1} (x - 1) = 0$. So, we have the indeterminate form 0/0.

2.  **Differentiation:** $f(x) = x^3 - 1$, so $f'(x) = 3x^2$. $g(x) = x - 1$, so $g'(x) = 1$.

3.  **Evaluate New Limit:** $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{3x^2}{1} = \frac{3(1)^2}{1} = 3$.

Therefore, $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^3 - 1}{x - 1} = 3$.  Notice this could also be solved by factoring: $\frac{x^3 - 1}{x - 1} = \frac{(x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)}{x-1} = x^2 + x + 1$, and then taking the limit.  Factoring is often a quicker and simpler solution than L'Hopital's rule if it is possible.

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
f = (x**3 - 1) / (x - 1)
limit = sp.limit(f, x, 1)
print(limit)  # Output: 3
```

**Example 4:  Transforming to an Indeterminate Form**

Find $\lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln(x)$.

1.  **Verification:**  $\lim_{x \to 0^+} x = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \ln(x) = -\infty$.  This is the indeterminate form 0 ⋅ (-∞).

2.  **Rewrite:** We can rewrite this as $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\ln(x)}{1/x}$, which is now of the form (-∞)/∞.

3.  **Differentiation:** $f(x) = \ln(x)$, so $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$. $g(x) = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$, so $g'(x) = -x^{-2} = -\frac{1}{x^2}$.

4.  **Evaluate New Limit:** $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1/x}{-1/x^2} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} (-x) = 0$.

Therefore, $\lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln(x) = 0$.

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
f = x * sp.log(x)
limit = sp.limit(f, x, 0, dir='+') # dir='+' specifies the limit from the right
print(limit)  # Output: 0
```

**Example 5:  Exponential Indeterminate Form (1<sup>∞</sup>)**

Find $\lim_{x \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{x})^x$.

1.  **Verification:** $\lim_{x \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{x}) = 1$ and $\lim_{x \to \infty} x = \infty$. This is the indeterminate form 1<sup>∞</sup>.

2.  **Logarithmic Transformation:** Let $y = (1 + \frac{1}{x})^x$. Then, $\ln(y) = x \ln(1 + \frac{1}{x})$.

3.  **Rewrite:** $\ln(y) = \frac{\ln(1 + \frac{1}{x})}{1/x}$. Now we have the form 0/0.

4.  **Differentiation:** $f(x) = \ln(1 + \frac{1}{x})$, so $f'(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{x}} \cdot (-\frac{1}{x^2}) = \frac{-1}{x(x+1)}$.  $g(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, so $g'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2}$.

5.  **Evaluate New Limit:** $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\frac{-1}{x(x+1)}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{x(x+1)} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{x+1} = 1$.

6.  **Solve for y:**  Since $\lim_{x \to \infty} \ln(y) = 1$, then $\lim_{x \to \infty} y = e^1 = e$.

Therefore, $\lim_{x \to \infty} (1 + \frac{1}{x})^x = e$.

```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
f = (1 + 1/x)**x
limit = sp.limit(f, x, sp.oo)
print(limit)  # Output: E
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

*   **Applying the Rule When it's Not Needed:**  Remember to *always* check for an indeterminate form first!
*   **Using the Quotient Rule Instead of Separate Differentiation:**  L'Hôpital's Rule involves taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator *separately*.  Do *not* use the quotient rule!
*   **Stopping Too Soon:** You might need to apply the rule multiple times.
*   **Not Simplifying After Each Step:**  Simplifying the expression after each differentiation can make subsequent steps easier.
*   **Forgetting to Transform Non-Fractional Forms:** Remember to rewrite indeterminate products, differences, and exponents into fractional forms before applying L'Hôpital's Rule.
