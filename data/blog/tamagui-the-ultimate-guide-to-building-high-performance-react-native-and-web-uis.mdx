## Getting Started with Tamagui

Let's dive into the practical aspects of setting up and using Tamagui.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Basic knowledge of React and React Native

### Installation

The easiest way to get started with Tamagui is using the CLI:

```plaintext
npx create-tamagui@latest my-app
```

This command will guide you through setting up a new Tamagui project. You can choose between various templates, including Expo and Next.js.

Alternatively, you can install it manually into an existing project. For example, if you're using Next.js:

```plaintext
npm install tamagui @tamagui/config-standard styled-components react-native-web react-native-safe-area-context
```

or with yarn:

```plaintext
yarn add tamagui @tamagui/config-standard styled-components react-native-web react-native-safe-area-context
```

### Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure Tamagui in your project. This typically involves setting up the `tamagui.config.ts` file and configuring your build tools.

1.  **`tamagui.config.ts`:**

    This file defines your Tamagui configuration, including your theme, fonts, and media queries. A basic configuration might look like this:

    ```plaintext
    // tamagui.config.ts
    import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'
    import { createFont, createTheme, createMedia } from '@tamagui/core'
    import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
    import { themes } from '@tamagui/themes'
    import { createTokens } from '@tamagui/theme-builder'

    const config = createTamagui({
      defaultTheme: 'light',
      shouldAddPrefersColorThemes: true,
      themeClassNameOnRoot: true,
      themes: {
        ...themes,
      },
      shorthands,
      fonts: {
        heading: createFont({
          family: 'System',
          size: {
            1: 12,
            2: 14,
            3: 16,
          },
        }),
        body: createFont({
          family: 'System',
          size: {
            1: 12,
            2: 14,
            3: 16,
          },
        }),
      },
      media: createMedia({
        xs: { maxWidth: 660 },
        sm: { maxWidth: 800 },
        md: { maxWidth: 1020 },
        lg: { maxWidth: 1280 },
        xl: { maxWidth: 1420 },
        xxl: { minWidth: 1420 + 1 },
        gtXs: { minWidth: 660 + 1 },
        gtSm: { minWidth: 800 + 1 },
        gtMd: { minWidth: 1020 + 1 },
        gtLg: { minWidth: 1280 + 1 },
        short: { maxHeight: 820 },
        tall: { minHeight: 820 },
        hoverNone: { hover: 'none' },
        pointerCoarse: { pointer: 'coarse' },
      }),
    })

    export type Conf = typeof config

    declare module 'tamagui' {
      interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
    }

    export default config
    ```

    This configuration defines a basic theme, fonts, and media queries. You can customize these values to match your design requirements. It's recommended to extend the base configuration with your own custom tokens and themes.

2.  **`_app.tsx` (Next.js) / `App.tsx` (Expo):**

    Wrap your application with the `TamaguiProvider` to make the Tamagui configuration available to all components.

    ```plaintext jsx
    // _app.tsx (Next.js)
    import React from 'react';
    import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui';
    import config from '../tamagui.config';
    import '../styles/globals.css'; // or your global styles

    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
      return (
        <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </TamaguiProvider>
      );
    }

    export default MyApp;
    ```

    ```plaintext jsx
    // App.tsx (Expo)
    import React from 'react';
    import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui';
    import config from './tamagui.config';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
          {/* Your App Content */}
        </TamaguiProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

3.  **Babel Configuration (if required):**

    Some setups might require Babel configuration to properly handle Tamagui's code transformation. Refer to the official Tamagui documentation for specific Babel configuration instructions based on your project setup (Next.js usually handles this automatically).

### Using Tamagui Components

Now that you have Tamagui installed and configured, you can start using its components in your application.

```plaintext jsx
import { YStack, HStack, Text, Button, styled } from 'tamagui';

const MyStyledButton = styled(Button, {
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: { padding: 8, fontSize: 12 },
      medium: { padding: 12, fontSize: 16 },
      large: { padding: 16, fontSize: 20 },
    },
    colorMode: {
      primary: { backgroundColor: '$blue5', color: 'white' },
      secondary: { backgroundColor: '$green5', color: 'white' },
    }
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'medium',
    colorMode: 'primary'
  }
});


function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <YStack gap="$4" alignItems="center">
      <Text size="$4">Hello, Tamagui!</Text>
      <MyStyledButton size="large" colorMode="secondary">Click Me</MyStyledButton>
      <HStack space="$2">
        <Text>This is inside a HStack</Text>
        <Text>And so is this</Text>
      </HStack>
    </YStack>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example:

- We import basic components like `YStack`, `HStack`, `Text`, and `Button` from `tamagui`. `YStack` and `HStack` provide flexbox layouts.
- We use styled components with the `styled` helper function to create custom, themed components. We define `variants` for size and color, showcasing the flexibility of the styling system.
- We use tokens (`$4`, `$blue5`, etc.) to refer to values defined in our theme.
- We use a predefined `Button` and apply our own styling via `styled`.

## The Power of Stacks: YStack, HStack, ZStack

Tamagui embraces the concept of "Stacks" for layout. These are pre-styled `View` components that simplify common layout tasks.

- **`YStack`:** A vertical stack, similar to `flexDirection: 'column'`.
- **`HStack`:** A horizontal stack, similar to `flexDirection: 'row'`.
- **`ZStack`:** A stack that layers elements on top of each other.

Stacks accept all the style props that a standard React Native `View` would, plus some Tamagui-specific ones. This allows you to quickly create complex layouts with minimal code.

## Theming and Customization

Tamagui's theming system, powered by Stitches, is incredibly powerful. You can customize almost every aspect of your UI to match your brand's identity.

1.  **Tokens:** Define reusable values for colors, spacing, fonts, and more in your `tamagui.config.ts` file. Tokens ensure consistency throughout your application. You can utilize the `createTokens` API to simplify token creation.

2.  **Themes:** Create multiple themes (e.g., light, dark) and switch between them dynamically.

3.  **Variants:** Define variations of components based on props or states (e.g., different button sizes or colors).

Here's an example of customizing themes in `tamagui.config.ts`:

```plaintext
// tamagui.config.ts
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'
import { createFont, createTheme, createMedia } from '@tamagui/core'
import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
import { themes } from '@tamagui/themes'
import { createTokens } from '@tamagui/theme-builder'

const myTokens = createTokens({
  colors: {
    blue1: '#f0f4ff',
    blue2: '#c6daff',
    blue3: '#94bbff',
    blue4: '#4f85ff',
    blue5: '#0057ff',
  },
  space: {
    0: 0,
    1: 4,
    2: 8,
    3: 12,
    4: 16,
    5: 20,
    6: 24,
  },
  size: {
    ...[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].reduce((acc, i) => {
      acc[i] = i * 4
      return acc
    }, {}),
  },
})

const config = createTamagui({
  defaultTheme: 'light',
  shouldAddPrefersColorThemes: true,
  themeClassNameOnRoot: true,
  tokens: myTokens,
  themes: {
    ...themes,
    dark: {
      ...themes.dark,
      background: myTokens.colors.blue5,
      color: 'white',
    },
    light: {
      ...themes.light,
      background: 'white',
      color: 'black',
    },
  },
  shorthands,
  fonts: {
    heading: createFont({
      family: 'System',
      size: {
        1: 12,
        2: 14,
        3: 16,
      },
    }),
    body: createFont({
      family: 'System',
      size: {
        1: 12,
        2: 14,
        3: 16,
      },
    }),
  },
  media: createMedia({
    xs: { maxWidth: 660 },
    sm: { maxWidth: 800 },
    md: { maxWidth: 1020 },
    lg: { maxWidth: 1280 },
    xl: { maxWidth: 1420 },
    xxl: { minWidth: 1420 + 1 },
    gtXs: { minWidth: 660 + 1 },
    gtSm: { minWidth: 800 + 1 },
    gtMd: { minWidth: 1020 + 1 },
    gtLg: { minWidth: 1280 + 1 },
    short: { maxHeight: 820 },
    tall: { minHeight: 820 },
    hoverNone: { hover: 'none' },
    pointerCoarse: { pointer: 'coarse' },
  }),
})

export type Conf = typeof config

declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends Conf {}
}

export default config
```

In this example, we define a custom theme and a few custom tokens. This theme overrides the default background and color for the "dark" theme. We use `createTokens` to easily create a bunch of sizes with a reducer. The advantage of using tokens is you get strong typing and auto-completion wherever you use it.

To switch themes in your application:

```plaintext jsx
import { useTheme } from 'tamagui';

function MyComponent() {
  const { theme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <YStack backgroundColor={theme.background} color={theme.color}>
      <Text>Current Theme: {theme.name}</Text>
    </YStack>
  );
}
```
