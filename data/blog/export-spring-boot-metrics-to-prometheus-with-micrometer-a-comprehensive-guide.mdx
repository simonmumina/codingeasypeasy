# Export Spring Boot Metrics to Prometheus with Micrometer: A Comprehensive Guide

Monitoring your Spring Boot applications is crucial for ensuring their health, performance, and stability. Prometheus, a leading open-source monitoring solution, coupled with Micrometer, a metrics instrumentation library, provides a powerful and flexible way to collect and analyze application metrics. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to integrate Micrometer with Spring Boot and export metrics to Prometheus.

## What is Micrometer?

Micrometer serves as a facade for various monitoring systems. It allows you to instrument your application code with vendor-neutral metrics and then choose the backend monitoring system you want to use without changing your code. Think of it as SLF4J, but for metrics. Key features include:

- **Vendor Neutrality:** Write metrics code once and export to various monitoring systems (Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, etc.).
- **Dimensional Metrics:** Metrics are tagged with dimensions, providing powerful filtering and aggregation capabilities.
- **Annotation-based Instrumentation:** Easily add metrics using annotations like `@Timed` and `@Counted`.
- **Spring Boot Auto-configuration:** Seamless integration with Spring Boot, simplifying the setup process.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It excels at collecting and storing metrics as time series data, recording information with a timestamp. Its key features include:

- **Time-Series Database:** Efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data.
- **Pull-Based Model:** Prometheus scrapes metrics endpoints from configured targets (like your Spring Boot application).
- **Powerful Query Language (PromQL):** Enables complex queries and aggregations of metrics data.
- **Alerting:** Define alerting rules based on metric thresholds.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle build tool
- Basic understanding of Spring Boot
- A running Prometheus instance (See the "Setting up Prometheus" section below for instructions)

## Step 1: Add Micrometer Dependencies to Your Spring Boot Project

Add the necessary Micrometer dependencies to your `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) file. Crucially, include both `micrometer-core` and `micrometer-registry-prometheus`.

**Maven (`pom.xml`):**

```plaintext
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Gradle (`build.gradle`):**

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-core'
    implementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'
}
```

**Explanation of Dependencies:**

- `spring-boot-starter-web`: Provides core Spring Web MVC functionality.
- `micrometer-core`: The core Micrometer library.
- `micrometer-registry-prometheus`: Prometheus registry implementation for Micrometer. This enables Micrometer to export metrics in a format Prometheus can understand.
- `spring-boot-starter-actuator`: Provides endpoints for monitoring and managing your application (including the metrics endpoint).

## Step 2: Configure Spring Boot Actuator to Expose the `/actuator/prometheus` Endpoint

Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in endpoints for monitoring and managing your application. To expose the metrics endpoint in Prometheus format, add the following configuration to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

**application.properties:**

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus,health,info
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
```

**application.yml:**

```plaintext
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: prometheus,health,info
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
```

**Explanation of Configuration:**

- `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus,health,info`: This setting exposes the `/actuator/prometheus`, `/actuator/health`, and `/actuator/info` endpoints. You can include other Actuator endpoints as needed (e.g., `/actuator/beans`, `/actuator/env`).
- `management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true`: This enables the export of metrics in Prometheus format.
- `management.endpoint.health.show-details=always`: This option ensures that the health endpoint shows detailed information, useful for more in-depth monitoring.

## Step 3: Instrument Your Code with Micrometer

Now you can start instrumenting your code with Micrometer annotations or programmatically using the `MeterRegistry`.

**Using Annotations:**

The `@Timed` annotation allows you to track the execution time of a method.

```plaintext
import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Timed;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Timed(value = "my.service.execution.time", description = "Time taken to execute the service method")
    public String doSomething() {
        // Simulate some work
        try {
            Thread.sleep(100);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        return "Done!";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `@Timed(value = "my.service.execution.time", description = "Time taken to execute the service method")`: This annotation automatically measures the execution time of the `doSomething()` method and registers it with the name `my.service.execution.time` and a descriptive text.

**Using the `MeterRegistry` Programmatically:**

You can also use the `MeterRegistry` directly to create and manage metrics.

```plaintext
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Counter;
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    private final Counter myCounter;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(MeterRegistry meterRegistry) {
        this.myCounter = meterRegistry.counter("my.service.calls");
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        myCounter.increment();
        // ... your service logic ...
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `@Autowired public MyService(MeterRegistry meterRegistry)`: Spring automatically injects the `MeterRegistry` instance.
- `this.myCounter = meterRegistry.counter("my.service.calls")`: This creates a `Counter` metric named `my.service.calls`. A `Counter` is a simple metric that increments.
- `myCounter.increment()`: Increments the counter each time the `doSomething()` method is called.

**Other Micrometer Meter Types:**

Besides `Timer` and `Counter`, Micrometer offers other meter types:

- **Gauge:** Represents a single numerical value that can go up or down. Useful for measuring current system state (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage).
- **DistributionSummary:** Records the distribution of events. Useful for understanding the range of values and percentiles.
- **LongTaskTimer:** Measures the duration of a long-running task.

## Step 4: Setting up Prometheus

If you don't already have Prometheus running, you can download and install it from the [Prometheus website](https://prometheus.io/download/).

After downloading, extract the archive and navigate to the extracted directory. You'll find a `prometheus.yml` file which is the main configuration file for Prometheus.

**Configuring Prometheus to Scrape Your Spring Boot Application:**

Edit the `prometheus.yml` file to add a new scrape configuration for your Spring Boot application. Replace `localhost:8080` with the actual host and port where your application is running.

```plaintext
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring-boot-app'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    scrape_interval: 5s # How often Prometheus scrapes the endpoint
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```

**Explanation of Prometheus Configuration:**

- `job_name: 'spring-boot-app'`: A descriptive name for the scrape job.
- `metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'`: The path to the Prometheus endpoint exposed by your Spring Boot application.
- `scrape_interval: 5s`: Specifies how often Prometheus should scrape the endpoint (every 5 seconds in this example). Adjust as needed.
- `static_configs`: Defines a list of target endpoints to scrape.
- `targets: ['localhost:8080']`: Specifies the host and port of your Spring Boot application.

**Starting Prometheus:**

Run Prometheus using the following command from the Prometheus directory:

```plaintext
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9090` (or the configured Prometheus address) to access the Prometheus UI.

## Step 5: Verify Metrics in Prometheus

After starting Prometheus and your Spring Boot application, you should be able to see the metrics in the Prometheus UI.

1.  Go to the Prometheus web interface (usually `http://localhost:9090`).
2.  In the query input field, type the name of one of the metrics you defined (e.g., `my_service_execution_time_seconds_count` or `my_service_calls_total`).
3.  Click "Execute" to see the metric data. You should see a graph representing the values of the metric over time.

You can use the Prometheus query language (PromQL) to perform more complex queries and aggregations. For example, to calculate the average execution time of your service, you could use a query like:

```promql
rate(my_service_execution_time_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(my_service_execution_time_seconds_count[5m])
```

## Step 6: (Optional) Configure Grafana for Visualization

While Prometheus provides a basic UI, Grafana is a popular open-source data visualization tool that can create more sophisticated dashboards and visualizations.

**Installing and Configuring Grafana:**

1.  Download and install Grafana from the [Grafana website](https://grafana.com/grafana/download).
2.  Start Grafana.
3.  Access Grafana in your web browser (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
4.  Log in with the default credentials (admin/admin).
5.  Add Prometheus as a data source:
    - Click on the "Configuration" (gear icon) in the left sidebar.
    - Click on "Data sources".
    - Click on "Add data source".
    - Select "Prometheus".
    - Enter the Prometheus server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`).
    - Click on "Save & Test".

**Creating a Dashboard in Grafana:**

1.  Click on the "+" icon in the left sidebar and select "Dashboard".
2.  Click on "Add new panel".
3.  Select Prometheus as the data source.
4.  Enter a PromQL query in the query editor (e.g., `my_service_execution_time_seconds_count`).
5.  Customize the panel settings (title, visualization type, etc.).
6.  Click "Apply" to save the panel.
7.  Repeat steps 2-6 to add more panels to your dashboard.

Grafana provides a rich set of visualization options, including graphs, gauges, tables, and more. You can use it to create dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of your application's performance and health.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Naming Conventions:** Use consistent and meaningful names for your metrics. Consider using a hierarchical naming structure (e.g., `service.name.operation.duration`).
- **Tagging (Dimensions):** Use tags to add context to your metrics. For example, you might tag metrics with the application name, environment, or instance ID.
- **Metric Types:** Choose the appropriate metric type for the data you are measuring. Using the wrong metric type can lead to inaccurate or misleading data.
- **Alerting:** Define alerting rules in Prometheus to notify you when metrics exceed certain thresholds. This allows you to proactively identify and address issues before they impact your users.
- **Security:** Secure your `/actuator` endpoints to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Consider using Spring Security to authenticate and authorize access to these endpoints.
- **Aggregation:** Be mindful of how your metrics will be aggregated. Counters and gauges are typically summed, while timers and distributions are aggregated using percentiles or averages.
- **Storage:** Ensure that your Prometheus instance has sufficient storage capacity to store your metrics data. You may need to configure retention policies to manage storage usage.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor the health and performance of your Prometheus and Grafana instances themselves.
- **Rate Calculations:** When working with counters, use the `rate()` function in PromQL to calculate the rate of change over time. This is often more useful than looking at the raw counter values.
- **Histogram vs. Summary:** Understand the difference between histograms and summaries when choosing a metric type for measuring distributions. Histograms are more efficient for aggregations in Prometheus, while summaries provide client-side percentiles.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can successfully integrate Micrometer with Spring Boot and export your application metrics to Prometheus. This will enable you to monitor your application's performance, identify potential issues, and improve its overall health and stability. Remember to explore the capabilities of Prometheus and Grafana to create powerful dashboards and alerting rules tailored to your specific needs. Observability is key to building resilient and reliable applications!
