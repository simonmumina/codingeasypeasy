# Deploy Web2py with Gunicorn or uWSGI: A Comprehensive Guide

Web2py is a powerful and easy-to-use Python web framework that simplifies web application development. While it includes a built-in development server, deploying to a production environment requires a more robust solution. Gunicorn and uWSGI are two popular WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) servers that can handle the load and provide the necessary features for a production-ready deployment. This guide will walk you through deploying your Web2py application using both Gunicorn and uWSGI, covering installation, configuration, and essential considerations.

## Why Use Gunicorn or uWSGI with Web2py?

The built-in Web2py server is primarily intended for development. For production deployments, Gunicorn and uWSGI offer several advantages:

- **Performance:** Gunicorn and uWSGI are designed to handle a high volume of requests concurrently, providing significantly better performance than the development server.
- **Scalability:** They can be configured to run multiple worker processes, allowing your application to utilize multiple CPU cores and scale to handle increased traffic.
- **Reliability:** They offer features like process monitoring and restarting, ensuring that your application remains available even if individual worker processes crash.
- **Security:** They can be configured to run behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache, providing added security and protection against attacks.
- **WSGI Compliance:** They adhere to the WSGI standard, providing a well-defined interface between the web server and your Web2py application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **A Web2py Application:** You should have a Web2py application ready to deploy. If you don't, create a simple one using `python web2py.py -c` and follow the prompts.
- **Python:** Python 2.7 or Python 3.x installed on your server.
- **pip:** The Python package installer.

## Deploying Web2py with Gunicorn

Gunicorn ("Green Unicorn") is a pure-Python WSGI server that is simple to configure and easy to use.

### 1. Install Gunicorn

Install Gunicorn using pip:

```plaintext
pip install gunicorn
```

### 2. Configure Gunicorn

Gunicorn requires minimal configuration. You'll typically create a `gunicorn.conf.py` file in your Web2py application directory or a dedicated configuration directory. Here's a sample configuration file:

```plaintext
# gunicorn.conf.py

import os

# Assuming your web2py application is in /path/to/web2py
web2py_path = "/path/to/web2py"  # Replace with your actual path
bind = "127.0.0.1:8000"  # Listen on localhost, port 8000
workers = 3  # Number of worker processes (adjust based on CPU cores)
timeout = 30  # Request timeout in seconds
# Access log path (optional)
accesslog = os.path.join(web2py_path, "logs", "gunicorn_access.log")
# Error log path (optional)
errorlog = os.path.join(web2py_path, "logs", "gunicorn_error.log")

#  Web2py specific setup. The important part.
chdir = web2py_path
pythonpath = web2py_path
wsgi_app = "wsgihandler:application"

# You might need to enable threads depending on your application's needs.
# threads = 2
```

**Explanation of Configuration Options:**

- `bind`: Specifies the address and port Gunicorn will listen on. We're using `127.0.0.1:8000` for testing. In a production environment, you'll likely bind to `0.0.0.0:80` or `0.0.0.0:443` (if using SSL) behind a reverse proxy.
- `workers`: The number of worker processes. A good starting point is the number of CPU cores plus one. Adjust this based on your application's load.
- `timeout`: The maximum time a worker process will wait for a request before being restarted.
- `accesslog` and `errorlog`: Optional paths for access and error logs. These are invaluable for debugging.
- `chdir`: The current working directory. Set this to the web2py directory.
- `pythonpath`: The PYTHONPATH to use. Set this to the web2py directory.
- `wsgi_app`: **Crucially important.** This specifies the WSGI application to run. `wsgihandler:application` tells Gunicorn to load the `application` object from the `wsgihandler.py` file located in the web2py directory. This is the standard Web2py WSGI entry point.

**Important:** Replace `/path/to/web2py` with the _actual_ path to your Web2py installation.

### 3. Start Gunicorn

Navigate to the directory containing your `gunicorn.conf.py` file (likely the Web2py directory). Then, start Gunicorn using the following command:

```plaintext
gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py
```

Or, if you don't want to use a config file, you can pass all the options on the command line:

```plaintext
gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 --workers 3 --chdir /path/to/web2py wsgihandler:application
```

Replace `/path/to/web2py` with your actual Web2py path.

### 4. Access Your Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see your Web2py application. If you're deploying to a server, replace `127.0.0.1` with your server's IP address.

### 5. Configure a Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

In a production environment, it's _highly recommended_ to use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache in front of Gunicorn. This provides several benefits, including:

- **SSL Termination:** Handling SSL encryption and decryption.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple Gunicorn workers.
- **Static File Serving:** Efficiently serving static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Security:** Hiding the internal workings of your application server.

Here's a basic Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com; # Replace with your domain

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; # Proxy to Gunicorn
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    # Serve static files directly (optional, but recommended)
    location /static/ {
        root /path/to/web2py/applications/your_app/static; #Replace with the right path
        expires 30d;
        access_log off;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }
}
```

**Important Notes for Nginx:**

- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
- Replace `/path/to/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py installation.
- Adjust the `/static/` location to point to the `static` directory within your specific Web2py application.
- Restart Nginx after making changes to the configuration: `sudo systemctl restart nginx` (or the appropriate command for your system).

## Deploying Web2py with uWSGI

uWSGI is another popular WSGI server known for its high performance and extensive features. It can be a bit more complex to configure than Gunicorn, but it offers greater flexibility.

### 1. Install uWSGI

Install uWSGI using pip:

```plaintext
pip install uwsgi
```

### 2. Configure uWSGI

uWSGI offers multiple ways to configure it, including command-line arguments, INI files, and XML files. We'll use an INI file for this example:

```plaintext
; uwsgi.ini

[uwsgi]
module = wsgihandler:application  ; Web2py WSGI application
chdir = /path/to/web2py          ; Web2py directory
pythonpath = /path/to/web2py
master = true                   ; Run in master mode
processes = 4                   ; Number of worker processes
socket = 127.0.0.1:3031         ; Socket to listen on
vacuum = true                    ; Clean up sockets on exit
die-on-term = true              ; Terminate when receiving SIGTERM
logto = /path/to/web2py/logs/uwsgi.log ; Log file (optional)
# enable-threads = true ; enable threads support (optional)
```

**Explanation of Configuration Options:**

- `module`: Specifies the WSGI application, similar to Gunicorn. `wsgihandler:application` points to the `application` object in `wsgihandler.py`.
- `chdir`: The Web2py directory.
- `pythonpath`: The PYTHONPATH to use. Set this to the web2py directory.
- `master`: Enables master process mode, which manages worker processes.
- `processes`: The number of worker processes.
- `socket`: The socket uWSGI will listen on. We're using a TCP socket here (`127.0.0.1:3031`). You can also use a Unix socket for improved performance if uWSGI and your reverse proxy are on the same server. A unix socket would look like this `/tmp/uwsgi.sock`.
- `vacuum`: Cleans up sockets on exit.
- `die-on-term`: Terminates when receiving a SIGTERM signal.
- `logto`: The path to the uWSGI log file (optional).
- `enable-threads`: Enable threads, which can be needed for some specific use cases in your Web2py application.

**Important:** Replace `/path/to/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py installation.

### 3. Start uWSGI

Navigate to the directory containing your `uwsgi.ini` file (likely the Web2py directory). Then, start uWSGI using the following command:

```plaintext
uwsgi --ini uwsgi.ini
```

### 4. Access Your Application

You won't be able to access your application directly in this configuration because uWSGI is listening on a socket. You need to configure a reverse proxy to forward requests to the uWSGI socket.

### 5. Configure a Reverse Proxy (Required)

Using a reverse proxy is _required_ with uWSGI because it listens on a socket, not directly on HTTP ports.

Here's an Nginx configuration that uses a TCP socket:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        include uwsgi_params; # Important!  Includes uWSGI parameter settings
        uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:3031;  # Forward requests to the uWSGI socket
    }

    location /static/ {
        root /path/to/web2py/applications/your_app/static; #Replace with the right path
        expires 30d;
        access_log off;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }
}
```

And here is an Nginx configuration if you're using a Unix socket:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        include uwsgi_params; # Important!  Includes uWSGI parameter settings
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/uwsgi.sock;  # Forward requests to the uWSGI socket
    }

    location /static/ {
        root /path/to/web2py/applications/your_app/static; #Replace with the right path
        expires 30d;
        access_log off;
        add_header Cache-Control "public";
    }
}
```

**Important Notes for Nginx:**

- **`include uwsgi_params;`**: This line is _crucial_. It includes a file (`uwsgi_params`) that contains the necessary parameters for communicating with uWSGI. Nginx usually includes this file in its configuration. If you don't have it, you'll need to create one (see below).
- Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
- Replace `/path/to/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py installation.
- Adjust the `/static/` location to point to the `static` directory within your specific Web2py application.
- Restart Nginx after making changes to the configuration: `sudo systemctl restart nginx` (or the appropriate command for your system).

**Creating `uwsgi_params` (If it's missing)**

If Nginx doesn't have the `uwsgi_params` file, you'll need to create it. Here's a typical `uwsgi_params` file:

```nginx
uwsgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
uwsgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
uwsgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
uwsgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH    $content_length;

uwsgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
uwsgi_param  PATH_INFO          $document_uri;
uwsgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;
uwsgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;
uwsgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
uwsgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;
uwsgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
uwsgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;

# you can pass arbitrary parameters to the uwsgi process
# setting the environment variables.
uwsgi_param  HTTP_SCHEME $scheme;
uwsgi_param  HTTPS if ($scheme = https) 1;
```

Place this file in a suitable location, such as `/etc/nginx/uwsgi_params` (or similar, depending on your system).

### 6. Access Your Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://yourdomain.com`. You should now see your Web2py application served through uWSGI and Nginx.

## Systemd Service Files (Recommended for Production)

For a robust production deployment, you should create systemd service files to manage Gunicorn or uWSGI. This allows your server to automatically start and restart your application on boot or after a crash.

### Gunicorn Systemd Service File (`gunicorn.service`)

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn application server for Web2py
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_user  # Replace with your user
Group=www-data    # Or your web server group
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/web2py
ExecStart=/path/to/virtualenv/bin/gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### uWSGI Systemd Service File (`uwsgi.service`)

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=uWSGI application server for Web2py
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_user # Replace with your user
Group=www-data # Or your web server group
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/web2py
ExecStart=/path/to/virtualenv/bin/uwsgi --ini uwsgi.ini
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Important Notes for Systemd Service Files:**

- **Replace `your_user` with the appropriate username** that has permissions to access your Web2py files.
- **Replace `www-data` with the web server group** that Nginx or Apache runs under (usually `www-data` on Debian/Ubuntu, `apache` on CentOS/RHEL).
- **Replace `/path/to/web2py` with the actual path to your Web2py installation.**
- **Replace `/path/to/virtualenv/bin/` with the path to your virtual environment**, if you're using one (recommended).
- Save the service file to `/etc/systemd/system/`.
- Enable and start the service:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.service  # or uwsgi.service
sudo systemctl start gunicorn.service   # or uwsgi.service
sudo systemctl status gunicorn.service  # or uwsgi.service - to check the status
```

## Virtual Environments (Highly Recommended)

It is strongly recommended to use virtual environments to isolate your Web2py application's dependencies. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your server.

```plaintext
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv  # or python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies within the virtual environment
pip install web2py gunicorn uwsgi
```

When creating your systemd service file, ensure that the `ExecStart` command uses the `gunicorn` or `uwsgi` executables located within your virtual environment.

## Web2py Configuration (Important Considerations)

- **Disable the Built-in Admin Interface (for Production):** The Web2py admin interface is a powerful tool, but it should be disabled in a production environment for security reasons. You can do this by deleting or renaming the `admin` application directory within your `applications` folder, or by modifying the `web2py.py` file.

- **Secure Configuration:** Ensure that your Web2py configuration (databases, secrets, etc.) is securely stored and not exposed publicly. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.

- **Logging:** Configure Web2py's logging system to write logs to a suitable location, and set up log rotation.

- **Static File Serving:** As mentioned earlier, offload static file serving to your reverse proxy (Nginx or Apache) for better performance. Web2py's built-in static file server is not designed for production use.

## Choosing Between Gunicorn and uWSGI

Both Gunicorn and uWSGI are excellent choices for deploying Web2py.

- **Gunicorn:** Simpler to configure and easier to get started with. A good choice for many Web2py applications.
- **uWSGI:** More complex but offers more flexibility and advanced features. May be a better choice for high-performance or resource-constrained environments.

Experiment with both to see which one works best for your specific needs.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided a comprehensive overview of deploying Web2py applications using Gunicorn and uWSGI. By following these steps and considering the important configuration aspects, you can ensure a robust, scalable, and secure production deployment of your Web2py applications. Remember to always prioritize security and follow best practices for server administration. Good luck!
