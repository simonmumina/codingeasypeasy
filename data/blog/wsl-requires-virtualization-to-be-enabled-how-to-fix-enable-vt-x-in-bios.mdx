# WSL Requires Virtualization to be Enabled: How to Fix (Enable VT-x in BIOS)

Encountering the frustrating error message "WSL requires virtualization to be enabled" when trying to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)? Don't worry, you're not alone! This is a common issue, and thankfully, it's usually straightforward to resolve. This detailed guide will walk you through the steps needed to enable virtualization (VT-x) in your BIOS/UEFI settings, troubleshoot potential Hyper-V conflicts, and get WSL up and running smoothly.

## Understanding the Error: Why WSL Needs Virtualization

The Windows Subsystem for Linux relies heavily on virtualization technology to create a lightweight virtual machine environment where Linux distributions can run seamlessly alongside Windows. Without virtualization enabled, WSL simply cannot function.

Think of it like this: WSL is a small apartment built *within* your Windows house. Virtualization is the foundation upon which that apartment is built. If the foundation is missing, the apartment can't exist.

Specifically, WSL uses Intel VT-x (Virtualization Technology) or AMD-V (AMD Virtualization) to create this virtual environment. These technologies allow your CPU to efficiently run multiple operating systems simultaneously.

## Step 1: Checking if Virtualization is Already Enabled

Before diving into BIOS settings, let's quickly check if virtualization is already enabled in Windows. Sometimes it's enabled in BIOS but disabled in Windows features.

**Option 1: Using Task Manager**

1.  Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
2.  Navigate to the "Performance" tab.
3.  Look for "Virtualization" near the bottom of the window.  It will say either "Enabled" or "Disabled".

**Option 2: Using System Information**

1.  Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog box.
2.  Type `msinfo32` and press Enter.
3.  In the System Information window, look for "Virtualization-based security".  If its state is "Running" then it is enabled at OS level. If its state is "Not Enabled" or the feature isn't present, continue.

If virtualization is already enabled (either in Task Manager or System Information), but you're still getting the error, skip to the "Troubleshooting Hyper-V Conflicts" section below.  Otherwise, proceed to enabling VT-x in your BIOS/UEFI.

## Step 2: Enabling VT-x (Virtualization Technology) in BIOS/UEFI

This is the most common solution.  The process varies slightly depending on your motherboard manufacturer, but the general steps are the same.

1.  **Restart Your Computer:**  Completely shut down and restart your computer.

2.  **Enter BIOS/UEFI Setup:**  During startup, watch for a message that tells you which key to press to enter the BIOS/UEFI setup.  Common keys include:

    *   `Del` (Delete)
    *   `F2`
    *   `F12`
    *   `Esc`
    *   `F1`

    The key to press is usually displayed very briefly during the boot sequence.  If you miss it, you may need to restart again. If you are on a Windows environment, you can also enter BIOS settings by following these steps: Settings -> Update & Security -> Recovery -> Advanced startup.

3.  **Navigate to CPU Configuration:** Once you're in the BIOS/UEFI setup, you'll need to find the CPU configuration settings.  This is often located under headings like:

    *   "Advanced"
    *   "CPU Configuration"
    *   "Chipset"
    *   "Configuration"

    Use your arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select options.  The layout and terminology will differ depending on your motherboard. Consult your motherboard's manual if you are having trouble finding the settings.

4.  **Find VT-x/AMD-V:**  Look for settings related to virtualization.  These settings might be labeled as:

    *   "Intel Virtualization Technology" (VT-x)
    *   "AMD-V" (AMD Virtualization)
    *   "Virtualization Technology"
    *   "SVM" (Secure Virtual Machine - AMD)

5.  **Enable Virtualization:**  Set the virtualization option to "Enabled".  It may currently be set to "Disabled".

6.  **Save and Exit:**  After enabling virtualization, find the "Save & Exit" or "Exit" option.  This will typically be located at the top or bottom of the screen.  Make sure to save your changes before exiting.

7.  **Restart Your Computer:**  Your computer will restart, and the changes you made in the BIOS/UEFI will take effect.

**Example BIOS Screens (Illustrative):**

*   **ASUS BIOS:**  You might find "Intel Virtualization Technology" under the "Advanced" -> "CPU Configuration" menu.

*   **Gigabyte BIOS:**  Look for "SVM Mode" under the "M.I.T." -> "Advanced Frequency Settings" or "Advanced CPU Core Settings" menu.

*   **MSI BIOS:**  You might find "Intel Virtualization Technology" under the "OC" (Overclocking) or "Settings" -> "Advanced" -> "CPU Features" menu.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Secure Boot:**  In some cases, enabling virtualization might interact with Secure Boot settings. If you experience issues after enabling virtualization, you may need to temporarily disable Secure Boot in your BIOS/UEFI settings.  However, re-enable Secure Boot after you've confirmed WSL is working.
*   **Consult Your Manual:** Your motherboard's manual is the best source of information for navigating your specific BIOS/UEFI.

## Step 3: Troubleshooting Hyper-V Conflicts

Even after enabling virtualization in your BIOS, you might still encounter the error if Hyper-V is interfering with WSL.  Hyper-V is Microsoft's native virtualization platform, and it can sometimes conflict with WSL's virtualization requirements.

**Scenario: Hyper-V is enabled but preventing WSL from starting**

If you've enabled Hyper-V (either intentionally or unintentionally), it might be blocking WSL from using the necessary virtualization resources.  To resolve this, you can disable Hyper-V or configure it to work alongside WSL.

**Option 1: Disable Hyper-V**

Disabling Hyper-V is often the simplest solution.

1.  **Open Control Panel:**  Search for "Control Panel" in the Windows search bar and open it.
2.  **Navigate to Programs:**  Click on "Programs" (or "Programs and Features" if you're in the Classic View).
3.  **Turn Windows Features On or Off:**  Click on "Turn Windows features on or off".
4.  **Uncheck Hyper-V:**  Find "Hyper-V" in the list and uncheck the box next to it.  This may require you to expand the "Hyper-V" option to uncheck all sub-components.
5.  **Restart Your Computer:**  Restart your computer to apply the changes.

**Option 2: Ensure HypervisorPlatform Feature is Enabled (Recommended for Windows 10+):**

With the changes in Windows 10 and Windows 11, it is typically recommended to enable the "HypervisorPlatform" feature as it is required for WSL2.  While Hyper-V itself might still be disabled, this platform allows WSL2 to function correctly.

1.  **Open an Administrator PowerShell:** Right click on the Windows Start Menu and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Terminal (Admin)".
2.  **Run the following command:**

    ```powershell
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform -NoRestart
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux -NoRestart
    ```

3.  **Restart your computer.**

**Why is HypervisorPlatform needed?**

The `HypervisorPlatform` feature provides the necessary hypervisor components for WSL2 to function.  WSL2 is built on a lightweight virtual machine, and this platform allows that virtual machine to run without requiring the full Hyper-V virtualization stack.

**Option 3: Configure Hyper-V for WSL (Advanced)**

This option is more complex and requires a deeper understanding of Hyper-V. It involves configuring Hyper-V to share resources with WSL, often through the use of virtual switches and network configurations.  This approach is generally not recommended for beginners.

## Step 4: Verify WSL is Working

After enabling virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI and resolving any Hyper-V conflicts, it's time to verify that WSL is working correctly.

1.  **Open PowerShell or Command Prompt:** Open either PowerShell or Command Prompt as an administrator.

2.  **Run the WSL command:**

    ```bash
    wsl --status
    ```

    If WSL is installed correctly, this command will display information about your WSL configuration, including the default distribution, WSL version, and kernel version.

3.  **If WSL is not installed:** if you get an error message indicating that WSL is not installed, you can install it by running the following command:

    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```

    This command will download and install the default Linux distribution (usually Ubuntu) and configure WSL.

4.  **Launch a Linux Distribution:** Once WSL is installed and configured, you can launch a Linux distribution by typing its name in PowerShell or Command Prompt. For example, if you installed Ubuntu, type:

    ```bash
    ubuntu
    ```

    This will open a Linux terminal within your Windows environment.

## Troubleshooting Further

If you've followed all the steps above and are still experiencing issues, here are some additional troubleshooting tips:

*   **Update Your BIOS/UEFI:**  An outdated BIOS/UEFI can sometimes cause compatibility issues. Check your motherboard manufacturer's website for the latest updates.
*   **Update Windows:**  Ensure you have the latest Windows updates installed.  This can resolve compatibility issues and improve WSL performance.
*   **Check for Conflicting Software:**  Some software, particularly virtualization tools like VirtualBox or VMware, can conflict with WSL.  Try disabling or uninstalling these tools temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.
*   **Review Error Messages:**  Pay close attention to any error messages you encounter. They often provide valuable clues about the root cause of the problem.
*   **Search Online Forums:**  Search online forums and communities related to WSL and Windows for similar issues and solutions.  Other users may have encountered the same problem and found a fix.
