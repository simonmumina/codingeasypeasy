# CSS Scroll-Behavior: Smooth Scrolling for Improved User Experience (Examples & Best Practices)

In today's web development landscape, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience is paramount. One simple yet powerful CSS property that significantly contributes to this is `scroll-behavior`. This property allows you to control whether scrolling transitions within your website are instantaneous or smooth. This blog post will delve into the intricacies of `scroll-behavior`, exploring its syntax, values, use cases, accessibility considerations, and best practices, complete with practical code examples.

## What is the CSS `scroll-behavior` Property?

The `scroll-behavior` CSS property specifies the scrolling behavior for a box when scrolling is initiated by the navigation or CSSOM scrolling APIs (like `scrollTo()` or setting `scrollTop`). Essentially, it determines whether the scrolling happens instantly or with a smooth animation.

## Syntax

The syntax for the `scroll-behavior` property is straightforward:

```plaintext
scroll-behavior: auto | smooth;
```

Let's break down the possible values:

- **`auto` (Default):** Specifies instantaneous scrolling. This is the browser's default behavior. The scroll position jumps immediately to the target element.
- **`smooth`:** Specifies smooth scrolling. The scroll position animates over time to the target element, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly transition.

## Practical Examples: Implementing `scroll-behavior`

Let's explore various scenarios where `scroll-behavior` can be applied and see how it enhances the user experience.

### 1. Basic Smooth Scrolling to Anchors

The most common use case is enabling smooth scrolling for internal links (anchors) on a webpage.

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Smooth Scrolling Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

    <section id="section1">
      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <p>Content of section 1...</p>
    </section>

    <section id="section2">
      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <p>Content of section 2...</p>
    </section>

    <section id="section3">
      <h2>Section 3</h2>
      <p>Content of section 3...</p>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```

**CSS (style.css):**

```plaintext
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

section {
  height: 500px; /* Add height to each section for scrolling */
  border: 1px solid black;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

In this example, we've applied `scroll-behavior: smooth;` to the `html` element. This ensures that _any_ scrolling initiated by clicking an anchor link within the page will be smooth. Clicking on "Section 1," "Section 2," or "Section 3" in the navigation will now result in a smooth scroll to the corresponding section. It's crucial to set a height (or sufficient content) to the sections so that there's something to scroll _to_.

### 2. Smooth Scrolling within a Specific Container

Sometimes, you might want to apply smooth scrolling only to a specific container element.

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<div class="scrollable-container">
  <a href="#item1">Item 1</a>
  <a href="#item2">Item 2</a>
  <a href="#item3">Item 3</a>

  <div id="item1">Item 1 Content</div>
  <div id="item2">Item 2 Content</div>
  <div id="item3">Item 3 Content</div>
</div>
```

**CSS:**

```plaintext
.scrollable-container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  overflow: auto; /* Enables scrolling */
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

#item1, #item2, #item3 {
  height: 150px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

Here, the `scroll-behavior: smooth;` is applied to the `.scrollable-container`. Only scrolling within this specific container will be smooth. The `overflow: auto` is essential to enable scrolling within the container.

### 3. Using JavaScript with `scroll-behavior`

You can also programmatically trigger smooth scrolling using JavaScript, which respects the `scroll-behavior` setting.

**HTML:**

```plaintext
<button id="scrollToTop">Scroll to Top</button>

<div style="height: 1000px;">Content to scroll through...</div>
```

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
const scrollToTopButton = document.getElementById('scrollToTop')

scrollToTopButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  window.scrollTo({
    top: 0,
    behavior: 'smooth', // This overrides the CSS setting if needed
  })
})
```

**CSS (optional - for default smooth behavior):**

```plaintext
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

In this example, the JavaScript code uses the `window.scrollTo()` method. By setting the `behavior` property to `smooth`, we ensure that the scroll to the top of the page is animated smoothly. If `scroll-behavior` is already set to `smooth` in the CSS, you can omit the `behavior` property in the JavaScript code. However, specifying it explicitly in JavaScript gives you more control and can override the CSS setting if required.

### 4. Overriding Default Behavior with `auto`

Let's say you generally want smooth scrolling on your entire page, but you need to disable it for a specific element.

**CSS:**

```plaintext
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

#special-section {
  scroll-behavior: auto; /* Disable smooth scrolling for this section */
}
```

This allows you to have smooth scrolling globally, while selectively disabling it for specific elements. This can be useful for scenarios where immediate scrolling is preferred (e.g., for performance reasons or specific UI interactions).

## Accessibility Considerations

While smooth scrolling enhances the user experience, it's crucial to consider accessibility:

- **Respect User Preferences:** Users may have preferences set in their operating system or browser to disable animations for accessibility reasons. Browsers will generally respect these settings and disable smooth scrolling even if `scroll-behavior: smooth` is specified.
- **Motion Sensitivity:** Some users are sensitive to motion and may experience nausea or dizziness from smooth scrolling. Provide a mechanism for users to disable smooth scrolling on your website. This could be a simple toggle button or checkbox.
- **Focus Management:** Ensure that when scrolling to a new section, the focus is correctly placed on a relevant element within that section. This is especially important for keyboard users and screen reader users.

## Best Practices for Using `scroll-behavior`

- **Use Judiciously:** While smooth scrolling can be beneficial, avoid overuse. Too much animation can be distracting and negatively impact the user experience. Use it strategically where it adds value.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your website with smooth scrolling enabled on various devices and browsers to ensure it works as expected and doesn't introduce any performance issues.
- **Consider Performance:** While the impact is usually minimal, smooth scrolling can slightly affect performance, especially on older devices. Monitor your website's performance and optimize if necessary.
- **Prioritize Accessibility:** Always prioritize accessibility when implementing smooth scrolling. Ensure that it doesn't create any barriers for users with disabilities.
- **Combine with other scrolling techniques:** Use scroll-snap-type with scroll-behavior to create a modern and easy-to-navigate website.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome
