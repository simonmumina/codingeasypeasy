# How to Kill Stuck YARN Jobs in Hadoop: A Comprehensive Guide

Running Hadoop jobs can sometimes lead to unexpected situations. One common problem is encountering jobs that get stuck and refuse to complete. These stuck jobs can consume valuable resources and hinder the overall performance of your Hadoop cluster. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to identify and kill stuck YARN jobs, ensuring efficient resource utilization and a healthy cluster.

## Understanding YARN and Job Lifecycle

Before diving into the methods of killing jobs, let's briefly understand YARN and the typical job lifecycle within a Hadoop cluster.

**YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):** YARN is the resource management layer in Hadoop 2.x and beyond. It allows multiple data processing engines (e.g., MapReduce, Spark, Flink) to run concurrently within a single cluster.

**Job Lifecycle:** A YARN job typically goes through the following stages:

1.  **Submission:** The client submits the job to the Resource Manager.
2.  **Application Master Launch:** The Resource Manager launches an Application Master, which is responsible for managing the application's lifecycle.
3.  **Resource Negotiation:** The Application Master negotiates with the Resource Manager for resources (containers) to run the tasks.
4.  **Task Execution:** The Application Master launches tasks within the allocated containers.
5.  **Completion:** Upon successful completion of all tasks, the Application Master notifies the Resource Manager, and the job is marked as completed.

A job might get stuck at any of these stages due to various reasons such as:

- **Data Skew:** Uneven distribution of data can cause some tasks to take significantly longer than others.
- **Code Bugs:** Errors in the job's code can lead to infinite loops or unexpected behavior.
- **Resource Contention:** Insufficient resources can cause tasks to wait indefinitely.
- **Node Failures:** Failure of a NodeManager can disrupt task execution.
- **Network Issues:** Network problems can prevent communication between the Application Master and the NodeManagers.

## Methods for Killing Stuck YARN Jobs

Here are several methods for killing stuck YARN jobs, ordered by common usage and ease of implementation:

### 1. Using the YARN Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The YARN CLI is the most common and straightforward way to kill a YARN job. You'll primarily use the `yarn application -kill` command.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify the Application ID:** The first step is to identify the Application ID of the stuck job. You can find this using the `yarn application -list` command.

    ```bash
    yarn application -list
    ```

    This command will output a list of running applications, along with their IDs, states, and other information. Look for the job that is stuck. For example:

    ```
    Total applications:2
    State      ApplicationId                                Name                                                     ApplicationType       User       Queue      StartTime          FinishTime         Progress       FinalStatus
    RUNNING      application_1698489600000_0001             WordCount                                                MAPREDUCE           user1      default    1698489605000      N/A                0.5            UNDEFINED
    ACCEPTED     application_1698489600000_0002             SparkPi                                                  SPARK               user2      default    1698489610000      N/A                0.0            UNDEFINED
    ```

    In this example, let's say `application_1698489600000_0001` (WordCount) is the stuck job.

2.  **Kill the Job:** Once you have the Application ID, use the `yarn application -kill` command to kill the job.

    ```bash
    yarn application -kill application_1698489600000_0001
    ```

    This command sends a kill signal to the Application Master of the specified job. You should see a confirmation message like this:

    ```
    Killing application application_1698489600000_0001
    ```

3.  **Verify Job Termination:** After killing the job, you can verify its termination using the `yarn application -status` command.

    ```bash
    yarn application -status application_1698489600000_0001
    ```

    The output should indicate that the application state is `KILLED` or `FAILED`.

**Example Script (Bash):**

This script automates the process of listing running applications and killing a specific application based on its name (useful for repeated tasks).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to list YARN applications and kill one based on name

APP_NAME="$1"  # Application name as the first argument

if [ -z "$APP_NAME" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <application_name>"
  exit 1
fi

APP_ID=$(yarn application -list | awk -v app_name="$APP_NAME" '$0 ~ app_name {print $2}')

if [ -z "$APP_ID" ]; then
  echo "Application with name '$APP_NAME' not found."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Killing application with ID: $APP_ID and name: $APP_NAME"
yarn application -kill "$APP_ID"

echo "Verifying application status..."
yarn application -status "$APP_ID"
```

**How to use this script:**

1.  Save the script to a file, e.g., `kill_yarn_app.sh`.
2.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x kill_yarn_app.sh`.
3.  Run the script with the application name as an argument: `./kill_yarn_app.sh WordCount`

### 2. Using the Hadoop Resource Manager UI

The Hadoop Resource Manager UI provides a graphical interface for monitoring and managing YARN applications.

**Steps:**

1.  **Access the Resource Manager UI:** Open your web browser and navigate to the Resource Manager UI. The address is typically `http://<resource_manager_host>:8088`. Replace `<resource_manager_host>` with the hostname or IP address of your Resource Manager node.

2.  **Identify the Stuck Job:** The UI displays a list of running and completed applications. Identify the stuck job based on its name or Application ID. Look for jobs with a long runtime or low progress.

3.  **Kill the Job:** Click on the Application ID of the stuck job. This will take you to the application's details page. On this page, you should find a "Kill Application" button. Click this button to kill the job.

4.  **Confirm Termination:** After clicking "Kill Application," the job's state should change to `KILLED`.

**Advantages:**

- User-friendly interface.
- Provides detailed information about each application.
- Suitable for visual monitoring and ad-hoc job management.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires web browser access to the Resource Manager.
- Less efficient for automating tasks.

### 3. Using the Hadoop REST API

The Hadoop Resource Manager also provides a REST API that you can use to programmatically manage YARN applications. This is useful for automating tasks or integrating with other monitoring and management tools.

**Steps:**

1.  **Construct the API Endpoint:** The endpoint for killing an application is:

    ```
    http://<resource_manager_host>:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps/<application_id>/state
    ```

    Replace `<resource_manager_host>` with the hostname or IP address of your Resource Manager node, and `<application_id>` with the Application ID of the stuck job.

2.  **Send the Kill Request:** Use a tool like `curl` or `wget` to send a PUT request to the API endpoint with the following JSON payload:

    ```json
    {
      "state": "KILLED"
    }
    ```

    Example using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "KILLED"}' http://<resource_manager_host>:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps/<application_id>/state
    ```

3.  **Verify Job Termination:** You can verify the job's termination by using the `yarn application -status` command or by checking the application status in the Resource Manager UI.

**Example Script (Python):**

This script uses the Python `requests` library to kill a YARN application via the REST API.

```plaintext
import requests
import json

def kill_yarn_application(resource_manager_host, application_id):
    """Kills a YARN application using the Hadoop Resource Manager REST API."""

    url = f"http://{resource_manager_host}:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps/{application_id}/state"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    data = json.dumps({"state": "KILLED"})

    try:
        response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, data=data)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        print(f"Successfully killed application: {application_id}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error killing application {application_id}: {e}")
        return False
    return True


if __name__ == "__main__":
    resource_manager_host = "your_resource_manager_host"  # Replace with your Resource Manager hostname/IP
    application_id = "application_1698489600000_0001"  # Replace with the Application ID you want to kill

    if kill_yarn_application(resource_manager_host, application_id):
        print("Application kill request sent.")
    else:
        print("Failed to send application kill request.")
```

**How to use this script:**

1.  Replace `your_resource_manager_host` and `application_id` with the appropriate values.
2.  Make sure you have the `requests` library installed: `pip install requests`.
3.  Run the script: `python kill_yarn_app.py`.

**Advantages:**

- Automation and integration capabilities.
- Suitable for programmatic management of YARN applications.

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires knowledge of REST APIs and programming.
- More complex to set up than the YARN CLI or Resource Manager UI.

### 4. Killing Individual Tasks (Advanced - Usually Not Necessary)

In rare cases, a single stuck task within a job might be the problem. While directly killing individual tasks is generally not supported via a simple command, identifying the problematic task and potentially blacklisting the node it's running on can sometimes help. This is an advanced technique and should only be used as a last resort.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify the Task ID:** Use the Resource Manager UI or the YARN CLI (`yarn logs -applicationId <application_id>`) to examine the logs and identify the task that is consistently failing or stuck. Task IDs have a specific format, such as `task_1698489600000_0001_m_000001`.

2.  **Identify the NodeManager:** From the logs, determine which NodeManager the task is running on. The logs should contain information about the host.

3.  **Blacklisting the Node (Caution):** If you suspect the NodeManager itself is faulty, you _might_ consider blacklisting it. **However, blacklisting should be done with extreme caution** as it will prevent any tasks from running on that node. Blacklisting is typically configured within the Hadoop configuration files (`yarn-site.xml` or `mapred-site.xml`) and requires a restart of the affected services. Consult your Hadoop documentation for the specific procedure.

**Why this is a last resort:**

- Killing a single task is not directly supported by YARN commands.
- Blacklisting a node can significantly impact cluster resource utilization.
- The underlying problem might be with the job logic, not the specific task or node.

## Troubleshooting Stuck YARN Jobs

Before resorting to killing a YARN job, it's crucial to investigate the root cause of the problem. Here are some troubleshooting tips:

- **Check the Application Logs:** Examine the application logs for errors, warnings, or exceptions. This can provide valuable insights into why the job is stuck. Use the `yarn logs -applicationId <application_id>` command to access the logs.
- **Monitor Resource Utilization:** Use the Resource Manager UI to monitor the CPU, memory, and disk I/O utilization of the NodeManagers. Resource contention can cause jobs to get stuck.
- **Analyze Data Skew:** Check for data skew, which can cause some tasks to take significantly longer than others. This is especially relevant for MapReduce jobs.
- **Review Job Configuration:** Verify that the job is configured correctly, with appropriate memory and CPU allocations.
- **Examine Network Connectivity:** Check for network issues that might be preventing communication between the Application Master and the NodeManagers.
- **Check NodeManager Health:** Ensure that all NodeManagers are healthy and functioning correctly. Look for any errors or warnings in the NodeManager logs.

## Best Practices for Preventing Stuck YARN Jobs

- **Write Efficient Code:** Optimize your MapReduce, Spark, or other data processing jobs to minimize resource consumption and execution time.
- **Handle Data Skew:** Implement techniques to handle data skew, such as pre-partitioning or using combiner functions.
- **Monitor Job Progress:** Regularly monitor the progress of your jobs and identify potential problems early on.
- **Set Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate resource limits for each job to prevent resource contention.
- **Use a Resource Scheduler:** Utilize a resource scheduler (e.g., Capacity Scheduler, Fair Scheduler) to manage resource allocation within the cluster.
- **Regularly Update Hadoop:** Keep your Hadoop cluster up-to-date with the latest security patches and bug fixes.
