# Flask Multiple Databases: Connect & Manage Connections with SQLAlchemy

When building larger Flask applications, you might encounter scenarios where you need to connect to and interact with multiple databases. This could be for various reasons, such as:

- **Separating concerns:** Isolating data for different application modules or features.
- **Legacy systems:** Integrating with existing databases that you cannot migrate.
- **Microservices architecture:** Each microservice might have its own database.
- **Reporting and analytics:** Connecting to a separate read-only database for reporting purposes.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of setting up and managing multiple database connections in your Flask application using SQLAlchemy, a powerful and flexible Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).

## Why SQLAlchemy?

While you could directly use database drivers like `psycopg2` (for PostgreSQL) or `mysql.connector` (for MySQL), SQLAlchemy offers several advantages:

- **Abstraction:** Provides an abstraction layer that simplifies database interaction and makes your code more database-agnostic. You can switch between databases with minimal code changes.
- **ORM Features:** Allows you to work with Python objects instead of raw SQL queries, making your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Connection Pooling:** Manages database connections efficiently, reducing the overhead of creating and closing connections frequently.
- **Security:** Helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by providing parameterized queries.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+:** Ensure you have a recent version of Python installed.
- **Flask:** Install Flask using `pip install Flask`
- **SQLAlchemy:** Install SQLAlchemy using `pip install SQLAlchemy`
- **Database Drivers:** Install the necessary database drivers for the databases you intend to use (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, `mysqlclient` for MySQL).

## Setting Up Your Flask Project

Let's start by creating a basic Flask project structure:

```
my_flask_app/
├── app.py
├── config.py
├── models/
│   ├── db1_models.py
│   └── db2_models.py
└── requirements.txt
```

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for the application, including database connection URLs.
- `models/`: Directory to store SQLAlchemy model definitions, separated by database. This is a suggested structure, you can adapt it to your needs.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.

## Configure Your Flask Application (config.py)

In your `config.py` file, define the database connection URLs. This is where you specify the database type, host, port, username, password, and database name.

```plaintext
import os

class Config:
    DEBUG = True  # Enable debugging mode

    # Database 1 Configuration (e.g., PostgreSQL)
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI_DB1 = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL_DB1') or 'postgresql://user:password@host:port/database1'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False  # Disable SQLAlchemy modification tracking

    # Database 2 Configuration (e.g., MySQL)
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI_DB2 = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL_DB2') or 'mysql+pymysql://user:password@host/database2'
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Environment Variables:** Using `os.environ.get()` is highly recommended. This allows you to configure your database connections through environment variables, which is more secure and flexible, especially in production environments.
- **Security:** Never hardcode sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly into your code. Use environment variables or a more secure configuration management system.
- **Database URL Format:** Ensure your database URLs are in the correct format for your chosen database drivers. Refer to the SQLAlchemy documentation for the correct format. For example, `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name` for PostgreSQL using `psycopg2` and `mysql+pymysql://user:password@host/database_name` for MySQL using `pymysql`.
- **SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS:** It's generally recommended to set `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS` to `False` unless you specifically need to track changes made to SQLAlchemy objects. It can add overhead and is not always necessary.

## Initialize SQLAlchemy in Your Flask Application (app.py)

In your `app.py` file, create the Flask application instance and configure SQLAlchemy. The key is to create separate `SQLAlchemy` instances for each database.

```plaintext
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from config import Config

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)

# Initialize SQLAlchemy for database 1
db1 = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Initialize SQLAlchemy for database 2
db2 = SQLAlchemy(app)


# You might also need to bind an app context if not using Flask-Migrate
with app.app_context():
    pass

# Import models *after* creating the db instances to avoid circular imports
from models import db1_models, db2_models
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Necessary Modules:** Import `Flask`, `SQLAlchemy`, and your `Config` class.
2.  **Create Flask App:** Create a Flask application instance (`app = Flask(__name__)`).
3.  **Load Configuration:** Load the configuration from your `config.py` file (`app.config.from_object(Config)`).
4.  **Initialize SQLAlchemy (Multiple Instances):** This is the crucial part. Create separate `SQLAlchemy` instances (`db1` and `db2`) and pass the Flask app instance to each one. Each instance will be configured with its respective database URL.
5.  **App Context:** The `with app.app_context():` block ensures that the code inside it runs within the context of your Flask application. This is often necessary for operations that depend on the Flask application being initialized. It is especially needed if you are running database migrations or performing certain operations outside a request context.
6.  **Import Models:** Import your model definitions _after_ initializing the `SQLAlchemy` instances. This prevents circular import issues.

## Define Your Models (models/db1_models.py and models/db2_models.py)

Now, define your database models in separate files within the `models` directory. Each model will be associated with a specific `SQLAlchemy` instance (either `db1` or `db2`).

**models/db1_models.py:**

```plaintext
from app import db1

class User(db1.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = db1.Column(db1.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db1.Column(db1.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db1.Column(db1.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<User {self.username}>'
```

**models/db2_models.py:**

```plaintext
from app import db2

class Product(db2.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'products'
    id = db2.Column(db2.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db2.Column(db2.String(100), nullable=False)
    price = db2.Column(db2.Float, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Product {self.name}>'
```

**Key Points:**

- **Import the Correct `db` Instance:** Ensure you import the correct `db` instance (`db1` or `db2`) from your `app.py` file. This is how you associate the model with the correct database connection.
- **`__tablename__`:** Define the table name using the `__tablename__` attribute.
- **Column Definitions:** Define the columns of your table using `db.Column()`, specifying the data type (e.g., `db.Integer`, `db.String`, `db.Float`), constraints (e.g., `primary_key=True`, `unique=True`, `nullable=False`), and other options.

## Creating and Managing the Databases

You'll need to create the databases and tables in your database servers. You can do this in a few ways:

**1. Manually (Not Recommended for Production):**

You can use the command-line tools for your database (e.g., `psql` for PostgreSQL, `mysql` for MySQL) to create the databases and tables based on your model definitions. This is generally not recommended for production environments as it's error-prone and difficult to automate.

**2. SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` (For Development/Testing):**

For development and testing, you can use SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` method to create the tables based on your model definitions. However, be very cautious about using this in production, as it can be destructive if you're not careful.

```plaintext
from app import app, db1, db2
from models import db1_models, db2_models

with app.app_context():
    db1.create_all()
    db2.create_all()
```

**Important:**

- Run this code only once to create the tables.
- Be extremely careful when using `create_all()` in production environments, as it can overwrite existing tables.

**3. Flask-Migrate (Recommended for Production):**

Flask-Migrate is an extension that makes it easy to manage database migrations in your Flask application. It allows you to track changes to your database schema and apply them in a controlled and predictable way.

**Installation:**

```plaintext
pip install Flask-Migrate
```

**Configuration and Usage:**

1.  **Initialize Flask-Migrate:**

    ```plaintext
    from flask import Flask
    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from flask_migrate import Migrate
    from config import Config

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(Config)

    db1 = SQLAlchemy(app)
    db2 = SQLAlchemy(app)

    migrate1 = Migrate(app, db1, render_as_batch=True, directory="migrations/db1")
    migrate2 = Migrate(app, db2, render_as_batch=True, directory="migrations/db2")

    # Import models after creating db instances
    from models import db1_models, db2_models
    ```

    - Initialize `Migrate` separately for each `db` instance, providing a different `directory` for each database's migrations. The `render_as_batch=True` argument can help avoid issues with SQLite constraints.

2.  **Create Initial Migrations:**

    Use the Flask CLI to create initial migrations for each database:

    ```plaintext
    flask db migrate -n db1 -d migrations/db1 -m "Initial migration for database 1"
    flask db migrate -n db2 -d migrations/db2 -m "Initial migration for database 2"
    ```

    (If you're using Flask < 2.0, replace `flask` with `python app.py`)

3.  **Apply Migrations:**

    Apply the migrations to create the tables in your databases:

    ```plaintext
    flask db upgrade -n db1 -d migrations/db1
    flask db upgrade -n db2 -d migrations/db2
    ```

4.  **Making Changes to Models:**

    Whenever you change your models, create a new migration and apply it:

    ```plaintext
    flask db migrate -n db1 -d migrations/db1 -m "Added new column to User model"
    flask db upgrade -n db1 -d migrations/db1

    flask db migrate -n db2 -d migrations/db2 -m "Updated Product model"
    flask db upgrade -n db2 -d migrations/db2
    ```

Flask-Migrate provides a much more robust and reliable way to manage your database schema, especially in production environments. It's highly recommended to use it.

## Working with Multiple Databases in Your Application

Now that you have your databases set up, you can start using them in your Flask application.

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, render_template
from app import app, db1, db2
from models.db1_models import User
from models.db2_models import Product

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Query users from database 1
    users = User.query.all()

    # Query products from database 2
    products = Product.query.all()

    return render_template('index.html', users=users, products=products)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Import Models:** Import the models you want to use from their respective files.
- **Query Databases:** Use the `query` attribute of the model class to query the database. Since each model is associated with a specific `db` instance, the queries will be executed against the correct database.
- **Use Sessions (Implicit):** SQLAlchemy uses sessions to manage database interactions. In Flask, with `SQLAlchemy`, a session is automatically created for each request and torn down at the end of the request. You don't typically need to manage sessions explicitly in simple cases. The `db1.session` and `db2.session` are used behind the scenes by the ORM, and the `db.session.commit()` and `db.session.rollback()` are automatically handled (or, you can commit explicitly where needed).

**Adding Data:**

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
from app import app, db1, db2
from models.db1_models import User
from models.db2_models import Product

@app.route('/add_user', methods=['POST'])
def add_user():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        email = request.form['email']
        new_user = User(username=username, email=email)
        db1.session.add(new_user)
        db1.session.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('index'))

@app.route('/add_product', methods=['POST'])
def add_product():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['name']
        price = float(request.form['price'])
        new_product = Product(name=name, price=price)
        db2.session.add(new_product)
        db2.session.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('index'))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Necessary Modules:** Import `request` and `redirect`.
2.  **Handle Form Submissions:** Create routes to handle form submissions for adding users and products.
3.  **Create New Objects:** Create new instances of your model classes with data from the form.
4.  **Add to Session:** Use `db.session.add()` to add the new object to the SQLAlchemy session. The appropriate session (`db1.session` or `db2.session`) is used based on the model.
5.  **Commit Changes:** Use `db.session.commit()` to commit the changes to the database.
6.  **Redirect:** Redirect the user back to the index page after adding the data.

## Connection Pooling

SQLAlchemy automatically manages connection pooling for you. By default, it uses a pool of connections that are reused for subsequent requests. This improves performance by reducing the overhead of creating and closing database connections frequently.

You can customize the connection pool settings using the `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE`, `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT`, `SQLALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE`, and `SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW` configuration options in your `config.py` file. Refer to the SQLAlchemy documentation for details on these options.

## Best Practices

- **Separate Models:** Keep your model definitions organized by placing them in separate files or directories for each database.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store database connection details in environment variables for security and flexibility.
- **Use Flask-Migrate:** Manage database schema changes using Flask-Migrate.
- **Connection Pooling:** Understand and tune SQLAlchemy's connection pooling settings for optimal performance.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch database connection errors and other exceptions.
- **Transactions:** For complex operations involving multiple database updates, use transactions to ensure data consistency.
- **Choose the Right Database:** Select the appropriate database technology for your specific needs. NoSQL databases like MongoDB might be a better fit for certain use cases.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided a comprehensive overview of how to use multiple databases in your Flask application using SQLAlchemy. By following these steps, you can effectively manage connections to multiple databases, separate your data, and build more scalable and maintainable applications. Remember to prioritize security, use Flask-Migrate for schema management, and optimize your connection pooling settings for performance.
