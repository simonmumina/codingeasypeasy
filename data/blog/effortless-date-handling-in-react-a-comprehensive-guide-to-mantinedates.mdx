# Effortless Date Handling in React: A Comprehensive Guide to @mantine/dates

Managing dates and times in web applications can be a complex task. Fortunately, libraries like `@mantine/dates` provide a robust and easy-to-use solution for React developers. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively utilize `@mantine/dates` in your projects, covering basic datepicker implementations, advanced customization options, and date range selection.

## What is @mantine/dates?

`@mantine/dates` is a part of the Mantine UI library, a full-featured React components library focused on providing developers with ready-to-use, accessible, and highly customizable components. The `@mantine/dates` package specifically handles date and time input and selection, offering a range of components designed to simplify the process of integrating date functionality into your React applications.

## Why Use @mantine/dates?

*   **Ease of Use:**  `@mantine/dates` provides simple and intuitive components that are easy to integrate into existing React projects.
*   **Customization:**  The library is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the appearance and behavior of date pickers to match your application's design.
*   **Accessibility:** Mantine components, including those in `@mantine/dates`, are designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring your applications are usable by everyone.
*   **Comprehensive Functionality:**  Offers components for date selection, date range selection, and more, covering a wide range of date-related use cases.
*   **TypeScript Support:** Built with TypeScript, `@mantine/dates` provides excellent type safety and code completion, improving developer experience and reducing errors.
*   **Mantine Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Mantine components for a consistent and cohesive user experience.

## Getting Started with @mantine/dates

### Installation

First, you need to install the `@mantine/dates` package alongside `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks`. Also, you will need `date-fns` as `@mantine/dates` uses it internally:

```bash
npm install @mantine/dates @mantine/core @mantine/hooks date-fns
# or
yarn add @mantine/dates @mantine/core @mantine/hooks date-fns
# or
pnpm add @mantine/dates @mantine/core @mantine/hooks date-fns
```

### Basic Datepicker Implementation

The most basic use case is a simple date picker. Here's how to implement one using the `DatePicker` component:

```jsx
import { DatePicker } from '@mantine/dates';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(null);

  return (
    <DatePicker
      label="Select a date"
      value={date}
      onChange={setDate}
    />
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This code snippet creates a date picker with a label "Select a date". The selected date is stored in the `date` state variable, and the `onChange` prop is used to update the state when a new date is selected.

### Styling and Theming

Mantine provides a powerful theming system. You can customize the appearance of the `DatePicker` and other components to match your application's design. Here's how you can use the `theme` prop to customize the date picker:

```jsx
import { DatePicker, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/dates';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(null);

  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={{
      colors: {
        myColor: ['#E9E9E9', '#D1D1D1', '#B9B9B9', '#A1A1A1', '#8A8A8A', '#737373', '#5C5C5C', '#464646', '#2F2F2F', '#191919'],
      },
      primaryColor: 'myColor',
    }}>
      <DatePicker
        label="Select a date"
        value={date}
        onChange={setDate}
      />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This example overrides the primary color of the DatePicker to `myColor`. You can customize other aspects of the component, such as font size, border radius, and more, using the `theme` prop.

### Advanced Customization

The `DatePicker` component offers several props for advanced customization.  Here are a few examples:

*   **`placeholder`:**  Sets the placeholder text when no date is selected.
*   **`clearable`:**  Adds a clear button to remove the selected date.
*   **`disabled`:**  Disables the date picker.
*   **`minDate` and `maxDate`:**  Sets the minimum and maximum selectable dates.
*   **`excludeDate`:** A function that determines whether a date should be excluded from selection.

Here's an example demonstrating some of these features:

```jsx
import { DatePicker } from '@mantine/dates';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { subDays, addDays } from 'date-fns';

function MyComponent() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(null);

  const isWeekend = (date) => date.getDay() === 0 || date.getDay() === 6;

  return (
    <DatePicker
      label="Select a date"
      placeholder="Pick a date"
      value={date}
      onChange={setDate}
      clearable
      minDate={subDays(new Date(), 7)}
      maxDate={addDays(new Date(), 7)}
      excludeDate={isWeekend}
    />
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example:

*   A placeholder "Pick a date" is added.
*   A clear button is added.
*   The selectable dates are limited to the past and future 7 days.
*   Weekends (Saturday and Sunday) are excluded from selection.

### Date Range Selection

`@mantine/dates` also provides the `DateRangePicker` component for selecting a date range. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
import { DateRangePicker } from '@mantine/dates';
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [dates, setDates] = useState([null, null]);

  return (
    <DateRangePicker
      label="Select a date range"
      value={dates}
      onChange={setDates}
    />
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

The `DateRangePicker` component works similarly to the `DatePicker` component, but it allows the user to select a start and end date. The selected dates are stored in an array `[startDate, endDate]`.

### Formatting Dates

`@mantine/dates` leverages `date-fns` for date formatting.  You can use `date-fns` functions to format the selected date(s) as needed.

```jsx
import { DatePicker } from '@mantine/dates';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { format } from 'date-fns';

function MyComponent() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(null);

  const formattedDate = date ? format(date, 'MMMM dd, yyyy') : 'No date selected';

  return (
    <>
      <DatePicker
        label="Select a date"
        value={date}
        onChange={setDate}
      />
      <p>Selected date: {formattedDate}</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This example formats the selected date as "Month day, year" (e.g., "October 26, 2024").

### Handling Time Zones

Handling time zones correctly is crucial for date-related applications. While `@mantine/dates` itself does not provide built-in time zone conversion, you can use libraries like `date-fns-tz` alongside it to handle time zone conversions.

```jsx
import { DatePicker } from '@mantine/dates';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { format, utcToZonedTime, zonedTimeToUtc } from 'date-fns-tz';

function MyComponent() {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(null);
  const timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles'; // Example timezone

  const handleDateChange = (newDate) => {
    // Convert to UTC before storing
    const utcDate = zonedTimeToUtc(newDate, timezone);
    setDate(utcDate);
  };

  const formattedDate = date ? format(utcToZonedTime(date, timezone), 'MMMM dd, yyyy HH:mm zzzz', { timeZone: timezone }) : 'No date selected';

  return (
    <>
      <DatePicker
        label="Select a date and time"
        value={date}
        onChange={handleDateChange}
        withTime // Enable time selection
      />
      <p>Selected date (Los Angeles): {formattedDate}</p>
    </>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Necessary Functions:** Import `utcToZonedTime`, `zonedTimeToUtc`, and `format` from `date-fns-tz`.
2.  **`zonedTimeToUtc`:** When a date is selected in the DatePicker, it represents the date and time in the user's local time.  You should immediately convert this to UTC before storing it.  The `zonedTimeToUtc` function takes the local time and the timezone and converts it to the equivalent UTC time.
3.  **Store UTC:**  Store the resulting UTC date in your state (`date`).
4.  **`utcToZonedTime`:** When displaying the date, convert it back to the desired timezone using `utcToZonedTime`.  This function takes the UTC time and the timezone and converts it to the equivalent time in that timezone.
5.  **`format` (with `timeZone`):** Use the `format` function from `date-fns-tz` and provide the `timeZone` option to ensure the correct timezone abbreviation is displayed.

**Important Considerations for Time Zones:**

*   **Storage:** Always store dates and times in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in your database or backend system.  This avoids ambiguity and simplifies time zone conversions.
*   **Time Zone Database:** Keep your time zone database up-to-date.  Time zones can change due to daylight saving time or political changes.  The `date-fns-tz` library uses the IANA time zone database.
*   **User's Time Zone:** Determine the user's time zone. You can use browser APIs or libraries to detect the user's time zone.  Alternatively, you can allow the user to select their time zone in the application settings.
*   **Daylight Saving Time (DST):**  Be aware of DST transitions when performing date and time calculations.  `date-fns-tz` handles DST transitions correctly.

### Integrating with Forms

`@mantine/dates` components can be easily integrated with form libraries like `react-hook-form` or `formik`. Here's an example using `react-hook-form`:

```jsx
import { DatePicker } from '@mantine/dates';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

function MyComponent() {
  const { register, handleSubmit, watch, formState: { errors } } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <DatePicker
        label="Select a date"
        {...register("date", { required: true })}
      />
      {errors.date && <p>This field is required</p>}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This example demonstrates how to register the `DatePicker` with `react-hook-form` using the `register` function.  The `required: true` option adds validation to the date picker, ensuring that a date is selected before the form can be submitted.
