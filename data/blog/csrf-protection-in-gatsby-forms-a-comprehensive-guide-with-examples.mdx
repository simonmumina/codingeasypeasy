# CSRF Protection in Gatsby Forms: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a user's browser into executing unwanted actions on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated. In simpler terms, an attacker can forge requests that appear to be coming from a legitimate user.

Gatsby, being a static site generator that often interacts with APIs or external services for form submissions, is also susceptible to CSRF attacks if proper precautions are not taken. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to implement CSRF protection in your Gatsby forms, ensuring the security of your web applications.

## Understanding CSRF

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand how CSRF attacks work:

1.  **User Authentication:** A user logs into a website (e.g., `example.com`) and is authenticated using cookies or other session mechanisms.
2.  **Malicious Website:** The attacker creates a malicious website (e.g., `attacker.com`) containing code that triggers a request to `example.com` on behalf of the logged-in user.
3.  **Forced Request:** When the user visits `attacker.com`, the malicious code executes, sending a request to `example.com` that can, for instance, change the user's email address or initiate a transaction. Because the browser automatically attaches the `example.com` cookies, the request appears to be legitimate.
4.  **Unintended Action:** `example.com` receives the request and, believing it to be from the authenticated user, executes the action.

## Implementing CSRF Protection in Gatsby

The most common and effective way to prevent CSRF attacks is by using synchronizer tokens, often called CSRF tokens. The general principle involves generating a unique, secret token on the server-side and including it in the form. When the form is submitted, the server verifies that the token is present and matches the expected value.

Here's a breakdown of how to implement CSRF protection in your Gatsby forms:

### 1. Server-Side Token Generation

Since Gatsby is a static site generator, you typically need a server-side function (e.g., a Netlify Function, AWS Lambda, or a dedicated backend) to generate and validate the CSRF token.

Here's an example of a Netlify Function (`functions/generate-csrf-token.js`) that generates a CSRF token:

```plaintext
// functions/generate-csrf-token.js
const crypto = require('crypto');

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  const csrfToken = crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex');
  // Store the CSRF token securely associated with the user's session or identifier.
  // This example uses a simple in-memory cache, which is NOT suitable for production.
  // In a real application, you'd use a database like Redis or a server-side session.
  global.csrfTokens = global.csrfTokens || {};  // In-memory storage (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
  const userId = 'unique_user_id'; // Replace with actual user ID retrieval from auth system

  global.csrfTokens[userId] = csrfToken;

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ csrfToken }),
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  };
};
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **User Identification:** Replace `"unique_user_id"` with a mechanism to properly identify the user (e.g., using their authenticated user ID from your authentication system).
- **Secure Storage:** **Crucially, the `global.csrfTokens` approach is only for demonstration purposes and MUST NOT be used in production.** Store the CSRF token securely associated with the user's session on the server-side (e.g., in a database, Redis, or server-side session). This is absolutely critical to the security of the implementation. If the token is easily accessible, it defeats the purpose of CSRF protection.
- **Token Expiration:** Set an expiration time for the CSRF token to further mitigate potential risks. A typical expiration time might be 15 minutes to an hour.
- **Domain Restriction:** If possible, restrict the scope of the generated CSRF token to the specific domain.

### 2. Client-Side Token Fetching

In your Gatsby component, fetch the CSRF token from the server-side function.

```plaintext
// src/components/MyForm.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyForm = () => {
  const [csrfToken, setCsrfToken] = useState('');
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    message: '',
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCsrfToken = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/generate-csrf-token');
        const data = await response.json();
        setCsrfToken(data.csrfToken);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching CSRF token:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchCsrfToken();
  }, []);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
  };

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/submit-form', { // Replace with your form submission API endpoint
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ ...formData, csrfToken }),
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        console.log('Form submitted successfully!');
      } else {
        console.error('Form submission failed:', response.status);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error submitting form:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="hidden" name="csrfToken" value={csrfToken} />

      <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" value={formData.name} onChange={handleChange} required />

      <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" value={formData.email} onChange={handleChange} required />

      <label htmlFor="message">Message:</label>
      <textarea id="message" name="message" value={formData.message} onChange={handleChange} required />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default MyForm;
```

**Explanation:**

- The `useEffect` hook fetches the CSRF token from the `/generate-csrf-token` Netlify Function when the component mounts.
- The token is stored in the component's state (`csrfToken`).
- A hidden input field (`<input type="hidden" name="csrfToken" value={csrfToken} />`) is added to the form, containing the CSRF token. This is crucial.
- The `handleSubmit` function includes the CSRF token in the request body when submitting the form data to the API endpoint.

### 3. Server-Side Token Validation

When the form is submitted, your backend API needs to validate the CSRF token.

Here's an example of a server-side function (`functions/submit-form.js`) that validates the CSRF token:

```plaintext
// functions/submit-form.js
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  if (event.httpMethod !== 'POST') {
    return { statusCode: 405, body: 'Method Not Allowed' };
  }

  try {
    const body = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const csrfToken = body.csrfToken;
    const name = body.name;
    const email = body.email;
    const message = body.message;

    const userId = 'unique_user_id'; // Replace with actual user ID retrieval from auth system

    // Retrieve the CSRF token associated with the user from secure storage.
    //  Again, global.csrfTokens is just for illustration. USE A DATABASE OR SERVER-SIDE SESSION!
    global.csrfTokens = global.csrfTokens || {};  // In-memory storage (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
    const expectedCsrfToken = global.csrfTokens[userId];

    if (!expectedCsrfToken || csrfToken !== expectedCsrfToken) {
      return { statusCode: 400, body: 'CSRF token validation failed.' };
    }

    // Remove the CSRF token from storage (optional, but recommended for single-use tokens)
    delete global.csrfTokens[userId];

    // Process the form data (e.g., save to a database, send an email)
    console.log('Form data:', { name, email, message });

    return { statusCode: 200, body: 'Form submitted successfully!' };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing form submission:', error);
    return { statusCode: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
  }
};
```

**Explanation:**

- The server-side function retrieves the CSRF token from the request body.
- It retrieves the expected CSRF token associated with the user from the secure storage (e.g., database, Redis, or server-side session).
- It compares the received CSRF token with the expected CSRF token. If they don't match, it returns a 400 status code indicating a CSRF validation failure.
- If the CSRF token is valid, the function proceeds to process the form data. Optionally the CSRF token can be deleted from storage to prevent reuse if a single-use token approach is desired.

### 4. Deploying to Netlify

Make sure to deploy your Gatsby site with the Netlify Functions to ensure the server-side logic is available. Configure your Gatsby `gatsby-config.js` to proxy API requests.

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  developMiddleware: app => {
    app.use(
      "/.netlify/functions/",
      proxy({
        target: "http://localhost:8888",  // or your Netlify Dev port
        pathRewrite: {
          "/.netlify/functions/": "",
        },
      })
    )
  }
};
```

### Additional Considerations and Best Practices

- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server. This is essential for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks that could steal the CSRF token.
- **Token Per Request (Single-Use Tokens):** For enhanced security, consider generating a new CSRF token for each form submission. After a token is used, it should be invalidated. The example above includes an optional step to delete the token after use. This prevents an attacker from reusing a compromised token.
- **Double Submit Cookie Technique:** This technique involves setting a cookie with the CSRF token and including the same token in the form data. While it's an alternative, it requires careful handling to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. It's generally recommended to use synchronizer tokens with secure server-side storage.
- **Referer Header Check (Not Reliable):** Checking the `Referer` header can be used as an additional security measure, but it's not a reliable defense against CSRF because the `Referer` header can be easily spoofed by attackers.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to prevent the injection of malicious scripts into your website. CSP helps mitigate XSS vulnerabilities, which can be used to bypass CSRF protection.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your website to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
