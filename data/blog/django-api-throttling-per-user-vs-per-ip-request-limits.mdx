# Django API Throttling: Per User vs. Per IP Request Limits

Protecting your API from abuse and ensuring fair usage is crucial for any web application. Django REST Framework (DRF) provides powerful built-in throttling mechanisms to limit the number of requests that can be made to your API, effectively preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensuring resource availability for all users. This blog post will delve into the two primary approaches for API throttling in Django: **per-user throttling** and **per-IP address throttling**, explaining their differences, use cases, and providing practical code examples.

## Why Throttle API Requests?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand why throttling is so important:

- **DoS Prevention:** Throttling prevents malicious actors from overwhelming your server with excessive requests, effectively mitigating DoS attacks.
- **Resource Management:** Limiting requests ensures fair usage of your server resources (CPU, memory, database connections) among all users.
- **Cost Optimization:** For cloud-based applications, excessive API usage can lead to significant cost overruns. Throttling helps control these costs.
- **Security:** Throttling can act as a deterrent against brute-force attacks and other malicious activities.
- **Service Stability:** By preventing overload, throttling helps maintain the stability and responsiveness of your API for legitimate users.

## Understanding Per-User vs. Per-IP Throttling

The fundamental difference between per-user and per-IP throttling lies in how the request limits are applied:

- **Per-User Throttling:** Limits the number of requests based on the _authenticated user_ making the request. This is ideal for scenarios where you want to provide different usage tiers or prevent individual users from monopolizing resources. It relies on user authentication being enabled and functioning correctly. Only authenticated users will be affected by per-user throttling.

- **Per-IP Throttling:** Limits the number of requests based on the _IP address_ from which the request originates. This is useful for preventing anonymous abuse or attacks originating from a single network. It's effective even for unauthenticated requests. However, it can potentially impact legitimate users sharing the same IP address (e.g., users behind a NAT gateway).

## Implementing Per-User Throttling in Django REST Framework

Let's see how to implement per-user throttling in DRF.

**1. Define a Custom Throttle Class:**

Create a new file, say `throttles.py`, in your Django app directory (or any suitable location). Define a custom throttle class that inherits from `rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle`. We'll set the `scope` attribute to define the rate limit.

```plaintext
# myapp/throttles.py

from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle

class CustomUserRateThrottle(UserRateThrottle):
    scope = 'user_throttle'  # Define the scope (name of the rate limit)
```

**2. Configure Settings:**

In your `settings.py` file, configure the `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings to include your custom throttle class and define the rate limits for the 'user_throttle' scope.

```plaintext
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'myapp.throttles.CustomUserRateThrottle' # Replace myapp with your app name
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'user_throttle': '60/min'  # Allow 60 requests per minute per user
    }
}
```

The `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` setting specifies the throttle classes to apply globally to all API views. `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` defines the rate limits for each scope. The rate '60/min' means 60 requests per minute. You can also use '100/hour', '1000/day', etc.

**3. Apply the Throttle to a View:**

You can apply the throttle globally as configured above, or selectively to specific views using the `throttle_classes` attribute.

```plaintext
# myapp/views.py

from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import permissions

class MyProtectedView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]  # Require authentication
    throttle_classes = [CustomUserRateThrottle]

    def get(self, request):
        # Your API logic here
        return Response({"message": "This is a protected view with user throttling."})
```

**Important Considerations for Per-User Throttling:**

- **Authentication is Essential:** Per-user throttling _requires_ that the user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, the throttle will typically not apply (or might fall back to another throttle mechanism if configured).
- **`permission_classes`:** Always use appropriate `permission_classes` to ensure that only authenticated users can access your API view. `permissions.IsAuthenticated` is commonly used for this purpose.
- **Authentication Backends:** Ensure that your Django authentication backends are correctly configured. DRF needs to be able to identify the user making the request.
- **Custom User Models:** If you are using a custom user model, ensure it's properly integrated with DRF.

## Implementing Per-IP Throttling in Django REST Framework

Per-IP throttling is useful when you want to limit access based on the IP address of the client, regardless of whether the user is authenticated.

**1. Define a Custom Throttle Class:**

Create a new throttle class that inherits from `rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle` or `rest_framework.throttling.ScopedRateThrottle`. `AnonRateThrottle` is for unauthenticated users, while `ScopedRateThrottle` allows for defining different rates for different views. If you want a single global IP based limit consider using `AnonRateThrottle`. For view specific configuration, use `ScopedRateThrottle`.

```plaintext
# myapp/throttles.py

from rest_framework.throttling import AnonRateThrottle, ScopedRateThrottle

class CustomAnonRateThrottle(AnonRateThrottle):
    scope = 'anon_throttle'  # Define the scope

class CustomScopedRateThrottle(ScopedRateThrottle):
    scope_attr = 'ip_throttle' # Must match the throttle name in view configuration
```

**2. Configure Settings (for `AnonRateThrottle`)**

In your `settings.py`, define the `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings to include the `AnonRateThrottle` and set the rate limits:

```plaintext
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'myapp.throttles.CustomAnonRateThrottle' # Replace myapp with your app name
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon_throttle': '100/min'  # Allow 100 requests per minute per IP
    }
}
```

**3. Configure View Specific Throttling (using `ScopedRateThrottle`)**

In your `settings.py`, you will NOT define the throttles globally. Instead, you'll use view-specific settings:

```plaintext
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {} # Remove global throttle configurations
```

Then, apply it in your view.

```plaintext
# myapp/views.py

from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import permissions
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, throttle_classes
from myapp.throttles import CustomScopedRateThrottle # Replace myapp

@api_view(['GET'])
@throttle_classes([CustomScopedRateThrottle])
def my_ip_protected_view(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return Response({"message": "This view is protected by IP throttling."})

my_ip_protected_view.ip_throttle = 'ip_throttle'  # Define the throttle scope for this view

```

**Important Considerations for Per-IP Throttling:**

- **IP Address Detection:** DRF relies on the `request.META` dictionary to determine the client's IP address. It typically checks the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` and `REMOTE_ADDR` headers. If you're behind a proxy or load balancer, you might need to configure Django's `MIDDLEWARE` to correctly handle the `X-Forwarded-For` header. See the Django documentation on proxy handling for details. Incorrect IP detection can lead to unintended throttling or bypass of the limits.
- **Shared IP Addresses:** Be aware that multiple users can share the same IP address, especially in NAT environments. IP-based throttling can inadvertently affect legitimate users in these cases. Consider the impact before implementing strict IP-based limits.
- **Dynamic IP Addresses:** Some users may have dynamic IP addresses that change frequently. This can make it difficult to track and throttle them effectively over long periods.
- **IPv6 Considerations:** Ensure your throttling implementation correctly handles IPv6 addresses.

## Combining Per-User and Per-IP Throttling

You can combine both per-user and per-IP throttling to create a more sophisticated rate-limiting strategy. For example, you might want to limit unauthenticated users to a lower rate than authenticated users.

**1. Configure Multiple Throttle Classes:**

In your view, specify multiple throttle classes in the `throttle_classes` attribute.

```plaintext
# myapp/views.py

from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import permissions
from myapp.throttles import CustomUserRateThrottle, CustomAnonRateThrottle # Replace myapp

class MyView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [permissions.AllowAny]  # Allow both authenticated and unauthenticated access
    throttle_classes = [CustomUserRateThrottle, CustomAnonRateThrottle]

    def get(self, request):
        # Your API logic here
        return Response({"message": "This view is protected by both user and IP throttling."})
```

With this configuration:

- Authenticated users will be subject to the `CustomUserRateThrottle` limit.
- Unauthenticated users will be subject to the `CustomAnonRateThrottle` limit.

## Advanced Throttling Techniques

- **Burst and Sustained Rate Limiting:** DRF's default throttling mechanism provides a sustained rate limit. For more advanced scenarios, you might consider implementing a burst rate limit, which allows a user to make a short burst of requests before being throttled. This can improve the user experience for interactive applications. Implement this via custom throttling logic, possibly with a caching mechanism.
- **Tiered Rate Limits:** You can implement tiered rate limits based on user roles or subscription levels. This can be achieved by creating custom throttle classes that check the user's role or subscription status and apply different rate limits accordingly.
- **Dynamic Rate Limits:** You can dynamically adjust rate limits based on server load or other factors. This requires more complex logic and typically involves monitoring your server's performance and adjusting the throttle rates in real-time.
- **Throttling Exemptions:** Sometimes, you might need to exempt certain users or IP addresses from throttling (e.g., for internal monitoring or testing). This can be achieved by creating a custom throttle class that checks for specific conditions and skips throttling accordingly.

## Best Practices for API Throttling

- **Start with Reasonable Limits:** Begin with moderate rate limits and adjust them based on your API's usage patterns and server capacity.
- **Provide Informative Error Messages:** When a user is throttled, return a clear and informative error message explaining the reason for the throttling and the time remaining until they can make another request. DRF provides a default `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` response.
- **Monitor Your Throttling System:** Regularly monitor your throttling system to identify potential issues or areas for improvement. Track the number of throttled requests and the impact on your API's performance.
- **Document Your Throttling Policies:** Clearly document your API's throttling policies in your API documentation so that developers understand the limits and how to avoid being throttled.
- **Consider Using a Dedicated Rate Limiting Service:** For complex throttling requirements or high-traffic APIs, consider using a dedicated rate limiting service like Redis or a cloud-based API gateway. These services can provide more advanced features and better performance.
- **Test Your Throttling Implementation:** Thoroughly test your throttling implementation to ensure that it is working as expected and does not have any unintended consequences.

## Conclusion

API throttling is a critical aspect of building secure and scalable web applications. By understanding the differences between per-user and per-IP throttling and implementing them effectively in your Django REST Framework APIs, you can protect your resources, ensure fair usage, and improve the overall stability and performance of your application. Remember to carefully consider your specific requirements and choose the throttling strategy that best suits your needs.
