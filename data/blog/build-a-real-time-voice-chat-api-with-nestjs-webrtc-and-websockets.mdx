# Build a Real-Time Voice Chat API with NestJS, WebRTC, and WebSockets

This article provides a step-by-step guide on building a real-time voice chat API using NestJS, WebRTC, and WebSockets. We'll explore the fundamental concepts behind these technologies and demonstrate how to integrate them to create a functional voice chat application.

## Understanding the Technologies

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly understand the core technologies involved:

- **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and provides a modular architecture for organizing code. We'll use NestJS to build our backend API.

- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):** A free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. WebRTC enables peer-to-peer audio and video streaming directly between browsers, minimizing server load and latency.

- **WebSockets:** A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This allows for real-time data exchange between the server and the client, essential for signaling and managing WebRTC connections.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Version 16 or higher is recommended.
- **npm or Yarn:** Package managers for installing dependencies.
- **NestJS CLI:** Install globally using `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`.

## Setting Up the NestJS Project

1.  **Create a new NestJS project:**

    ```plaintext
    nest new voice-chat-api
    cd voice-chat-api
    ```

2.  **Install necessary dependencies:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install @nestjs/platform-ws ws reflect-metadata rxjs class-validator class-transformer
    ```

    - `@nestjs/platform-ws`: Provides WebSocket support for NestJS.
    - `ws`: A popular WebSocket implementation for Node.js.
    - `reflect-metadata`, `rxjs`, `class-validator`, `class-transformer`: Dependencies used by NestJS and its modules.

## Creating the WebSocket Gateway

A WebSocket gateway acts as the entry point for WebSocket connections. We'll create a gateway to handle signaling messages between peers.

1.  **Generate a new gateway:**

    ```plaintext
    nest g gateway chat
    ```

2.  **Update `src/chat/chat.gateway.ts`:**

    ```plaintext
    import {
      WebSocketGateway,
      SubscribeMessage,
      MessageBody,
      WebSocketServer,
      OnGatewayInit,
      OnGatewayConnection,
      OnGatewayDisconnect,
    } from '@nestjs/platform-ws'
    import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common'
    import { Server, Socket } from 'socket.io'

    @WebSocketGateway({
      cors: {
        origin: '*', // Adjust this for production!
      },
    })
    export class ChatGateway implements OnGatewayInit, OnGatewayConnection, OnGatewayDisconnect {
      @WebSocketServer()
      server: Server

      private logger: Logger = new Logger('ChatGateway')

      afterInit(server: Server) {
        this.logger.log('Initialized!')
      }

      handleConnection(client: Socket, ...args: any[]) {
        this.logger.log(`Client connected: ${client.id}`)
      }

      handleDisconnect(client: Socket) {
        this.logger.log(`Client disconnected: ${client.id}`)
      }

      @SubscribeMessage('joinRoom')
      handleJoinRoom(
        @MessageBody() data: { roomId: string; userId: string },
        client: Socket
      ): void {
        client.join(data.roomId)
        this.server.to(data.roomId).emit('userJoined', data.userId)
        this.logger.log(`User ${data.userId} joined room ${data.roomId}`)
      }

      @SubscribeMessage('leaveRoom')
      handleLeaveRoom(
        @MessageBody() data: { roomId: string; userId: string },
        client: Socket
      ): void {
        client.leave(data.roomId)
        this.server.to(data.roomId).emit('userLeft', data.userId)
        this.logger.log(`User ${data.userId} left room ${data.roomId}`)
      }

      @SubscribeMessage('offer')
      handleOffer(
        @MessageBody() data: { sdp: string; receiverId: string; roomId: string },
        client: Socket
      ): void {
        this.server
          .to(data.roomId)
          .emit('offer', { sdp: data.sdp, senderId: client.id, receiverId: data.receiverId })
        this.logger.log(`Offer sent from ${client.id} to ${data.receiverId}`)
      }

      @SubscribeMessage('answer')
      handleAnswer(
        @MessageBody() data: { sdp: string; receiverId: string; roomId: string },
        client: Socket
      ): void {
        this.server
          .to(data.roomId)
          .emit('answer', { sdp: data.sdp, senderId: client.id, receiverId: data.receiverId })
        this.logger.log(`Answer sent from ${client.id} to ${data.receiverId}`)
      }

      @SubscribeMessage('iceCandidate')
      handleIceCandidate(
        @MessageBody() data: { candidate: RTCIceCandidate; receiverId: string; roomId: string },
        client: Socket
      ): void {
        this.server
          .to(data.roomId)
          .emit('iceCandidate', {
            candidate: data.candidate,
            senderId: client.id,
            receiverId: data.receiverId,
          })
        this.logger.log(`ICE candidate sent from ${client.id} to ${data.receiverId}`)
      }
    }
    ```

    - `@WebSocketGateway()`: Decorator that marks the class as a WebSocket gateway. The `cors` option allows connections from specified origins (adjust this for production to prevent security issues).
    - `@WebSocketServer()`: Injects the WebSocket server instance.
    - `OnGatewayInit`, `OnGatewayConnection`, `OnGatewayDisconnect`: Lifecycle hooks for handling gateway initialization, connection, and disconnection events.
    - `@SubscribeMessage()`: Decorator that registers a message handler for a specific event.
    - `joinRoom`, `leaveRoom`, `offer`, `answer`, `iceCandidate`: Message handlers for managing room membership and WebRTC signaling.
    - `Server`: Represents the WebSocket server instance.
    - `Socket`: Represents an individual client connection.
    - `Logger`: NestJS's built-in logging service.

3.  **Import the gateway module in `app.module.ts`**

    ```plaintext
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
    import { AppController } from './app.controller'
    import { AppService } from './app.service'
    import { ChatGateway } from './chat/chat.gateway'

    @Module({
      imports: [],
      controllers: [AppController],
      providers: [AppService, ChatGateway],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

## Explanation of Signaling Messages

The gateway handles the following signaling messages essential for WebRTC:

- **`joinRoom`:** A client sends this message when they want to join a specific voice chat room. The server adds the client to the room using `client.join(roomId)` and emits a `userJoined` event to all other clients in the room.

- **`leaveRoom`:** A client sends this message when they want to leave a voice chat room. The server removes the client from the room using `client.leave(roomId)` and emits a `userLeft` event to all other clients in the room.

- **`offer`:** The initiating peer (the one starting the call) creates an SDP (Session Description Protocol) offer describing their media capabilities. This message contains the `sdp` (the offer itself), the `receiverId` (the ID of the peer to whom the offer is intended), and the `roomId`. The server forwards this offer to the intended receiver.

- **`answer`:** The receiving peer, upon receiving the offer, creates an SDP answer describing their media capabilities and compatibility with the offer. This message contains the `sdp` (the answer itself), the `receiverId` (the ID of the peer who sent the offer), and the `roomId`. The server forwards this answer back to the initiating peer.

- **`iceCandidate`:** During the WebRTC connection process, each peer gathers ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates, which are potential network addresses and transport protocols that can be used to establish a connection. This message contains the `candidate` (the ICE candidate itself), the `receiverId` (the ID of the peer to whom the candidate is intended), and the `roomId`. The server forwards these candidates to the other peer, allowing them to attempt to establish a connection.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the NestJS application:**

    ```plaintext
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and watch for file changes.

## Client-Side Implementation (Conceptual Example)

While a full client-side implementation is beyond the scope of this article, here's a conceptual outline using JavaScript:

```plaintext
// Client-side JavaScript (Conceptual)

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000') // Replace with your server address

const roomId = 'my-voice-chat-room'
const userId = 'user123' // Unique user ID

let peerConnection

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket server')
  socket.emit('joinRoom', { roomId, userId: socket.id }) //Using the socket id as the user id, but better is to use a dedicated unique identifier.
})

socket.on('userJoined', (userId) => {
  console.log(`User ${userId} joined the room`)
  createOffer(userId) // Create an offer when a new user joins
})

socket.on('userLeft', (userId) => {
  console.log(`User ${userId} left the room`)
  // Handle user leaving (e.g., close peer connection)
  if (peerConnection) {
    peerConnection.close()
    peerConnection = null
  }
})

socket.on('offer', async (data) => {
  console.log('Received offer:', data)
  await createAnswer(data.sdp, data.senderId)
})

socket.on('answer', async (data) => {
  console.log('Received answer:', data)
  await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(data.sdp))
})

socket.on('iceCandidate', async (data) => {
  console.log('Received ICE candidate:', data)
  try {
    await peerConnection.addIceCandidate(data.candidate)
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Error adding ice candidate:', e)
  }
})

async function createOffer(remoteUserId) {
  peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection()

  // Add local stream (audio) to the peer connection
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: false })
  stream.getTracks().forEach((track) => peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream))

  peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
    if (event.candidate) {
      socket.emit('iceCandidate', { candidate: event.candidate, receiverId: remoteUserId, roomId })
    }
  }

  peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
    // Handle incoming stream (e.g., play audio)
    const audio = new Audio()
    audio.srcObject = event.streams[0]
    audio.play()
  }

  const offer = await peerConnection.createOffer()
  await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer)

  socket.emit('offer', { sdp: offer.sdp, receiverId: remoteUserId, roomId })
}

async function createAnswer(offerSdp, remoteUserId) {
  peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection()

  // Add local stream (audio) to the peer connection
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: false })
  stream.getTracks().forEach((track) => peerConnection.addTrack(track, stream))

  peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
    if (event.candidate) {
      socket.emit('iceCandidate', { candidate: event.candidate, receiverId: remoteUserId, roomId })
    }
  }

  peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
    // Handle incoming stream (e.g., play audio)
    const audio = new Audio()
    audio.srcObject = event.streams[0]
    audio.play()
  }

  await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offerSdp))
  const answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer()
  await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer)

  socket.emit('answer', { sdp: answer.sdp, receiverId: remoteUserId, roomId })
}
```

This client-side code illustrates the key steps involved in WebRTC signaling:

1.  **Connecting to the WebSocket server.**
2.  **Joining a room.**
3.  **Creating and sending an offer.**
4.  **Creating and sending an answer.**
5.  **Exchanging ICE candidates.**
6.  **Handling incoming audio streams.**

**Important Considerations:**

- **STUN/TURN Servers:** WebRTC often requires STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers to establish connections between peers behind NAT firewalls. Configure your `RTCPeerConnection` with STUN/TURN server information. You can use free STUN servers (like Google's `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`) for testing, but for production, consider using a commercial STUN/TURN service.

  ```plaintext
  const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
    iceServers: [
      { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
      // Add TURN servers for production!
      // { urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com', username: 'your-username', credential: 'your-password' }
    ],
  })
  ```

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout your code to gracefully manage potential issues during the connection process.

- **Security:** In production, always use secure WebSockets (WSS) and carefully validate data received from clients to prevent security vulnerabilities. The CORS configuration on the server should be restricted to trusted origins.

- **UI/UX:** Design a user-friendly interface for managing voice chat rooms, muting/unmuting users, and handling connection states.
