# Gatsby Image: Gatsby-image vs. Gatsby-plugin-image - A Comprehensive Comparison

Images are crucial for a visually appealing and engaging website. However, large, unoptimized images can significantly impact your website's performance, leading to slow loading times and a poor user experience. Gatsby, a popular React-based static site generator, offers powerful solutions for image optimization. This blog post delves into the key differences between `gatsby-image` and `gatsby-plugin-image`, the two primary options for handling images in Gatsby, helping you choose the best fit for your project.

## What is Gatsby-image?

`gatsby-image` was the original official image plugin for Gatsby. It provided a convenient and performant way to display images on your Gatsby site by:

- **Generating multiple image sizes:** It automatically created various image sizes to serve the most appropriate size based on the user's device and screen size.
- **Lazy loading:** Images were loaded only when they came into the viewport, improving initial page load time.
- **Blur-up effect:** It displayed a low-resolution, blurred version of the image while the full-resolution image loaded, providing a smoother visual experience.
- **WebP support:** It could generate WebP images (a modern image format offering superior compression) when supported by the browser.

While `gatsby-image` served its purpose well, it had some limitations that `gatsby-plugin-image` addresses.

## What is Gatsby-plugin-image?

`gatsby-plugin-image` is the successor to `gatsby-image` and is now the recommended image plugin for Gatsby. It's designed to be more performant, flexible, and easier to use. Key improvements include:

- **Improved Performance:** `gatsby-plugin-image` uses a more efficient image processing pipeline and offers better support for modern image formats like AVIF.
- **Simplified API:** The API is designed to be more intuitive and flexible, making it easier to control image optimization and rendering.
- **Static and Dynamic Image Handling:** Supports both statically imported images (ideal for fixed assets) and dynamically sourced images (from CMS or data sources).
- **Modern Image Formats (AVIF):** Provides automatic generation of AVIF images (the next-generation image format) for browsers that support it. This offers even better compression than WebP, leading to smaller file sizes and faster loading times.
- **Optimized Build Times:** Uses intelligent caching and incremental builds to significantly reduce build times, especially for projects with a large number of images.
- **More Control over Placeholder:** Offers more control over the placeholder image used while the full image loads (e.g., SVG traces, blurred images, solid colors).

## Key Differences: Gatsby-image vs. Gatsby-plugin-image

Here's a breakdown of the core differences between the two plugins:

| Feature            | `gatsby-image`                                 | `gatsby-plugin-image`                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Plugin**    | Separate plugin for fixed and fluid images.    | Single plugin handles both fixed and fluid images.                    |
| **Image Format**   | Primarily JPEG and PNG with WebP support.      | JPEG, PNG, WebP, and AVIF support.                                    |
| **API**            | Requires complex GraphQL queries.              | Simpler API with `GatsbyImage` component and hooks.                   |
| **Performance**    | Good performance, but can be improved.         | Significantly improved performance and optimization.                  |
| **Build Times**    | Can be slow for large image sets.              | Faster build times due to better caching.                             |
| **Placeholders**   | Limited options for placeholder customization. | More flexible placeholder options (blurred, traced SVG, solid color). |
| **Maintenance**    | No longer actively maintained.                 | Actively maintained and supported.                                    |
| **Recommendation** | Legacy, avoid for new projects.                | Recommended for all new Gatsby projects.                              |

## Code Examples: Demonstrating the Differences

Let's illustrate the differences with code examples.

### Gatsby-image Example (Legacy)

This example uses `gatsby-image` with GraphQL to fetch and display an image.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
import Img from 'gatsby-image'

const ImageComponent = () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      file(relativePath: { eq: "your-image.jpg" }) {
        childImageSharp {
          fluid {
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  return <Img fluid={data.file.childImageSharp.fluid} alt="Your Image" />
}

export default ImageComponent
```

This approach requires a complex GraphQL query and using the `Img` component from `gatsby-image`.

### Gatsby-plugin-image Example (Recommended)

This example uses `gatsby-plugin-image` with the `GatsbyImage` component and GraphQL.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
import { GatsbyImage, getImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image'

const ImageComponent = () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      file(relativePath: { eq: "your-image.jpg" }) {
        childImageSharp {
          gatsbyImageData(width: 800, placeholder: BLURRED, formats: [AUTO, WEBP, AVIF])
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  const image = getImage(data.file.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData)

  return <GatsbyImage image={image} alt="Your Image" />
}

export default ImageComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- **`gatsbyImageData`:** This GraphQL field simplifies the query and handles image processing options directly in the query.
- **`width`:** Specifies the desired width of the image.
- **`placeholder`:** Defines the type of placeholder to use (e.g., `BLURRED`, `TRACED_SVG`). Other options include `DOMINANT_COLOR`, and `NONE`.
- **`formats`:** Specifies the image formats to generate (e.g., `AUTO`, `WEBP`, `AVIF`). `AUTO` intelligently chooses the best formats based on the browser.
- **`getImage`:** This function transforms the GraphQL data into the format expected by the `GatsbyImage` component.
- **`GatsbyImage`:** This component displays the optimized image.

**Alternatively, you can use Static Image:**

For static images, you can directly import and use the `StaticImage` component:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StaticImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image'

const StaticImageComponent = () => {
  return (
    <StaticImage
      src="../images/your-image.jpg"
      alt="Your Image"
      placeholder="blurred"
      layout="constrained"
      width={800}
    />
  )
}

export default StaticImageComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- **`StaticImage`:** A component that handles image optimization for statically imported images.
- **`src`:** The relative path to the image file.
- **`layout`:** Defines how the image scales (`fixed`, `fullWidth`, `constrained`).
- **`width`:** The desired width of the image.

## Migrating from Gatsby-image to Gatsby-plugin-image

If you have an existing Gatsby project using `gatsby-image`, migrating to `gatsby-plugin-image` is highly recommended. Here's a general outline of the process:

1.  **Uninstall `gatsby-image`:**

    ```plaintext
    npm uninstall gatsby-image
    ```

2.  **Install `gatsby-plugin-image` and dependencies:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install gatsby-plugin-image gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-sharp
    ```

    Make sure you already have `gatsby-plugin-sharp`, `gatsby-source-filesystem`, and `gatsby-transformer-sharp`. If not install them.

3.  **Configure `gatsby-config.js`:**

    ```plaintext
    module.exports = {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-plugin-image`,
        `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
        `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
          options: {
            name: `images`,
            path: `${__dirname}/src/images`,
          },
        },
      ],
    }
    ```

4.  **Update GraphQL Queries:** Modify your GraphQL queries to use the `gatsbyImageData` field and specify the desired image options.

5.  **Replace `Img` with `GatsbyImage`:** Replace the `Img` component from `gatsby-image` with the `GatsbyImage` component from `gatsby-plugin-image`. Use the `getImage` helper function.

6.  **Refactor Static Images:** Use the `StaticImage` component for any statically imported images.

7.  **Test Thoroughly:** After making these changes, thoroughly test your website to ensure that images are loading correctly and optimized.

## When to use which?

- **Use `gatsby-plugin-image` for all new Gatsby projects.** It's the modern, recommended solution offering superior performance, flexibility, and future-proof support.
- **Migrate existing `gatsby-image` projects to `gatsby-plugin-image` for significant performance improvements.** While it requires some code refactoring, the benefits are well worth the effort.

## Conclusion

`gatsby-plugin-image` represents a significant improvement over `gatsby-image`. Its superior performance, simpler API, and support for modern image formats make it the clear choice for handling images in Gatsby projects. By adopting `gatsby-plugin-image`, you can optimize your images, improve your website's performance, and deliver a better user experience. So, embrace the power of `gatsby-plugin-image` and take your Gatsby image optimization to the next level!
