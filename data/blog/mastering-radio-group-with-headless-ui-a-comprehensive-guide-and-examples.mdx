# Mastering Radio Group with Headless UI: A Comprehensive Guide & Examples

Headless UI is a fantastic library for building accessible and fully customizable UI components without any pre-defined styling. It provides the structural logic and accessibility features, leaving the visual presentation entirely up to you. This allows for seamless integration with your existing styling system, be it Tailwind CSS, styled-components, or plain CSS. In this guide, we'll delve into the power of Headless UI's `RadioGroup` component, covering its fundamental usage, advanced customization, accessibility features, and integration with form validation.

## What is Headless UI RadioGroup?

The `RadioGroup` component in Headless UI provides the necessary logic and accessibility attributes to create a fully functional radio button group.  Think of it as the "brains" of your radio buttons, handling state management, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes. You provide the "beauty" by applying your own styling and structure. This separation of concerns allows for maximum flexibility and control.

## Setting Up Your Project

Before we dive into the code, let's make sure you have the necessary tools installed. You'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) to manage your project dependencies.

1. **Create a new React project (if you don't have one already):**

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-headlessui-radiogroup
   cd my-headlessui-radiogroup
   ```

2. **Install Headless UI:**

   ```bash
   npm install @headlessui/react
   ```

3. **(Optional) Install Tailwind CSS (highly recommended):**

   Follow the official Tailwind CSS installation guide for your React project. This typically involves installing `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`, and configuring your `tailwind.config.js` file.  See the Tailwind CSS documentation for detailed instructions specific to your setup: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

## Basic RadioGroup Implementation

Let's start with a basic example of a `RadioGroup` component using Headless UI:

```jsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@headlessui/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function BasicRadioGroup() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState('React')

  const frameworks = [
    { id: 'react', name: 'React' },
    { id: 'vue', name: 'Vue' },
    { id: 'angular', name: 'Angular' },
  ]

  return (
    <RadioGroup value={selected} onChange={setSelected}>
      <RadioGroup.Label>Select your favorite JavaScript framework:</RadioGroup.Label>
      <div className="space-y-2">
        {frameworks.map((framework) => (
          <RadioGroup.Option
            key={framework.id}
            value={framework.name}
            className={({ active, checked }) =>
              `${active ? 'bg-blue-100' : ''}
              ${checked ? 'bg-blue-200' : ''}
                focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500
                rounded-lg p-2 cursor-pointer`
            }
          >
            {({ checked }) => (
              <>
                <div>{framework.name}</div>
                {checked && <span> (Selected)</span>}
              </>
            )}
          </RadioGroup.Option>
        ))}
      </div>
    </RadioGroup>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`RadioGroup`:** The main component responsible for managing the state and accessibility of the radio group.
* **`value`:**  The currently selected value.  It's bound to the `selected` state variable using `useState`.
* **`onChange`:**  A function that is called when a different radio button is selected.  It updates the `selected` state variable.
* **`RadioGroup.Label`:** Provides a label for the radio group, improving accessibility for screen readers. It automatically associates with the `RadioGroup`.
* **`RadioGroup.Option`:** Represents a single radio button.
* **`key`:**  Essential for React's rendering performance when mapping over arrays.
* **`value`:**  The value associated with this particular radio button.  It must match the type of the `value` prop on the `RadioGroup` component.
* **`className`:** This is where you apply your styling.  In this example, we're using Tailwind CSS classes. The `({ active, checked }) => ...` function provides access to the `active` and `checked` states of the option, allowing for dynamic styling.
* **`active`:**  Indicates if the option is currently focused or hovered.
* **`checked`:**  Indicates if the option is currently selected.

**Important Accessibility Considerations:**

Headless UI takes care of a lot of the accessibility for you.  Specifically, it:

* **Adds ARIA attributes:**  Sets appropriate `aria-` attributes (like `aria-checked`, `aria-labelledby`, and `role`) to make the radio group accessible to assistive technologies.
* **Manages keyboard navigation:** Allows users to navigate between radio buttons using the arrow keys.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

The beauty of Headless UI lies in its unstyled nature.  Tailwind CSS is a popular choice for styling Headless UI components because of its utility-first approach and ease of customization.  Let's break down the Tailwind CSS classes used in the example above:

* **`bg-blue-100`:** Background color (light blue)
* **`bg-blue-200`:** Background color (slightly darker blue)
* **`focus:outline-none`:** Removes the default browser outline on focus.
* **`focus:ring-2`:** Adds a ring (border) on focus.
* **`focus:ring-blue-500`:** Sets the ring color to blue.
* **`rounded-lg`:** Rounds the corners of the element.
* **`p-2`:** Adds padding.
* **`cursor-pointer`:** Changes the cursor to a pointer on hover.
* **`space-y-2`:** Adds vertical spacing between the radio button options using the space-between utility.

You can customize these classes to match your design system. Tailwind CSS offers a wide range of utilities for controlling typography, spacing, colors, shadows, and more.

## Advanced Customization

Headless UI provides several opportunities for advanced customization:

### 1. Using Fragments and Render Props

The `RadioGroup.Option` component uses a render prop pattern, meaning you can access the `checked` and `active` states and render any content you want within the option.  This allows for highly customized layouts.

```jsx
 <RadioGroup.Option
  key={framework.id}
  value={framework.name}
  className={({ active, checked }) => /* ... styling ... */}
>
  {({ checked }) => (
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <input type="radio" className="hidden" checked={checked} readOnly />
      <span className={`w-5 h-5 rounded-full mr-2 border ${checked ? 'bg-blue-500 border-blue-500' : 'border-gray-300'}`}></span>
      <span>{framework.name}</span>
    </div>
  )}
</RadioGroup.Option>
```

In this example, we create a custom radio button indicator using a `span` element and dynamically style it based on the `checked` state.  The hidden `<input type="radio">` is included for semantic correctness, but hidden from the user. The `readOnly` attribute prevents direct user interaction with the original radio input, ensuring that Headless UI's state management handles the selection logic.

### 2. Custom Styling with State

You can apply different styles based on the `active`, `checked`, `disabled`, and `focus` states of the radio button options.  This allows you to create interactive and visually appealing components.  Use Tailwind CSS's state modifiers (e.g., `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`) or conditional class names based on the state variables.

### 3. Integrating with Form Validation Libraries

Headless UI can be easily integrated with popular form validation libraries like Formik, React Hook Form, or Yup. This allows you to validate the selected radio button value and provide feedback to the user.

Here's an example using React Hook Form:

```jsx
import { RadioGroup } from '@headlessui/react';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

export default function RadioGroupWithValidation() {
  const { register, handleSubmit, watch, formState: { errors } } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  };

  const frameworks = [
    { id: 'react', name: 'React' },
    { id: 'vue', name: 'Vue' },
    { id: 'angular', name: 'Angular' },
  ];

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <RadioGroup {...register("framework", { required: "Please select a framework." })} >
        <RadioGroup.Label>Select your favorite JavaScript framework:</RadioGroup.Label>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          {frameworks.map((framework) => (
            <RadioGroup.Option
              key={framework.id}
              value={framework.name}
              className={({ active, checked }) =>
                `${active ? 'bg-blue-100' : ''}
                ${checked ? 'bg-blue-200' : ''}
                  focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500
                  rounded-lg p-2 cursor-pointer`
              }
            >
              {({ checked }) => (
                <div>
                  {framework.name}
                  {checked && <span> (Selected)</span>}
                </div>
              )}
            </RadioGroup.Option>
          ))}
        </div>
      </RadioGroup>
      {errors.framework && <p className="text-red-500">{errors.framework.message}</p>}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`useForm`:**  A hook from React Hook Form that provides functions for managing form state, validation, and submission.
* **`register("framework", { required: "Please select a framework." })`:**  Registers the `RadioGroup` component with React Hook Form and sets the `required` validation rule.  The `RadioGroup` will behave as a controlled component updating with the form state managed by `useForm`.  The `required` property defines the validation rule and the corresponding error message.
* **`errors.framework && <p className="text-red-500">{errors.framework.message}</p>`:** Displays an error message if the `framework` field is invalid (i.e., no radio button is selected).

### 4. Handling Disabled States

You can disable individual radio button options or the entire radio group using the `disabled` prop on the `RadioGroup.Option` component or the `disabled` attribute on an HTML element within its render prop. This will prevent users from selecting the disabled option.

```jsx
 <RadioGroup.Option
    key={frameworks[0].id}
    value={frameworks[0].name}
    disabled={true} // Disable the first option
    className={({ active, checked, disabled }) =>
      `${active ? 'bg-blue-100' : ''}
      ${checked ? 'bg-blue-200' : ''}
      ${disabled ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed' : ''}
        focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500
        rounded-lg p-2 cursor-pointer`
    }
  >
    {({ checked }) => (
      <div>
        {frameworks[0].name} (Disabled)
        {checked && <span> (Selected)</span>}
      </div>
    )}
  </RadioGroup.Option>
```

In this example, the first radio button is disabled.  We also add styling to visually indicate that the option is disabled (using `opacity-50` and `cursor-not-allowed`).  Headless UI automatically handles the accessibility aspects of the disabled state (e.g., preventing keyboard focus).

## Best Practices

* **Provide clear and concise labels:**  Make sure the labels for your radio buttons accurately describe the options.
* **Use proper semantic HTML:**  Use `<RadioGroup.Label>` for the radio group label.
* **Test with screen readers:**  Verify that your radio group is accessible to users with assistive technologies.
* **Consider mobile responsiveness:** Ensure that your radio buttons are easily selectable on touch devices.
