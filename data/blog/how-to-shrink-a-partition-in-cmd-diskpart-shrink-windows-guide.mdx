# How to Shrink a Partition in CMD (Diskpart Shrink): Windows Guide

Running out of space on your Windows drive? Need to create a new partition? Shrinking an existing partition using the command line tool Diskpart is a powerful and efficient way to manage your disk space. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of how to safely shrink a partition using the `shrink` command within Diskpart.

## Why Shrink a Partition Using CMD (Diskpart)?

While Windows offers a graphical Disk Management tool, using Diskpart via the Command Prompt (CMD) can be advantageous for several reasons:

- **Automation:** You can script the process, making it ideal for automating disk management tasks or including it in larger system administration scripts.
- **Remote Management:** It's perfect for managing servers or remote computers where a GUI may not be readily available or desired.
- **Precision:** Diskpart gives you precise control over the amount of space you want to shrink.
- **GUI-less Environments:** Essential in environments lacking a graphical user interface, such as recovery environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Administrator Privileges:** You need administrator privileges to run Diskpart.
- **Backup (Highly Recommended):** Always back up your important data before making any changes to your disk partitions. While shrinking a partition is generally safe, unforeseen issues can occur.
- **Understanding of Disk and Partition Concepts:** A basic understanding of disks, partitions, volumes, and file systems is helpful.
- **Sufficient Free Space:** Ensure the partition you intend to shrink has enough free space to accommodate the desired reduction.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Shrinking a Partition with Diskpart

Here's the detailed process for shrinking a partition using Diskpart in Windows:

### 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator

- Press the Windows key, type `cmd`, and right-click on "Command Prompt."
- Select "Run as administrator."
- If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click "Yes."

### 2. Launch Diskpart

In the Command Prompt window, type `diskpart` and press Enter. This will launch the Diskpart utility.

```plaintext
diskpart
```

### 3. List Available Disks

To identify the disk containing the partition you want to shrink, use the `list disk` command.

```plaintext
list disk
```

Diskpart will display a list of all disks connected to your system, along with their size and status. Note the disk number that contains the target partition. For example:

```
  Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
  --------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---
  Disk 0    Online          476 GB      0 B        *
  Disk 1    Online          931 GB      0 B        *
```

### 4. Select the Target Disk

Use the `select disk` command to choose the disk containing the partition you want to shrink. Replace `<disk_number>` with the actual disk number identified in the previous step.

```plaintext
select disk <disk_number>
```

For example, to select disk 0, you would type:

```plaintext
select disk 0
```

Diskpart will confirm the selection:

```
Disk 0 is now the selected disk.
```

### 5. List Partitions on the Selected Disk

Next, list the partitions on the selected disk to identify the specific partition you want to shrink. Use the `list partition` command.

```plaintext
list partition
```

Diskpart will display a list of partitions on the selected disk, along with their size and type. Note the partition number you want to shrink. For example:

```
  Partition ###  Type              Size     Offset
  -------------  ----------------  -------  -------
  Partition 1    System             100 MB  1024 KB
  Partition 2    Reserved           16 MB  101 MB
  Partition 3    Primary           475 GB  117 MB
```

### 6. Select the Target Partition

Use the `select partition` command to choose the partition you want to shrink. Replace `<partition_number>` with the actual partition number identified in the previous step.

```plaintext
select partition <partition_number>
```

For example, to select partition 3, you would type:

```plaintext
select partition 3
```

Diskpart will confirm the selection:

```
Partition 3 is now the selected partition.
```

### 7. Shrink the Partition

Now, use the `shrink` command to reduce the size of the selected partition. The `shrink` command has several options:

- `desired=<size>`: Specifies the amount of space, in megabytes (MB), that you want to shrink the partition.
- `minimum=<size>`: Specifies the minimum amount of space, in megabytes (MB), that you want to shrink the partition. Diskpart will shrink the partition by this amount or more if possible.
- `querymax`: Displays the maximum number of reclaimable bytes, in megabytes (MB). This can be helpful in determining the maximum amount you can shrink the partition.

**a. Determine the Maximum Shrink Size (Optional but Recommended)**

Before specifying the shrink amount, it's good practice to determine the maximum available shrink size. Use the `shrink querymax` command.

```plaintext
shrink querymax
```

Diskpart will display the maximum amount of space (in MB) you can shrink the partition. For example:

```
Maximum bytes available: 123456 MB
```

**b. Shrink the Partition (Using `desired`)**

To shrink the partition by a specific amount, use the `shrink desired=<size>` command. Replace `<size>` with the desired amount in megabytes (MB).

```plaintext
shrink desired=<size>
```

For example, to shrink the partition by 20480 MB (20 GB), you would type:

```plaintext
shrink desired=20480
```

**c. Shrink the Partition (Using `minimum`)**

To shrink the partition by at least a certain amount, use the `shrink minimum=<size>` command. Replace `<size>` with the minimum amount in megabytes (MB).

```plaintext
shrink minimum=<size>
```

For example, to shrink the partition by at least 10240 MB (10 GB), you would type:

```plaintext
shrink minimum=10240
```

**Important Considerations When Choosing the Shrink Size:**

- **Never shrink a partition to less than its used space.** Doing so will likely corrupt your data.
- **The maximum shrink size is limited by the amount of contiguous free space at the end of the partition and by the location of unmovable files.** If you can't shrink the partition as much as you want, try defragmenting the drive first.
- **System partitions may have limited shrinkability due to the location of system files.**

### 8. Verify the Shrink Operation

After shrinking the partition, verify the changes by listing the partitions again.

```plaintext
list partition
```

You should see that the selected partition is now smaller, and there is unallocated space on the disk.

### 9. Exit Diskpart

To exit Diskpart, type `exit` and press Enter.

```plaintext
exit
```

### 10. Exit Command Prompt

To close the Command Prompt window, type `exit` and press Enter.

```plaintext
exit
```

## What to Do After Shrinking the Partition

After shrinking the partition, you'll have unallocated space on your disk. You can use this unallocated space to:

- **Create a new partition:** This is useful if you want to install another operating system or separate data.
- **Extend an existing partition:** You can extend an adjacent partition to include the unallocated space, giving it more storage capacity. Note that the unallocated space _must_ be immediately adjacent to the partition you wish to extend.

You can perform both of these actions using Diskpart or the graphical Disk Management tool.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not enough space available on disk(s) to complete this operation."** This error usually indicates that the partition doesn't have enough contiguous free space at the end or that unmovable files are preventing the shrink operation. Try running Disk Defragmenter.
- **"The volume cannot be shrunk because the file system on it does not support this operation."** This error typically occurs with older file systems. Ensure the partition uses NTFS.
- **Slow Shrink Operation:** The shrinking process can take a long time, especially for large partitions or heavily fragmented drives.

## Conclusion

Shrinking partitions using Diskpart is a powerful and flexible method for managing disk space in Windows. By following these steps and understanding the considerations involved, you can safely resize your partitions and optimize your storage configuration. Remember to always back up your data before making any changes to your disk!
