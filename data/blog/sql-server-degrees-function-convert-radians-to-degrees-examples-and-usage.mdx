# SQL Server DEGREES() Function: Convert Radians to Degrees - Examples & Usage

The SQL Server `DEGREES()` function is a built-in mathematical function that simplifies the conversion of radian values to their equivalent degree values. This is particularly useful in scenarios involving geometry, physics, or any application requiring trigonometric calculations within your SQL Server database. This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and using the `DEGREES()` function with clear examples and explanations.

## Understanding Radians and Degrees

Before diving into the specifics of the `DEGREES()` function, let's briefly review the concepts of radians and degrees.

- **Degrees:** A degree is a common unit for measuring angles, with a full circle encompassing 360 degrees.

- **Radians:** A radian is another unit for measuring angles. One radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. A full circle is equal to 2π (approximately 6.28319) radians.

The relationship between degrees and radians is:

- 1 radian = (180 / π) degrees ≈ 57.2958 degrees
- 1 degree = (π / 180) radians ≈ 0.01745 radians

## Syntax of the DEGREES() Function

The syntax for the `DEGREES()` function in SQL Server is straightforward:

```sql
DEGREES ( numeric_expression )
```

Where `numeric_expression` is any expression that evaluates to a numeric value representing an angle in radians. This expression can be a constant, a variable, or a column name. The data type of `numeric_expression` can be any numeric type that can be implicitly converted to `float`.

## Return Value

The `DEGREES()` function returns a value of type `float` representing the equivalent angle in degrees.

## Examples of Using the DEGREES() Function

Let's explore several practical examples demonstrating the usage of the `DEGREES()` function in SQL Server.

**Example 1: Converting a Constant Radian Value**

This example converts the radian value `PI()/2` (which represents 90 degrees) to degrees.

```sql
SELECT DEGREES(PI()/2) AS Degrees;
```

**Output:**

```
Degrees
----------------------
90

(1 row affected)
```

As expected, the result is 90 degrees.

**Example 2: Converting a Variable Radian Value**

This example declares a variable `@Radians` and assigns it a radian value. Then, it uses the `DEGREES()` function to convert this variable to degrees.

```sql
DECLARE @Radians FLOAT;
SET @Radians = PI()/4; -- 45 degrees in radians

SELECT DEGREES(@Radians) AS Degrees;
```

**Output:**

```
Degrees
----------------------
45

(1 row affected)
```

The result confirms the conversion of `PI()/4` radians to 45 degrees.

**Example 3: Converting Values from a Table Column**

This example demonstrates how to use the `DEGREES()` function to convert radian values stored in a table column to degrees. First, we create a sample table named `Angles` with a column named `Radians`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Angles (
    AngleID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Radians FLOAT
);

INSERT INTO Angles (Radians) VALUES
(0),
(PI()/6),  -- 30 degrees
(PI()/4),  -- 45 degrees
(PI()/3),  -- 60 degrees
(PI()/2),  -- 90 degrees
(PI());    -- 180 degrees
```

Now, we can use the `DEGREES()` function to convert the `Radians` values to degrees and display them:

```sql
SELECT AngleID, Radians, DEGREES(Radians) AS Degrees
FROM Angles;
```

**Output:**

```
AngleID  Radians                Degrees
-------- ---------------------- ----------------------
1        0                      0
2        0.5235987755982988     30
3        0.7853981633974483     45
4        1.0471975511965976     60
5        1.5707963267948966     90
6        3.141592653589793      180

(6 rows affected)
```

This output shows the `Radians` value alongside its converted `Degrees` value for each row in the `Angles` table.

**Example 4: Using DEGREES() with other Mathematical Functions**

The `DEGREES()` function can be combined with other mathematical functions, such as `SIN()`, `COS()`, and `TAN()`, to perform complex trigonometric calculations. For example, let's calculate the sine of an angle given in degrees:

```sql
DECLARE @AngleInDegrees FLOAT = 30;
DECLARE @AngleInRadians FLOAT = RADIANS(@AngleInDegrees); -- Convert degrees to radians

SELECT SIN(@AngleInRadians) AS SineValue;

-- Alternatively: Calculate sine directly from degrees (less readable, but possible)
-- SELECT SIN(RADIANS(@AngleInDegrees)) AS SineValue;
```

**Output:**

```
SineValue
----------------------
0.49999999999999994

(1 row affected)
```

This example first converts the angle from degrees to radians using the `RADIANS()` function (the inverse of `DEGREES()`) and then calculates the sine of the resulting radian value. The result is approximately 0.5, which is the sine of 30 degrees.

**Example 5: Handling NULL Values**

If the `numeric_expression` passed to the `DEGREES()` function is `NULL`, the function will return `NULL`. It's good practice to handle potential `NULL` values in your data to avoid unexpected results.

```sql
DECLARE @NullRadians FLOAT = NULL;

SELECT DEGREES(@NullRadians) AS Degrees;
```

**Output:**

```
Degrees
----------------------
NULL

(1 row affected)
```

To prevent `NULL` values from propagating through your calculations, you can use functions like `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` to provide a default value when the input is `NULL`.

```sql
DECLARE @NullRadians FLOAT = NULL;

SELECT DEGREES(ISNULL(@NullRadians, 0)) AS Degrees; -- Replace NULL with 0

-- OR

SELECT DEGREES(COALESCE(@NullRadians, 0)) AS Degrees; -- Replace NULL with 0
```

**Output (for both examples):**

```
Degrees
----------------------
0

(1 row affected)
```

In this case, if `@NullRadians` is `NULL`, it's replaced with 0 before being passed to the `DEGREES()` function, resulting in a degree value of 0.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Data Type:** Ensure that the `numeric_expression` you pass to the `DEGREES()` function is a numeric data type that can be implicitly converted to `float`. If the expression is of a different data type (e.g., string), you might need to explicitly convert it using `CAST()` or `CONVERT()`.

- **NULL Handling:** Always consider the possibility of `NULL` values in your data and handle them appropriately using functions like `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` to prevent unexpected results.

- **Performance:** In most cases, the performance impact of the `DEGREES()` function is negligible. However, if you are performing a large number of conversions within a loop or in a complex query, it's always good to benchmark your code to ensure optimal performance.

- **Accuracy:** The `DEGREES()` function returns a `float` value, which has limited precision. If you require higher precision, consider using the `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC` data types for your radian values and applying appropriate rounding techniques if necessary.
