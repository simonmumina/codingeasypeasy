# Implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) with Spring Boot: A Comprehensive Guide

Server-Sent Events (SSE) offer a simple and efficient way to push real-time data from a server to a client over a single HTTP connection. Unlike WebSockets, SSE is unidirectional (server-to-client), making it ideal for scenarios like live updates, news feeds, and stock tickers where the client primarily consumes data. This blog post provides a detailed guide on implementing SSE in Spring Boot, complete with code examples and best practices.

## What are Server-Sent Events (SSE)?

SSE is a standard that allows a server to push data to a client over a single HTTP connection. The connection remains open, and the server sends updates as they become available. The client, typically a web browser, listens for these updates and processes them accordingly.

**Key Advantages of SSE:**

*   **Simplicity:** Easier to implement compared to WebSockets.
*   **HTTP-based:** Leverages the existing HTTP infrastructure and protocols.
*   **Unidirectional:** Ideal for server-to-client communication, simplifying the implementation.
*   **Automatic Reconnection:** Clients typically handle automatic reconnection attempts if the connection is lost.

## Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
*   Maven or Gradle
*   Basic understanding of Spring Boot

## Setting up a Spring Boot Project

1.  **Create a new Spring Boot project:** You can use Spring Initializr ([https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/)) to generate a basic Spring Boot project. Add the `web` dependency.

2.  **Project Structure:** Organize your project as you normally would. A typical structure might look like this:

    ```
    src/
    ├── main/
    │   ├── java/
    │   │   └── com/example/sse/
    │   │       ├── SseApplication.java
    │   │       ├── controller/
    │   │       │   └── SseController.java
    │   │       └── service/
    │   │           └── NotificationService.java
    │   └── resources/
    │       └── application.properties
    └── pom.xml (Maven) or build.gradle (Gradle)
    ```

## Implementing the SSE Endpoint

Here's how to create an SSE endpoint in Spring Boot using `SseEmitter`.

1.  **Create a Controller:**  This controller will handle the SSE endpoint.

    ```java
    package com.example.sse.controller;

    import com.example.sse.service.NotificationService;
    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
    import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
    import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.SseEmitter;

    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/sse")
    public class SseController {

        private final NotificationService notificationService;

        @Autowired
        public SseController(NotificationService notificationService) {
            this.notificationService = notificationService;
        }

        @GetMapping(value = "/subscribe", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)
        public SseEmitter subscribe() {
            SseEmitter emitter = new SseEmitter(Long.MAX_VALUE); // Or set a reasonable timeout

            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
            executor.execute(() -> {
                try {
                    notificationService.addEmitter(emitter);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    emitter.completeWithError(e);
                } finally {
                    executor.shutdown();
                }
            });

            emitter.onCompletion(() -> notificationService.removeEmitter(emitter));
            emitter.onTimeout(() -> {
                notificationService.removeEmitter(emitter);
                emitter.complete();
            });
            emitter.onError((e) -> notificationService.removeEmitter(emitter));

            return emitter;
        }
    }
    ```

    *   **`@RestController`**: Marks the class as a REST controller.
    *   **`@RequestMapping("/sse")`**:  Maps requests to the `/sse` path.
    *   **`@GetMapping(value = "/subscribe", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)`**:  Handles GET requests to `/sse/subscribe` and specifies that the response will be a stream of server-sent events (`MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE`).
    *   **`SseEmitter`**:  A Spring class used to send SSE events. It holds the connection open and allows the server to push data.
    *   **`Long.MAX_VALUE`:** Sets the timeout for the emitter. You should use a reasonable timeout in a real application (e.g., 30 minutes).
    *   **`onCompletion`, `onTimeout`, `onError`:** Handlers to properly manage the emitter's lifecycle, ensuring resources are released when the connection is closed or encounters an error.  Crucially important for avoiding memory leaks.
    *   **`ExecutorService`:**  Executes the code that adds the emitter to the service in a separate thread. This prevents blocking the main request thread.

2. **Create a Service (Optional but recommended for managing Emitters):** This service will manage the list of active `SseEmitter` instances and send notifications.

    ```java
    package com.example.sse.service;

    import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
    import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.SseEmitter;

    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

    @Service
    public class NotificationService {

        private final List<SseEmitter> emitters = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

        public void addEmitter(SseEmitter emitter) {
            this.emitters.add(emitter);

            // Send a heartbeat event to keep the connection alive
            try {
                emitter.send(SseEmitter.event().name("keep-alive").data(""));
            } catch (IOException e) {
                emitter.completeWithError(e);
                emitters.remove(emitter);
            }
        }

        public void removeEmitter(SseEmitter emitter) {
            this.emitters.remove(emitter);
        }

        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            List<SseEmitter> deadEmitters = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>(); // Avoid ConcurrentModificationException
            emitters.forEach(emitter -> {
                try {
                    emitter.send(SseEmitter.event().data(message));
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    // Handle disconnection
                    emitter.completeWithError(e);
                    deadEmitters.add(emitter);
                }
            });

            emitters.removeAll(deadEmitters);
        }
    }
    ```

    *   **`emitters`**:  A list to store active `SseEmitter` instances.  `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is used to allow concurrent modifications safely.
    *   **`addEmitter`**: Adds a new emitter to the list.  Importantly, it sends a "keep-alive" event to prevent the connection from timing out. This is a vital step.
    *   **`removeEmitter`**: Removes an emitter from the list when the client disconnects or an error occurs.
    *   **`sendNotification`**: Sends a notification to all connected clients.  It iterates through the `emitters` list and sends the message using `SseEmitter.event().data(message)`.
    *   **`deadEmitters`**: A list to store emitters that have encountered an error. This prevents a `ConcurrentModificationException` when iterating and removing emitters simultaneously.
    *   **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling for `IOException`, which can occur if a client disconnects.  It completes the emitter with the error and removes it from the list.  This prevents further attempts to send data to a closed connection.

## Sending SSE Events

To send an SSE event, you can call the `sendNotification` method in the `NotificationService`.

```java
    // Example Usage (e.g., from another controller or service)
    @Autowired
    private NotificationService notificationService;

    // ... some logic that triggers a notification ...
    public void triggerNotification(String message) {
        notificationService.sendNotification(message);
    }
```

## Configuration (application.properties or application.yml)

Configure the Spring Boot application to handle SSE connections.  These configurations prevent common issues:

```properties
server.servlet.session.tracking-modes=none # Disable session tracking for SSE
spring.mvc.async.request-timeout=-1  # Disable request timeout for long-lived SSE connections. Use SseEmitter's timeout instead.
```

*   **`server.servlet.session.tracking-modes=none`**: Disables session tracking.  SSE doesn't typically require sessions and disabling them can improve performance.
*   **`spring.mvc.async.request-timeout=-1`**:  Disables the default request timeout.  Important because SSE connections are long-lived.  You should manage the timeout using `SseEmitter`'s timeout instead.

## Client-Side Implementation (JavaScript)

Here's how to consume SSE events in JavaScript:

```javascript
  const eventSource = new EventSource('/sse/subscribe');

  eventSource.onopen = () => {
    console.log('SSE connection opened');
  };

  eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log('Received event:', event.data);
    // Process the event data here (e.g., update the UI)
  };

  eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error('SSE error:', error);
    eventSource.close(); // Close the connection on error
  };

  eventSource.addEventListener('keep-alive', (event) => {
      console.log('Received keep-alive signal');
  });

  // Optional: Close the connection when the user navigates away
  window.onbeforeunload = () => {
    eventSource.close();
  };
```

*   **`new EventSource('/sse/subscribe')`**: Creates a new `EventSource` object, connecting to the SSE endpoint.
*   **`onopen`**:  Called when the connection is successfully established.
*   **`onmessage`**:  Called when a new event is received.  The `event.data` property contains the event data.
*   **`onerror`**:  Called when an error occurs.  It's important to handle errors and close the connection to prevent resource leaks.
*  **`addEventListener('keep-alive')`**: Listens for the keep-alive events sent by the server.
*   **`window.onbeforeunload`**:  Closes the connection when the user closes the page or navigates away.

## Testing the Implementation

1.  **Run the Spring Boot application.**

2.  **Open a web browser** and use the JavaScript code to connect to the SSE endpoint.

3.  **Trigger a notification** (e.g., by calling the `triggerNotification` method from another endpoint or service).

4.  **Verify that the client** receives the notification and displays it correctly.  Use the browser's developer console to observe the events.

## Best Practices

*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling on both the server and client sides to handle disconnections, timeouts, and other potential issues.
*   **Heartbeat/Keep-Alive:** Send heartbeat events periodically to keep the connection alive and prevent timeouts. The `addEmitter` method in the `NotificationService` demonstrates this.
*   **Timeout Management:** Set appropriate timeouts for the `SseEmitter` and handle timeout events gracefully.  Avoid using the global Spring MVC request timeout; manage it per-emitter.
*   **Concurrency:**  Use appropriate concurrency mechanisms (e.g., `CopyOnWriteArrayList`) to manage the list of `SseEmitter` instances, especially in multi-threaded environments.
*   **Connection Limits:** Consider setting limits on the number of concurrent SSE connections to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   **Data Serialization:**  Use a suitable data serialization format (e.g., JSON) to structure the SSE event data.
*   **Buffering:** If sending large volumes of data, consider buffering the data on the server side to prevent overwhelming the client.
*   **Reconnection Strategy:**  Implement a reconnection strategy on the client-side to automatically reconnect if the connection is lost.  `EventSource` typically handles this automatically, but you might want to implement custom retry logic.
*   **Security:** Secure your SSE endpoints using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
