# Fixing Apache High CPU Usage: A Comprehensive Guide to Troubleshooting and Optimization

High CPU usage on an Apache web server can lead to slow website loading times, application errors, and ultimately, a poor user experience. Diagnosing and resolving these issues is crucial for maintaining a healthy and responsive web application. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of common causes, troubleshooting techniques, and optimization strategies to help you fix "Apache high CPU usage" problems.

## Understanding the Problem: Why is Apache Consuming So Much CPU?

Before diving into solutions, it's important to understand potential causes. Apache's high CPU usage can stem from several factors, often acting in combination:

*   **High Traffic:** A surge in website visitors can overwhelm the server, leading to increased CPU load. While this is a "good" problem to have, it still requires scaling.
*   **Inefficient Code:** Slow or poorly optimized PHP scripts, database queries, or other server-side code can bog down the CPU.
*   **Resource-Intensive Processes:**  Tasks like image processing, video transcoding, or large file downloads can strain the CPU.
*   **DoS/DDoS Attacks:** Malicious traffic can intentionally overload the server, causing a CPU spike.
*   **Misconfigured Apache Modules:**  Certain Apache modules, if improperly configured, can consume excessive CPU resources.
*   **Too Many Active Connections:**  Apache's prefork or worker MPM might be creating too many processes/threads, leading to resource contention.
*   **Lack of Caching:**  Frequent database queries and static file requests without caching can significantly increase CPU load.
*   **Slow Disk I/O:**  If the server's disk I/O is slow, Apache processes can spend a lot of time waiting for data, contributing to high CPU.
*   **Outdated Software:** Old versions of Apache, PHP, or other dependencies may contain bugs or lack performance optimizations.

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide

Here's a systematic approach to identifying the root cause of Apache's high CPU usage:

**1. Monitoring CPU Usage:**

   *   **`top` or `htop`:** These command-line tools provide a real-time view of CPU usage by process.  Connect to your server via SSH and run either `top` or `htop`. Look for processes named `httpd` or `apache2` consuming a high percentage of CPU.  `htop` generally offers a more visually appealing and interactive interface.

   ```bash
   top
   # or
   htop
   ```

   *   **`vmstat`:**  Provides system-wide statistics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O.

   ```bash
   vmstat 1  # Update every 1 second
   ```

   *   **`ps`:**  Allows you to filter and display information about Apache processes.

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep apache
   ```

   *   **Server Monitoring Tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic):**  These tools provide more comprehensive monitoring capabilities, including historical data, alerting, and visualization.  These are crucial for longer-term analysis and proactive issue identification.

**2. Identifying the Culprit Requests:**

   *   **Apache Access Logs:** Analyze the Apache access logs (`/var/log/apache2/access.log` or a similar path based on your configuration) to identify frequently requested URLs, large file downloads, or requests originating from suspicious IP addresses.

     ```bash
     tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep "200"  # Monitor successful requests in real-time
     awk '{print $7}' /var/log/apache2/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10  # Top 10 requested URLs
     ```

   *   **Apache Status Module (`mod_status`):** Enable the `mod_status` module in your Apache configuration (`/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf`) and configure it for access from a specific IP address or network. This module provides real-time information about the server's status, including active connections, request processing times, and CPU usage.

     ```apache
     <Location /server-status>
         SetHandler server-status
         Require ip 127.0.0.1  # Allow access from localhost
         # Add your IP here for remote access
         # Require ip 192.168.1.0/24  # Allow access from a network
     </Location>
     ```

     After enabling the module, access `/server-status` in your browser (from the allowed IP) to view the server status page. **Remember to restrict access to this page to prevent unauthorized information disclosure.**

   *   **Slow Query Logging (if using a database):** Enable slow query logging in your database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to identify queries that are taking a long time to execute.  These slow queries are often a major contributor to CPU load.

     *   **MySQL:** Add the following lines to your `my.cnf` or `my.ini` file (location varies depending on your system):

         ```ini
         slow_query_log = 1
         slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
         long_query_time = 2  # Log queries taking longer than 2 seconds
         ```

         Then, restart the MySQL server.

**3. Analyzing Code Performance (PHP, Python, etc.):**

   *   **Xdebug (for PHP):** Xdebug is a powerful PHP extension that allows you to profile your code and identify performance bottlenecks. Install and configure Xdebug on your server and use a profiler tool (e.g., Webgrind, KCachegrind) to analyze the generated profile data.

   *   **Profiling Tools for Other Languages:** Python has `cProfile`, and other languages have similar profiling libraries.  Utilize these to identify bottlenecks within your application code.

**4. Checking Resource Limits:**

   *   **`ulimit`:**  The `ulimit` command allows you to view and set resource limits for users and processes.  Ensure that Apache processes have sufficient resources (e.g., open file descriptors, memory) to operate efficiently.

   ```bash
   ulimit -a  # Show all limits
   ulimit -n  # Show open file descriptor limit
   ```

   You may need to adjust these limits in `/etc/security/limits.conf` and restart Apache.

## Optimization Techniques

Once you've identified the cause of the high CPU usage, you can implement the following optimization techniques:

**1. Caching:**

   *   **Browser Caching:** Configure Apache to serve static files (images, CSS, JavaScript) with appropriate cache headers to instruct browsers to cache these files locally.

     ```apache
     <FilesMatch "\.(ico|pdf|flv|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|swf)$">
         Header set Cache-Control "max-age=604800, public"
     </FilesMatch>
     <FilesMatch "\.(js|css)$">
         Header set Cache-Control "max-age=2592000, public"
     </FilesMatch>
     ```

   *   **Server-Side Caching (e.g., Memcached, Redis):**  Use a server-side caching system to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the load on the database.  PHP frameworks often have built-in support for these caching systems.

     *   **Example using Redis in PHP (using predis library):**

         ```php
         <?php
         require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Assuming you're using Composer

         use Predis\Client;

         $redis = new Client([
             'scheme' => 'tcp',
             'host'   => '127.0.0.1',
             'port'   => 6379,
         ]);

         $key = 'my_cached_data';
         $data = $redis->get($key);

         if (!$data) {
             // Data not in cache, fetch from database
             $data = fetchDataFromDatabase(); // Replace with your actual database query
             $redis->setex($key, 3600, $data); // Cache for 1 hour
         }

         echo $data;
         ?>
         ```

   *   **Page Caching (e.g., Varnish, Nginx as a reverse proxy):** Implement full-page caching to serve static HTML copies of frequently accessed pages. Varnish is a powerful HTTP accelerator that can significantly reduce CPU load. Nginx can also be configured as a reverse proxy with caching capabilities.

**2. Optimizing Code:**

   *   **Database Query Optimization:** Analyze slow queries and optimize them by adding indexes, rewriting queries, or using caching.
   *   **Code Profiling and Optimization:** Use profiling tools to identify and optimize slow code sections.
   *   **Minimize HTTP Requests:**  Reduce the number of HTTP requests by combining CSS and JavaScript files, using CSS sprites, and inlining small images (using data URIs).
   *   **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  Distribute static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) across a CDN to reduce the load on your origin server and improve loading times for users around the world.

**3. Apache Configuration Tuning:**

   *   **MPM (Multi-Processing Module) Configuration:**  Choose the appropriate MPM based on your server's resources and workload.  Common options include:

     *   **`prefork`:**  Uses multiple processes to handle requests.  Suitable for applications that are not thread-safe or when you need to isolate processes for security reasons.
     *   **`worker`:** Uses multiple threads within each process.  More efficient than `prefork` but requires thread-safe applications.
     *   **`event`:**  Similar to `worker` but uses asynchronous I/O for improved performance.

     Configure the `MaxRequestWorkers` (or `MaxClients` for `prefork`) directive to control the maximum number of concurrent requests that Apache can handle.  Setting this value too high can lead to memory exhaustion, while setting it too low can limit performance.  Experiment to find the optimal value for your server.

     ```apache
     <IfModule mpm_prefork_module>
         StartServers             5
         MinSpareServers          5
         MaxSpareServers         10
         MaxRequestWorkers       150
         MaxConnectionsPerChild   0
     </IfModule>

     <IfModule mpm_worker_module>
         StartServers             3
         MinSpareThreads         75
         MaxSpareThreads        250
         ThreadsPerChild         25
         MaxRequestWorkers       400
         MaxConnectionsPerChild   0
     </IfModule>

     <IfModule mpm_event_module>
         StartServers             3
         MinSpareThreads         75
         MaxSpareThreads        250
         ThreadsPerChild         25
         MaxRequestWorkers       400
         MaxConnectionsPerChild   0
     </IfModule>
     ```

     **Important:** The optimal MPM and configuration depend heavily on your specific server hardware, software stack, and traffic patterns. Monitoring and testing are crucial.

   *   **KeepAlive:**  Enable `KeepAlive` to allow persistent HTTP connections.  This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections for each request. However, excessive KeepAlive can tie up server resources. Configure `KeepAliveTimeout` and `MaxKeepAliveRequests` appropriately.

     ```apache
     KeepAlive On
     MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
     KeepAliveTimeout 5
     ```

   *   **Disable Unnecessary Modules:**  Disable Apache modules that are not being used to reduce memory footprint and CPU overhead. Use `a2dismod` to disable modules.

     ```bash
     a2dismod status  # Disable the status module if not needed
     systemctl restart apache2  # Restart Apache after disabling modules
     ```

   *   **Enable HTTP/2:**  HTTP/2 provides several performance improvements over HTTP/1.1, including header compression, multiplexing, and server push. Enable HTTP/2 in your Apache configuration.  This usually involves enabling the `mod_http2` module and configuring your virtual hosts.

   *   **Use a Reverse Proxy (Nginx):**  Consider using Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of Apache. Nginx is known for its high performance and ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.  Nginx can handle static content, caching, and load balancing, offloading these tasks from Apache.

**4. Hardware Considerations:**

   *   **Upgrade Hardware:** If your server is consistently overloaded, consider upgrading the hardware, including the CPU, RAM, and storage.
   *   **Use SSDs:** Solid-state drives (SSDs) provide much faster I/O performance than traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), which can significantly improve website loading times and reduce CPU load.

**5. Security Measures:**

   *   **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help protect your server from malicious traffic, such as DDoS attacks and SQL injection attempts, which can cause high CPU usage.
   *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abusive traffic from overwhelming the server.  `mod_evasive` can be used for this purpose.

     ```bash
     apt-get install libapache2-mod-evasive
     a2enmod evasive
     systemctl restart apache2
     ```

     Configure `/etc/apache2/mods-available/evasive.conf` with settings appropriate for your server.

   *   **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update Apache, PHP, and other server software to patch security vulnerabilities and take advantage of performance improvements.

## Example: Diagnosing and Fixing a Slow PHP Script

Let's say your Apache logs and `top` command indicate high CPU usage is correlated with requests to `/process_data.php`.  This suggests the script itself is the problem.

**1. Profile the PHP script using Xdebug:**

Follow the Xdebug installation and configuration instructions.  Then, use a profiler like Webgrind or KCachegrind to analyze the output.

**2. Identify the bottleneck:**

The profiler will show you which functions or code blocks are taking the most time. Let's assume you find that a specific database query within `process_data.php` is very slow.

**3. Optimize the query:**

Examine the query and consider the following:

*   **Add indexes:**  Ensure that the columns used in the `WHERE` clause of the query are indexed.

    ```sql
    -- Example: Add an index on the 'user_id' column in the 'orders' table
    CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON orders (user_id);
    ```

*   **Rewrite the query:**  Simplify the query, avoid using `SELECT *`, and use joins efficiently.

*   **Use caching:**  Cache the results of the query if the data doesn't change frequently.

**4. Implement the changes:**

Apply the optimizations to your PHP script and retest to confirm that CPU usage has decreased.

**process_data.php (example with caching):**

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Assuming you're using Composer
use Predis\Client;

$redis = new Client([
    'scheme' => 'tcp',
    'host'   => '127.0.0.1',
    'port'   => 6379,
]);

$user_id = $_GET['user_id'];
$cache_key = 'orders_for_user_' . $user_id;
$orders = $redis->get($cache_key);

if (!$orders) {
    // Fetch orders from the database
    $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydb', 'user', 'password');
    $stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT order_id, order_date FROM orders WHERE user_id = :user_id"); // Select only necessary columns
    $stmt->bindParam(':user_id', $user_id);
    $stmt->execute();
    $orders = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    $redis->setex($cache_key, 600, serialize($orders)); // Cache for 10 minutes (serialized)
} else {
    $orders = unserialize($orders);
}

header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($orders);
?>
```
