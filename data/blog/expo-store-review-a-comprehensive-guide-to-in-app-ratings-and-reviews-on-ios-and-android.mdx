# Expo Store Review: A Comprehensive Guide to In-App Ratings and Reviews on iOS and Android

Building a successful mobile app involves more than just creating a functional and engaging user interface. User feedback and app store ratings play a crucial role in attracting new users and improving the overall app experience. Encouraging users to leave reviews can significantly impact your app's visibility and credibility. Fortunately, the `expo-store-review` package makes it incredibly simple to implement in-app rating and review prompts within your Expo React Native applications for both iOS and Android.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know about the `expo-store-review` package, including installation, usage, best practices, and common troubleshooting tips.

## Why Use In-App Ratings and Reviews?

Before diving into the technical details, let's understand the benefits of implementing in-app rating and review prompts:

- **Improved App Store Ranking:** Higher ratings and positive reviews directly impact your app's visibility in app store search results.
- **Increased Downloads:** Apps with better ratings are more likely to be downloaded by potential users.
- **Valuable User Feedback:** Reviews provide valuable insights into user experience, allowing you to identify areas for improvement and address bugs.
- **Enhanced Credibility:** Positive reviews build trust and confidence in your app, encouraging more users to try it out.
- **Reduced Negative Reviews (Potentially):** By proactively asking for reviews, you can identify dissatisfied users and address their concerns before they leave a negative review in the app store.

## Introducing `expo-store-review`

The `expo-store-review` package is a convenient and platform-agnostic way to request in-app reviews from your users. It abstracts away the platform-specific APIs (SKStoreReviewController on iOS and In-App Review API on Android) into a simple and easy-to-use JavaScript interface. It ensures your review prompts follow the respective platform guidelines, reducing the risk of violating store policies.

## Installation

Getting started with `expo-store-review` is straightforward:

1.  **Install the package:**

    ```plaintext
    npx expo install expo-store-review
    ```

    This command will automatically install the necessary native modules and configure your project.

2.  **(Optional) Install `expo-dev-client`:**

    For easier development and testing, especially on iOS, installing `expo-dev-client` is highly recommended:

    ```plaintext
    npx expo install expo-dev-client
    ```

    Then, start your Expo project with:

    ```plaintext
    npx expo start --dev-client
    ```

## Basic Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use `expo-store-review`:

```plaintext
import * as StoreReview from 'expo-store-review'
import { Button, Text, View, StyleSheet, Platform, Alert } from 'react-native'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [isAvailable, setIsAvailable] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function checkAvailability() {
      const available = await StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()
      setIsAvailable(available)
    }

    checkAvailability()
  }, [])

  const handleRequestReview = async () => {
    if (isAvailable) {
      StoreReview.requestReview()
        .then(() => {
          console.log('Review requested successfully!')
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error('Error requesting review:', error)
          if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
            Alert.alert(
              'Oops!',
              'Something went wrong requesting the review. Please try again later.',
              [{ text: 'OK', onPress: () => console.log('OK Pressed') }]
            )
          }
        })
    } else {
      Alert.alert(
        'Review Not Available',
        'In-app review is not currently available on this device or platform.',
        [{ text: 'OK', onPress: () => console.log('OK Pressed') }]
      )
      console.log('In-app review is not available on this device or platform.')
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Check if store review is available: {isAvailable ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
      <Button title="Request Review" onPress={handleRequestReview} disabled={!isAvailable} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `StoreReview`:** We import the `expo-store-review` module as `StoreReview`.
2.  **Check Availability:** The `StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()` function checks if in-app reviews are supported on the current device and platform. This is crucial because in-app reviews are not available in all scenarios (e.g., simulator, some Android versions, etc.). We use `useEffect` to call this function when the component mounts and store the result in the `isAvailable` state.
3.  **Request Review:** The `StoreReview.requestReview()` function triggers the native in-app review prompt. It returns a promise that resolves if the request is successful and rejects if there's an error. The example includes basic error handling. Note that the prompt may not always be shown to the user, even if the request is successful. The operating system has its own logic for determining when to display the prompt to avoid annoying users.
4.  **Conditional Button:** The `Button` component is disabled if `isAvailable` is false, preventing the user from attempting to request a review when it's not supported.
5.  **Alerts:** The code includes `Alert` components to inform the user if a review is not available or if an error occurs during the review request process. This improves the user experience and provides helpful feedback.
6.  **Platform Specific Error Handling:** The error handling is conditionally implemented based on the platform. iOS requires specific error handling around the review request, which this implementation handles through an alert.

## Best Practices

To maximize the effectiveness of in-app review prompts and avoid frustrating your users, consider these best practices:

- **Timing is Key:** Don't bombard users with review requests immediately after they open the app. Instead, trigger the prompt after they've had a positive experience, such as completing a task, reaching a milestone, or using the app for a certain period.
- **Frequency Matters:** Avoid repeatedly prompting users who have already submitted a review or declined to do so. Store their response locally and respect their decision. The iOS system, in particular, limits how often a user sees the prompt.
- **Provide Value First:** Ensure your app delivers value to users before requesting a review. A positive user experience increases the likelihood of a positive review.
- **Explain Why:** Briefly explain to users why their feedback is valuable and how it helps improve the app. For example, "We'd love to hear your feedback to help us make the app even better!"
- **Conditional Logic:** Use conditional logic to target specific user segments or app versions with review requests. For example, you might want to exclude users who are still in a trial period or who have recently experienced a bug.
- **Consider Alternative Feedback Mechanisms:** If a user consistently declines to leave a review, consider offering alternative feedback channels, such as a contact form or a direct email address.
- **Test and Iterate:** Experiment with different triggers and messages to find what works best for your app and target audience. Monitor your app store ratings and reviews to assess the impact of your changes.
- **Respect Platform Guidelines:** Adhere to the platform-specific guidelines for requesting in-app reviews (Apple App Store Review Guidelines and Google Play In-App Review API guidelines). Violating these guidelines can result in app rejection or removal from the app store.

## Advanced Usage and Customization

While `expo-store-review` provides a simple interface for requesting reviews, you can customize the experience to better suit your app's needs:

- **Custom Triggers:** Instead of relying on simple timers or event triggers, you can create more sophisticated logic based on user behavior, app usage patterns, and other factors. For instance, you might only prompt users who have completed a specific number of tasks or spent a certain amount of time in the app.
- **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different review request messages and triggers to identify the most effective approach. You can use A/B testing frameworks to compare the performance of different variations and optimize your review strategy.
- **User Segmentation:** Target specific user segments with tailored review requests based on their demographics, behavior, or app usage patterns. For example, you might want to offer a different message to new users versus experienced users.
- **Integrating with Analytics:** Track the success rate of your review requests and analyze user feedback to identify areas for improvement. Integrate `expo-store-review` with your analytics platform to gain insights into how your review strategy is impacting your app's performance.

## Example: Implementing a Review Request Based on App Usage

This example demonstrates how to request a review after the user has opened the app a certain number of times. We'll use `AsyncStorage` to persist the app open count.

```plaintext
import * as StoreReview from 'expo-store-review'
import { Button, Text, View, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native'
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage' // Install with: npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

const APP_OPEN_COUNT_KEY = 'appOpenCount'
const REVIEW_REQUESTED_KEY = 'reviewRequested'
const OPEN_THRESHOLD = 5 // Request review after 5 opens

export default function App() {
  const [isAvailable, setIsAvailable] = useState(false)
  const [appOpenCount, setAppOpenCount] = useState(0)
  const [reviewRequested, setReviewRequested] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function checkAvailability() {
      const available = await StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()
      setIsAvailable(available)
    }

    async function loadData() {
      try {
        const openCount = await AsyncStorage.getItem(APP_OPEN_COUNT_KEY)
        const requested = await AsyncStorage.getItem(REVIEW_REQUESTED_KEY)

        setAppOpenCount(openCount ? parseInt(openCount, 10) : 0)
        setReviewRequested(requested === 'true' ? true : false)
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to load data from AsyncStorage:', e)
      }
    }

    checkAvailability()
    loadData()
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    async function saveData() {
      try {
        await AsyncStorage.setItem(APP_OPEN_COUNT_KEY, String(appOpenCount))
        await AsyncStorage.setItem(REVIEW_REQUESTED_KEY, reviewRequested ? 'true' : 'false')
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to save data to AsyncStorage:', e)
      }
    }

    saveData()
  }, [appOpenCount, reviewRequested])

  useEffect(() => {
    async function incrementAppOpenCount() {
      if (!reviewRequested) {
        // Don't increment if we already requested
        setAppOpenCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1)
      }
    }

    incrementAppOpenCount()
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isAvailable && appOpenCount >= OPEN_THRESHOLD && !reviewRequested) {
      requestReview()
    }
  }, [isAvailable, appOpenCount, reviewRequested])

  const requestReview = async () => {
    try {
      await StoreReview.requestReview()
      setReviewRequested(true) // Mark that we have requested the review
      Alert.alert('Thank You!', 'Thanks for using our app! Your feedback is appreciated.', [
        { text: 'OK', onPress: () => console.log('OK Pressed') },
      ])
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error requesting review:', error)
      // Handle errors (e.g., show an alert)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>App Open Count: {appOpenCount}</Text>
      <Text>Review Requested: {reviewRequested ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
      <Text>Is Review Available: {isAvailable ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
      <Button
        title="Force Request Review (for testing)"
        onPress={requestReview}
        disabled={reviewRequested || !isAvailable} // Can only request once
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

- **`AsyncStorage` Persistence:** Uses `AsyncStorage` to store the app open count and whether a review has already been requested. This ensures that the review is only requested once and that the count persists across app restarts. **Remember to install `AsyncStorage` with `npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.**
- **`APP_OPEN_COUNT_KEY` and `REVIEW_REQUESTED_KEY` Constants:** Defines constants for the keys used to store the data in `AsyncStorage`. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Loading and Saving Data:** Uses `useEffect` hooks to load the app open count and review requested status from `AsyncStorage` when the component mounts and to save the data whenever the count or status changes. Includes error handling for `AsyncStorage` operations.
- **Incrementing App Open Count:** Uses a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to increment the app open count each time the component mounts. This is triggered every time the app is opened.
- **Conditional Review Request:** Uses another `useEffect` hook to check if the app open count has reached the threshold and if a review hasn't already been requested. If both conditions are met, the `requestReview` function is called.
- **`reviewRequested` State:** The `reviewRequested` state variable keeps track of whether the review has already been requested, preventing multiple requests.
- **`setReviewRequested(true)` after successful request:** Crucially, the `setReviewRequested(true)` is called after the _attempt_ to request a review is made (regardless of whether the OS shows the prompt or not), preventing repeated prompts.
- **Threshold:** The `OPEN_THRESHOLD` constant defines the number of times the app must be opened before a review is requested. This allows you to control when the review prompt is displayed.
- **Force Request Button (for testing):** Includes a "Force Request Review" button for testing purposes. This button is disabled if a review has already been requested or if reviews aren't available. This allows you to trigger the review prompt manually to ensure that it's working correctly. Make sure to comment this out or remove it in production.
- **Alert on Successful Request:** Shows an alert to thank the user after the review is requested. This is important for user experience as it acknowledges their contribution.

**Important Considerations:**

- **`requestReview` behavior**: `StoreReview.requestReview()` does not guarantee the prompt will be shown. The OS determines whether the prompt appears based on factors such as frequency, user history, and other system-level criteria. This is by design to ensure a good user experience.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your review request logic on both iOS and Android devices (preferably physical devices). The simulator may not always accurately reflect the behavior of the in-app review prompt. Use the force request button for testing, but remove it before releasing to production.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle potential issues such as network errors, API failures, and device incompatibilities.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter while using `expo-store-review` and how to resolve them:

- **`StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()` returns `false`:** This indicates that in-app reviews are not supported on the current device or platform. This can happen in the following scenarios:

  - Running the app in the simulator.
  - Using an older version of iOS or Android that doesn't support in-app reviews.
  - The user has already submitted a review or declined to do so.
  - The user is on a test build (e.g. debug or internal testflight builds)

- **`StoreReview.requestReview()` doesn't show the prompt:** Even if `StoreReview.requestReview()` returns successfully, the prompt may not be displayed to the user. This is controlled by the operating system and is intended to prevent users from being bombarded with review requests. There's nothing you can do to force the prompt to appear.
- **App Store rejection:** If your app violates the App Store Review Guidelines regarding in-app reviews, it may be rejected. Make sure to follow the guidelines and avoid any practices that could be considered manipulative or abusive.

## Conclusion

Integrating in-app rating and review prompts is a simple yet powerful way to improve your app's visibility, credibility, and user experience. The `expo-store-review` package makes this process incredibly easy, allowing you to focus on building a great app without worrying about the complexities of platform-specific APIs. By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively encourage users to leave reviews and gather valuable feedback to help you make your app even better. Remember to test thoroughly, respect platform guidelines, and iterate based on your results. Good luck!
