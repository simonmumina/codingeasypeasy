# MySQL FROM_DAYS() Function: Convert Day Numbers to Dates with Examples

The `FROM_DAYS()` function in MySQL is a powerful tool for converting a day number into a date value. It's particularly useful when you need to calculate dates based on a specific number of days since the beginning of the year 0 (year 0 is considered January 1, 0000). This blog post will provide a comprehensive overview of the `FROM_DAYS()` function, including its syntax, practical examples, and common use cases.

## What is the MySQL FROM_DAYS() Function?

The `FROM_DAYS()` function takes a single numeric argument, representing the number of days since the beginning of year 0 (January 1, 0000). It then returns a date value corresponding to that day number.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
FROM_DAYS(N)
```

Where `N` is the day number.

## Understanding the Day Number

The day number is calculated starting from January 1, 0000. Therefore:

- Day number 1 corresponds to January 1, 0000.
- Day number 365 corresponds to December 31, 0000.
- Day number 366 corresponds to January 1, 0001.

This might seem a bit unusual, but it's the basis for how `FROM_DAYS()` works internally.

## Basic Examples

Let's start with some simple examples to illustrate how `FROM_DAYS()` works.

```plaintext
SELECT FROM_DAYS(730669); -- Returns '2000-01-01'
```

This query converts the day number 730669 to the date '2000-01-01'.

```plaintext
SELECT FROM_DAYS(0); -- Returns '0000-00-00'
```

A day number of 0 returns '0000-00-00', which is essentially an invalid date representation. Avoid using a day number of 0 in practical applications.

```plaintext
SELECT FROM_DAYS(1); -- Returns '0000-01-01'
```

Day number 1 corresponds to January 1, 0000.

## Practical Examples and Use Cases

Now, let's explore some more practical scenarios where `FROM_DAYS()` can be useful.

### 1. Calculating a Date from a Known Number of Days

Suppose you have a table with a column representing the number of days since a particular reference date, and you need to convert that into an actual date column.

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE event_log (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    event_name VARCHAR(255),
    days_since_epoch INT
);

INSERT INTO event_log (event_name, days_since_epoch) VALUES
('Event A', 737774),  -- Corresponds to 2020-01-01
('Event B', 737775),  -- Corresponds to 2020-01-02
('Event C', 737776);  -- Corresponds to 2020-01-03

SELECT
    id,
    event_name,
    FROM_DAYS(days_since_epoch) AS event_date
FROM
    event_log;
```

This query will return:

| id  | event_name | event_date |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1   | Event A    | 2020-01-01 |
| 2   | Event B    | 2020-01-02 |
| 3   | Event C    | 2020-01-03 |

### 2. Combining with Other Date Functions

You can combine `FROM_DAYS()` with other MySQL date functions for more complex date manipulations.

```plaintext
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(FROM_DAYS(737774), '%Y-%m-%d %W'); -- Returns '2020-01-01 Wednesday'
```

This example formats the resulting date from `FROM_DAYS()` using `DATE_FORMAT()` to display the day of the week.

### 3. Calculating Dates Relative to a Specific Starting Point

While `FROM_DAYS()` itself uses January 1, 0000 as the epoch, you can simulate using a different epoch by adjusting the day number. For instance, if you want to calculate dates relative to January 1, 1970 (the Unix epoch), you can calculate the difference in days between January 1, 1970, and January 1, 0000, and add that to your desired day offset.

```plaintext
-- Calculate the day number for January 1, 1970.
SELECT TO_DAYS('1970-01-01'); -- Returns 719528

--  Calculate a date that is 100 days after January 1, 1970.
SELECT FROM_DAYS(719528 + 100); -- Returns '1970-04-11'
```

Here, `TO_DAYS('1970-01-01')` returns the day number corresponding to January 1, 1970. We then add 100 to it and pass the result to `FROM_DAYS()` to get the date 100 days after January 1, 1970.

### 4. Storing Dates as Day Numbers for Efficiency

In some scenarios, storing dates as day numbers can be more efficient than storing them as date values, especially when dealing with large datasets. You can use `TO_DAYS()` to convert dates into day numbers and `FROM_DAYS()` to convert them back.

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE date_storage (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    event_date_as_day_number INT
);

INSERT INTO date_storage (event_date_as_day_number) VALUES
(TO_DAYS('2024-01-26'));

SELECT
    id,
    FROM_DAYS(event_date_as_day_number) AS event_date
FROM
    date_storage;
```

This example shows how to store a date as a day number and then retrieve it as a date using `FROM_DAYS()`. While this can sometimes improve storage efficiency, it's crucial to consider the readability and maintainability of your database schema.

## Important Considerations

- **Year 0:** Be aware that the `FROM_DAYS()` function uses the year 0 as its starting point. This is different from many other date systems and should be kept in mind when performing calculations.
- **Data Type:** The argument to `FROM_DAYS()` should be a numeric value. If you pass a string, MySQL will attempt to convert it to a number, which can lead to unexpected results.
- **Error Handling:** While `FROM_DAYS()` doesn't throw errors for excessively large numbers, the resulting date might be meaningless. Consider validating your input values to ensure they fall within a reasonable range. A number near zero will be valid but give an unusual date.
- **Alternatives:** For many common date manipulation tasks, other MySQL date functions like `DATE_ADD()`, `DATE_SUB()`, and `DATE()` may be more intuitive and easier to use. Consider the specific requirements of your task before choosing `FROM_DAYS()`.

## Conclusion

The `FROM_DAYS()` function in MySQL provides a way to convert a day number into a date value. While it may not be the most commonly used date function, it can be valuable in specific situations, such as calculating dates based on day offsets or storing dates as day numbers for potential efficiency gains. By understanding its syntax, behavior, and limitations, you can effectively leverage `FROM_DAYS()` in your MySQL applications. Remember to combine it with other date functions and consider alternative approaches to achieve the desired results efficiently and maintainably.
