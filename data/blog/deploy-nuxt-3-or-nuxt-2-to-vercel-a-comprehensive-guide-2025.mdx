# Deploying Your Nuxt.js Application to Vercel: A Comprehensive Guide

Vercel is a popular platform for deploying web applications, offering seamless integration with Git repositories and automatic deployments. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your Nuxt.js (Nuxt 3 or Nuxt 2) application to Vercel, covering everything from initial setup to advanced configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **A Vercel account:** You can sign up for a free account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
*   **A Nuxt.js project:** This guide assumes you already have a Nuxt.js project created. If not, you can quickly create one using the Nuxt CLI.
*   **Git repository:** Your Nuxt.js project should be hosted in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

Here's a step-by-step guide on deploying your Nuxt.js application to Vercel:

### 1. Connect Your Git Repository to Vercel

*   **Log in to Vercel:** Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and log in with your account.
*   **Create a New Project:** Click the "Add New..." button and select "Project."
*   **Import Repository:** Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and select the repository containing your Nuxt.js project.  You might need to grant Vercel access to your Git provider if this is your first time.

### 2. Configure Your Vercel Project

Vercel usually auto-detects a Nuxt project.  However, sometimes manual configuration is required, especially for Nuxt 2 projects.  Here's how to verify (and manually configure if necessary):

*   **Framework Preset:** Vercel should automatically detect your Nuxt.js project and select the appropriate framework preset (usually "Nuxt.js"). If it doesn't, select it manually.
*   **Build Command:** Vercel usually sets the build command to `nuxt build`. Verify this is correct. For Nuxt 2, you might need to explicitly specify `nuxt build`.
*   **Output Directory:** This is the directory where your built application is located.  Vercel often detects it correctly as `.nuxt` for Nuxt 2 and `.output` for Nuxt 3.  **Double-check this setting!  This is a common source of errors.**

   *   **Nuxt 2:** Typically `.nuxt`
   *   **Nuxt 3:** Typically `.output`

### 3. Deploy Your Application

*   **Click "Deploy":** Once you've verified the configuration, click the "Deploy" button.  Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application.
*   **Monitor the Deployment:** Vercel provides a detailed deployment log.  You can monitor the progress of the build and deployment process in real-time.

### 4. Access Your Deployed Application

Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL where your application is live.  You can also configure a custom domain name for your application in the Vercel dashboard.

## Nuxt 2 vs. Nuxt 3 Considerations

While the core deployment process is similar, there are some specific considerations for Nuxt 2 and Nuxt 3:

*   **Output Directory:**  As mentioned earlier, the output directory is different for Nuxt 2 (`.nuxt`) and Nuxt 3 (`.output`).  Ensure this is correctly configured in your Vercel project settings.
*   **Node.js Version:**  Nuxt 3 requires a more recent version of Node.js than Nuxt 2.  Vercel usually defaults to a compatible version, but you can specify the Node.js version in your `vercel.json` file (see the Advanced Configuration section below).

## Advanced Configuration (Optional)

For more control over your deployment, you can use a `vercel.json` file in the root of your project.  This file allows you to configure various aspects of your deployment, such as routes, environment variables, and build settings.

Here's an example `vercel.json` file for a Nuxt 3 project:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "nuxt.config.ts", // Or nuxt.config.js if you are not using TypeScript
      "use": "@nuxt/vercel-builder"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/.output/server/index.mjs"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.ts": { "memory": 128, "maxDuration": 5 }
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.x" // or another supported Node.js version
  }
}
```

Key aspects explained:

*   **`version`**: Specifies the version of the Vercel configuration format.
*   **`builds`**: Defines how your application should be built.  The `@nuxt/vercel-builder` automatically handles building your Nuxt application for Vercel.  `src` specifies the entry point (your nuxt.config file).
*   **`routes`**: Configures how requests are routed to your application.  This example routes all requests to the serverless function generated by Nuxt.
*   **`functions`**: Sets configuration options specifically for serverless functions, like memory allocation and execution time. This is where your API endpoints go if you are using serverless functions.
*   **`engines`**: Allows you to specify the Node.js version to use for your deployment. This is useful if you have specific Node.js version requirements.

**Important Notes for `vercel.json`:**

*   **`@nuxt/vercel-builder`:** Using `@nuxt/vercel-builder` (or its earlier versions for Nuxt 2) is the recommended way to deploy Nuxt to Vercel, as it optimizes the build process and configuration for Vercel's platform.
*   **Nuxt 2 Configuration:**  For Nuxt 2, the `vercel.json` configuration might be slightly different. Consult the Nuxt 2 documentation and the Vercel documentation for specifics.  You often needed `@nuxtjs/vercel-builder` but it might not be maintained for latest Nuxt versions. Verify before usage.
*   **TypeScript:**  The `src` in `builds` will point to `nuxt.config.ts` if you're using TypeScript or `nuxt.config.js` otherwise.

### Setting Environment Variables

You can set environment variables for your application in the Vercel dashboard under the "Settings" tab, and then "Environment Variables."  These variables can be accessed in your Nuxt.js application using `process.env`.  This is crucial for storing API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.

```javascript
// Example usage in your Nuxt component
export default {
  mounted() {
    const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
    console.log('API Key:', apiKey);
  }
};
```

**Securing Environment Variables:**

*   **Never commit sensitive information directly into your Git repository.**  Use environment variables to keep your secrets safe.
*   **Use Vercel's built-in environment variable management to store and manage your environment variables securely.**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter during deployment and how to resolve them:

*   **"Module not found" errors:** This usually indicates a missing dependency.  Make sure all your project dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file and that you've run `npm install` or `yarn install` before deploying.  Also, make sure your build command correctly installs dependencies.

*   **Incorrect output directory:**  This is a very common issue. Double-check that your Vercel project settings are configured to use the correct output directory (`.nuxt` for Nuxt 2, `.output` for Nuxt 3).

*   **Deployment failing without specific errors:**  Check your Vercel logs carefully for any warnings or errors during the build process.  Sometimes, seemingly harmless warnings can cause deployments to fail.

*   **500 Errors or "Function invocation failed":** This usually indicates an issue with your serverless functions (if you're using them).  Check your function logs in the Vercel dashboard for more details. Common causes are missing environment variables, database connection errors, or errors in your function code.

*   **Client-side rendering issues:**  If your application relies heavily on client-side rendering, ensure that your routes are correctly configured in your `vercel.json` file to serve the correct files.

*   **Node.js version incompatibility:** If you are facing issues related to incompatible Node.js version, then specify it in vercel.json or in project settings

## Best Practices for Nuxt.js Deployment on Vercel

*   **Use a `.gitignore` file:**  Exclude unnecessary files and directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`) from your Git repository.
*   **Optimize your images:**  Use image optimization techniques to reduce image sizes and improve loading times.  Nuxt modules like `@nuxt/image` can help with this.
*   **Leverage Vercel's CDN:**  Vercel automatically uses a global CDN to serve your application, ensuring fast loading times for users around the world.
*   **Monitor your application:**  Use Vercel's built-in analytics or a third-party monitoring tool to track the performance of your application and identify any issues.
*   **Keep your dependencies up to date:** Regularly update your Nuxt.js dependencies to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches.

## Conclusion

Deploying your Nuxt.js application to Vercel is a straightforward process that can be further streamlined by using `@nuxt/vercel-builder`. By following the steps outlined in this guide and paying attention to the key considerations and best practices, you can ensure a smooth and successful deployment experience. Remember to carefully check your Vercel configuration, environment variables, and build logs to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.  Good luck!
