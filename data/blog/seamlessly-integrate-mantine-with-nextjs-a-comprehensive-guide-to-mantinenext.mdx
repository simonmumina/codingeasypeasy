# Seamlessly Integrate Mantine with Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide to @mantine/next

Mantine is a fully featured React UI library that provides everything you need to build modern web applications quickly and efficiently.  Next.js, on the other hand, is a popular React framework known for its server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and excellent developer experience.  Combining these two powerhouses can result in highly performant, visually appealing, and maintainable applications.

The `@mantine/next` package simplifies the integration process, handling common pain points such as theme configuration, server-side rendering, and CSS extraction. This guide will walk you through the installation, configuration, and usage of `@mantine/next`, allowing you to leverage the full potential of Mantine within your Next.js projects.

## Why Use @mantine/next?

While it's possible to integrate Mantine into Next.js manually, `@mantine/next` offers several significant advantages:

*   **Automatic Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**  Handles the complex task of rendering Mantine components on the server, ensuring optimal performance and SEO.  Without this, your initial page load might show unstyled content.
*   **CSS Extraction:**  Extracts CSS styles into separate files, improving performance and enabling better caching strategies. This is particularly important for production environments.
*   **Theme Configuration:**  Provides a seamless way to configure your Mantine theme and apply it consistently across your application.
*   **Simplified Setup:**  Reduces the boilerplate code required to get Mantine running in your Next.js project.
*   **TypeScript Support:**  Fully typed for a safer and more predictable development experience.

## Installation and Setup

Let's get started by installing the necessary packages.  We'll assume you already have a Next.js project set up. If not, create a new one:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-mantine-app
cd my-mantine-app
```

Next, install Mantine and `@mantine/next`:

```bash
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/next @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/notifications
# or
yarn add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/next @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/notifications
# or
pnpm add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/next @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/notifications
```

**Explanation of Packages:**

*   `@mantine/core`: Contains the core Mantine components like buttons, inputs, cards, etc.
*   `@mantine/hooks`: Provides a collection of useful React hooks for common UI tasks.
*   `@mantine/next`:  The package that integrates Mantine with Next.js, handling SSR and CSS extraction.
*   `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/server`: Emotion is the CSS-in-JS library Mantine uses.  `@emotion/server` is crucial for SSR.
*   `@mantine/notifications`: For displaying toasts and other notifications.  Optional, but commonly used.

## Configuring _app.tsx/_app.jsx

The most important step is to configure your `_app.tsx` (or `_app.jsx` for JavaScript projects) file.  This is where you wrap your application with the `MantineProvider` and configure `@mantine/next`.

Create or modify your `pages/_app.tsx` (or `pages/_app.jsx`) file:

```typescript jsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { Notifications } from '@mantine/notifications';
import { useEmotionCache } from '@mantine/core';
import { CacheProvider } from '@emotion/react';

export default function App(props: AppProps) {
  const { Component, pageProps } = props;
  const emotionCache = useEmotionCache();

  return (
    <CacheProvider value={emotionCache}>
      <MantineProvider
        withGlobalStyles
        withNormalizeCSS
        theme={{
          /** Put your mantine theme override here */
          colorScheme: 'light', // or 'dark'
        }}
      >
        <Notifications />
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MantineProvider>
    </CacheProvider>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`MantineProvider`:**  Wraps your entire application and provides the Mantine theme to all components.
    *   `withGlobalStyles`:  Injects global styles (reset CSS).  Highly recommended.
    *   `withNormalizeCSS`:  Applies a normalization CSS to ensure cross-browser consistency.  Recommended.
    *   `theme`:  Allows you to customize the Mantine theme.  We'll cover theme customization in more detail later.
*   **`Notifications`:**  Used for displaying notifications. If you are not using it, you can remove this component.
*   **`useEmotionCache` and `CacheProvider`:** This is crucial for server side rendering with Emotion.  It's required by `@mantine/next`.

**Important Note:** If you're using TypeScript, make sure you have the correct types installed. You might need to install `@types/react` and `@types/node` if you haven't already.

## Basic Usage: Adding a Mantine Component

Now that Mantine is set up, let's add a simple Mantine component to a page.  Modify your `pages/index.tsx` (or `pages/index.jsx`) file:

```typescript jsx
// pages/index.tsx
import { Button } from '@mantine/core';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Mantine + Next.js app!</h1>
      <Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Run your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

You should now see a button styled with Mantine's default theme on your homepage. Congratulations! You've successfully integrated Mantine into your Next.js project.

## Theme Customization

Mantine's theme is highly customizable.  You can modify colors, fonts, spacing, breakpoints, and much more. Let's customize the primary color:

```typescript jsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { Notifications } from '@mantine/notifications';
import { useEmotionCache } from '@mantine/core';
import { CacheProvider } from '@emotion/react';

export default function App(props: AppProps) {
  const { Component, pageProps } = props;
  const emotionCache = useEmotionCache();

  return (
    <CacheProvider value={emotionCache}>
      <MantineProvider
        withGlobalStyles
        withNormalizeCSS
        theme={{
          /** Put your mantine theme override here */
          colorScheme: 'light', // or 'dark'
          colors: {
            brand: ['#228be6', '#339af0', '#4dabf7', '#63e6be', '#51cf66', '#40c057', '#37b24d', '#2f9e44', '#2b8a3e', '#287935'], // Custom brand colors
          },
          primaryColor: 'brand', // Set primary color to the custom brand color
        }}
      >
        <Notifications />
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MantineProvider>
    </CacheProvider>
  );
}
```

In this example, we've defined a custom color palette called `brand` and set the `primaryColor` to use this palette. Now, any Mantine component that uses the primary color will use the colors you've defined.  Mantine also includes tools for creating and editing themes using UI components.  Explore the Mantine documentation for more advanced theme customization options.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Considerations

`@mantine/next` automatically handles most of the SSR complexities. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

*   **`getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`:** Mantine components will render correctly within `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`. No special configuration is required in most cases.
*   **Initial Load Performance:** SSR can improve initial load performance, but it's important to optimize your components and data fetching to avoid bottlenecks.
*   **FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content):** `@mantine/next` minimizes FOUC by extracting CSS styles and injecting them into the `<head>` of the HTML document during SSR.  However, it's still possible to experience a brief flash of unstyled content if your theme customization or data fetching is slow.  Make sure your theme definition is simple and efficient.

## Optimizing for Production

Here are some tips for optimizing your Mantine + Next.js application for production:

*   **CSS Extraction:** Ensure that `@mantine/next` is correctly configured to extract CSS styles into separate files. This allows for better caching and faster initial load times. You shouldn't need to do anything beyond what's described in the initial setup.
*   **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically handles code splitting, which means that only the code needed for a specific page is loaded. This can significantly improve performance, especially for large applications.
*   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js's built-in `next/image` component to optimize images.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for both your data and your static assets.  Next.js provides several caching options, including server-side caching and CDN integration.
*   **Production Build:** Always test your application thoroughly after building it for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn build
    yarn start
    # or
    pnpm build
    pnpm start
    ```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter when integrating Mantine with Next.js and how to solve them:

*   **"Class names do not match" error:** This error usually occurs when there's a mismatch between the CSS generated on the server and the CSS generated on the client. Ensure that you've correctly configured `@mantine/next` and that you're not using any custom CSS that might interfere with Mantine's styles.  Double check the emotion setup in `_app.tsx`.
*   **FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content):** As mentioned earlier, FOUC can occur if your theme customization or data fetching is slow. Try simplifying your theme and optimizing your data fetching. You can also explore using a loading indicator to hide the content until it's fully styled.  Check that `withGlobalStyles` and `withNormalizeCSS` are enabled.
*   **Mantine components not rendering correctly:** Double-check that you've wrapped your application with the `MantineProvider` in your `_app.tsx` (or `_app.jsx`) file.
*   **Typescript errors:**  Ensure you have the necessary `@types/*` packages installed (e.g. `@types/react`, `@types/node`).
