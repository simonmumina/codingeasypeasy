# JavaScript `Object.isSealed()`: Secure Your Objects Against Modifications - A Comprehensive Guide

In JavaScript, object immutability plays a vital role in ensuring data integrity, security, and predictability. The `Object.isSealed()` method provides a powerful mechanism to determine if an object is *sealed*. A sealed object is one that prevents the addition of new properties and prevents the configuration of existing properties to be anything other than writable (if it was writable) or configurable (if it was configurable). Existing property values can still be changed, as long as they are writable.

This comprehensive guide will delve deep into the `Object.isSealed()` method, exploring its functionality, use cases, and implications for writing more robust and secure JavaScript code.

## What is a Sealed Object?

Before diving into `Object.isSealed()`, it's crucial to understand what a *sealed* object is.  Simply put, a sealed object has the following characteristics:

*   **No New Properties Can Be Added:** You cannot add any new properties to a sealed object. Attempting to do so will either be ignored in non-strict mode or throw a `TypeError` in strict mode.
*   **Existing Properties Cannot Be Deleted or Reconfigured:**  You can't delete existing properties or change their configurability. A non-configurable property cannot become configurable, and a configurable property cannot become non-configurable.
*   **Existing Writable Properties Can Still Be Modified:** If an existing property is writable, its value can still be changed.  If it's not writable, then you won't be able to change its value.

Sealing an object doesn't make it completely immutable, but it significantly enhances its security by preventing structural changes.

## Understanding `Object.isSealed()`

The `Object.isSealed()` method checks if an object is sealed. It returns `true` if the object is sealed, and `false` otherwise.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
Object.isSealed(object)
```

**Parameter:**

*   `object`: The object to be checked.

**Return Value:**

*   A `Boolean` indicating whether the object is sealed.

## Basic Examples of `Object.isSealed()`

Let's illustrate the usage of `Object.isSealed()` with some basic examples:

```javascript
// 1. A Regular Object

const myObject = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
};

console.log(Object.isSealed(myObject)); // Output: false (Not sealed)

// 2. An Empty Object

const emptyObject = {};

console.log(Object.isSealed(emptyObject)); // Output: false (Not sealed)

// 3. Sealing an Object

Object.seal(myObject); // Seal the 'myObject'
console.log(Object.isSealed(myObject)); // Output: true (Now sealed)
```

In these examples, we first check if regular and empty objects are sealed (they aren't).  Then, we use `Object.seal()` to seal the `myObject` and verify that `Object.isSealed()` now returns `true`.

## Detailed Code Examples and Use Cases

Let's explore more practical scenarios to understand the power of `Object.isSealed()`.

**1. Preventing Accidental Property Additions:**

Imagine you have an object representing user data. You want to ensure that no new properties are accidentally added to it during processing.

```javascript
'use strict'; // Enable strict mode for error handling

const userData = {
  id: 123,
  username: 'john_doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
};

Object.seal(userData);

try {
  userData.phoneNumber = '555-123-4567'; // Attempt to add a new property
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error adding property:", error); // TypeError in strict mode
}

console.log(userData); // Output: { id: 123, username: 'john_doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' } (phoneNumber not added)
console.log(Object.isSealed(userData)); // Output: true
```

In this example, sealing `userData` prevents the addition of the `phoneNumber` property. In strict mode, a `TypeError` is thrown.

**2. Ensuring Data Integrity:**

Consider a configuration object that defines application settings. Sealing it prevents unintentional modifications to its structure.

```javascript
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000,
};

Object.seal(config);

try {
  delete config.apiUrl; // Attempt to delete a property
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error deleting property:", error); // TypeError in strict mode
}

config.timeout = 10000; // Modifying an existing writable property is allowed

console.log(config); // Output: { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', timeout: 10000 }
console.log(Object.isSealed(config)); // Output: true
```

While the `timeout` property's value can be changed, attempts to delete or add properties will fail (and throw an error in strict mode).

**3. Checking for Sealing in Functions:**

You can use `Object.isSealed()` within functions to conditionally execute logic based on whether an object is sealed.

```javascript
function processData(data) {
  if (Object.isSealed(data)) {
    console.log("Data is sealed. Read-only operations.");
    // Perform read-only operations on the data
  } else {
    console.log("Data is not sealed. Modification allowed.");
    // Perform read and write operations on the data
  }
}

const mutableData = { value: 10 };
processData(mutableData); // Output: "Data is not sealed. Modification allowed."

Object.seal(mutableData);
processData(mutableData); // Output: "Data is sealed. Read-only operations."
```

**4. Handling Nested Objects:**

It's important to note that `Object.seal()` only seals the top-level object.  Nested objects within the sealed object are not automatically sealed.

```javascript
const nestedObject = {
  outer: {
    inner: 123,
  },
};

Object.seal(nestedObject);

console.log(Object.isSealed(nestedObject)); // Output: true

nestedObject.outer.inner = 456; // Modifying the nested object is allowed

console.log(nestedObject); // Output: { outer: { inner: 456 } }
console.log(Object.isSealed(nestedObject.outer)); // Output: false (Inner object is not sealed)

Object.seal(nestedObject.outer);
console.log(Object.isSealed(nestedObject.outer)); // Output: true (Inner object is now sealed)
```

If you need to recursively seal an object, you'll have to iterate through its properties and seal each nested object individually.

**5.  Checking Sealed Status Before Mutation:**

A good practice is to use `Object.isSealed()` before attempting any operations that might mutate a sealed object.  This can prevent unexpected errors.

```javascript
function updateUserData(userData, newEmail) {
  if (Object.isSealed(userData)) {
    console.warn("Cannot update user data. Object is sealed.");
    return userData; // Or throw an error if appropriate
  }

  userData.email = newEmail;
  return userData;
}

const sealedUser = { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" };
Object.seal(sealedUser);

const updatedUser = updateUserData(sealedUser, "newbob@example.com"); // Attempt to update
console.log(updatedUser); // Output: { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' } (Email not updated)
```

## Comparing `Object.isSealed()` with `Object.isFrozen()` and `Object.isExtensible()`

It's crucial to differentiate `Object.isSealed()` from similar methods:

*   **`Object.isFrozen()`:**  Checks if an object is *frozen*. A frozen object is sealed and also has all its existing properties made non-writable.  Thus, you cannot change the *values* of the properties, in addition to the other restrictions of a sealed object. Frozen objects provide the highest level of immutability that JavaScript offers.

*   **`Object.isExtensible()`:** Checks if an object is *extensible*, meaning new properties can be added.  Sealing an object makes it non-extensible.

Here's a table summarizing the differences:

| Feature                | `Object.seal()`          | `Object.freeze()`           | `Object.preventExtensions()` |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| New properties allowed | No                       | No                            | No                         |
| Delete properties      | No                       | No                            | Yes                        |
| Reconfigure properties | No                       | No                            | Yes                        |
| Change property values | Yes (if writable)        | No                            | Yes                        |
| Immutability Level     | Moderate                 | Highest                       | Lowest                     |

## Best Practices for Using `Object.isSealed()`

*   **Understand the Scope:** `Object.seal()` only seals the top-level object.  Remember to handle nested objects accordingly.
*   **Use Strict Mode:** Enable strict mode (`'use strict';`) to get more informative error messages when attempting to violate the sealed state.
*   **Consider Alternatives:** Evaluate whether `Object.freeze()` is a better choice if you need complete immutability.
*   **Document Usage:** Clearly document when and why you are sealing objects in your code.
