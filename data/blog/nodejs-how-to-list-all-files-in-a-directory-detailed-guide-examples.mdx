# Node.js: How to List All Files in a Directory (Detailed Guide + Examples)

Node.js provides powerful tools for interacting with the file system, making it easy to read, write, and manipulate files and directories. A common task is listing all the files within a directory.  This blog post will guide you through various methods to achieve this, covering both synchronous and asynchronous approaches, error handling, and filtering options.

## Why List Files in a Directory?

Listing files in a directory is a fundamental operation with many applications:

*   **File Management:**  Building file explorers, utilities for backing up files, or tools for organizing content.
*   **Automation:** Creating scripts that process files in a directory, such as image processing, data analysis, or code generation.
*   **Indexing:** Building search engines or content management systems that need to index files.
*   **Monitoring:** Creating scripts to monitor directories for new files or changes to existing files.
*   **Security:** Scanning directories for malicious files based on file extensions or other characteristics.

## Methods for Listing Files in Node.js

Node.js provides the `fs` (File System) module, which offers several functions for reading directory contents. We'll explore the most common approaches:

1.  **`fs.readdirSync()` (Synchronous):**  Reads the directory contents synchronously, blocking the event loop until the operation completes.
2.  **`fs.readdir()` (Asynchronous):**  Reads the directory contents asynchronously, using a callback function to handle the results.
3.  **`fs.promises.readdir()` (Asynchronous with Promises):** Reads the directory contents asynchronously using promises, providing a more modern and cleaner syntax.

Let's dive into each method with code examples.

### 1. Using `fs.readdirSync()` (Synchronous)

The `fs.readdirSync()` method is the simplest way to list files in a directory. It reads the directory contents and returns an array of filenames.  However, be mindful that synchronous operations block the Node.js event loop, potentially impacting performance, especially for large directories.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const directoryPath = './my-directory'; // Replace with your directory path

try {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(directoryPath);

  console.log("Files in directory:");
  files.forEach(file => {
    console.log(file);
  });
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `require('fs')`:  Imports the `fs` module.
*   `path.join(__dirname, 'my-directory')`: Constructs the full path to the directory.  Using `path.join` is generally recommended for cross-platform compatibility.  We'll remove this `path.join` in subsequent examples since the provided `directoryPath` fulfills the purpose.
*   `fs.readdirSync(directoryPath)`:  Reads the directory contents synchronously and returns an array of filenames.
*   `try...catch`:  Handles potential errors during the directory reading process.  It's crucial to include error handling to prevent your application from crashing if the directory doesn't exist or if you lack permissions.
*   `files.forEach(file => { console.log(file); })`: Iterates through the array of filenames and prints each filename to the console.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Blocking Operation:**  `fs.readdirSync()` blocks the event loop, making your application unresponsive during the operation. Use this method cautiously, especially in production environments.  It's best suited for scripts or small CLI tools where performance is not critical.
*   **Error Handling:**  Always wrap the `fs.readdirSync()` call in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors.

### 2. Using `fs.readdir()` (Asynchronous with Callback)

The `fs.readdir()` method reads the directory contents asynchronously, preventing the event loop from blocking. It accepts a callback function that will be executed when the operation completes.  This is generally the preferred approach for most Node.js applications.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const directoryPath = './my-directory'; // Replace with your directory path

fs.readdir(directoryPath, (err, files) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
    return;
  }

  console.log("Files in directory:");
  files.forEach(file => {
    console.log(file);
  });
});

console.log("This message might appear before the files are listed."); // Illustrates asynchronous nature
```

**Explanation:**

*   `fs.readdir(directoryPath, (err, files) => { ... })`:  Reads the directory contents asynchronously. The second argument is a callback function that receives two arguments: an error object (`err`) and an array of filenames (`files`).
*   `if (err) { ... }`:  Checks for errors. If an error occurred, it logs the error message to the console and returns from the function.
*   `files.forEach(file => { console.log(file); })`: Iterates through the array of filenames and prints each filename to the console.
*   The `console.log` statement after the `fs.readdir` call demonstrates the asynchronous nature of the operation. The message will likely be printed before the files are listed because the `fs.readdir` operation is performed in the background.

**Advantages of Asynchronous Approach:**

*   **Non-Blocking:**  The event loop is not blocked, allowing your application to remain responsive.
*   **Scalability:**  More suitable for handling concurrent requests.

**Disadvantages of Asynchronous Approach:**

*   **Callback Hell:** Can lead to nested callbacks if multiple asynchronous operations are chained together. (This can be mitigated by using Promises or async/await).

### 3. Using `fs.promises.readdir()` (Asynchronous with Promises)

Node.js provides a promise-based API for the `fs` module through `fs.promises`. This allows you to use `async/await` syntax, making asynchronous code easier to read and manage.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

const directoryPath = './my-directory'; // Replace with your directory path

async function listFiles(directory) {
  try {
    const files = await fs.readdir(directory);

    console.log("Files in directory:");
    files.forEach(file => {
      console.log(file);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
  }
}

listFiles(directoryPath);
console.log("This message might appear before the files are listed."); // Illustrates asynchronous nature
```

**Explanation:**

*   `const fs = require('fs').promises;`:  Imports the promise-based `fs` API.
*   `async function listFiles(directory) { ... }`:  Defines an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword.
*   `const files = await fs.readdir(directory);`:  Reads the directory contents asynchronously using `await`. The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the function until the promise returned by `fs.readdir` resolves.
*   `try...catch`: Handles potential errors during the directory reading process.
*   `files.forEach(file => { console.log(file); })`: Iterates through the array of filenames and prints each filename to the console.
*   `listFiles(directoryPath);`: Calls the asynchronous function to list the files.

**Advantages of Promises/Async/Await:**

*   **Improved Readability:**  Makes asynchronous code easier to read and understand.
*   **Error Handling:**  Simplified error handling using `try...catch` blocks.
*   **Chaining Asynchronous Operations:**  Simplifies chaining asynchronous operations together.

## Filtering Files

Often, you'll need to filter the files based on certain criteria, such as file extension, modification date, or file size.  You can use the `fs.stat()` or `fs.promises.stat()` method to get file information and filter accordingly.

### Filtering by File Extension

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const path = require('path');

const directoryPath = './my-directory'; // Replace with your directory path
const fileExtension = '.txt'; // Filter for files with this extension

async function listFilesWithExtension(directory, extension) {
  try {
    const files = await fs.readdir(directory);

    const filteredFiles = files.filter(file => path.extname(file) === extension);

    console.log(`Files with extension ${extension}:`);
    filteredFiles.forEach(file => {
      console.log(file);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
  }
}

listFilesWithExtension(directoryPath, fileExtension);
```

**Explanation:**

*   `path.extname(file)`:  Gets the file extension of the file.
*   `files.filter(file => path.extname(file) === extension)`: Filters the array of filenames to include only files with the specified extension.

### Filtering by File Type (Files vs. Directories)

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const path = require('path');

const directoryPath = './my-directory'; // Replace with your directory path

async function listOnlyFiles(directory) {
  try {
    const files = await fs.readdir(directory);

    const filePromises = files.map(async file => {
      const filePath = path.join(directory, file);
      const fileStat = await fs.stat(filePath);
      return { file, isFile: fileStat.isFile() };
    });

    const fileResults = await Promise.all(filePromises);

    const onlyFiles = fileResults.filter(result => result.isFile).map(result => result.file);


    console.log("Only files (excluding directories):");
    onlyFiles.forEach(file => {
      console.log(file);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
  }
}

listOnlyFiles(directoryPath);
```

**Explanation:**

*   `fs.stat(filePath)`:  Gets the file statistics for the file.
*   `fileStat.isFile()`: Returns true if the entry is a file, false if it's a directory or other type of entry.
*   `Promise.all(filePromises)`:  Waits for all the `fs.stat` operations to complete before proceeding.  This is important because `fs.stat` is asynchronous.  We need to ensure we have the file stats for all files before filtering.

### Filtering by Size (Illustrative Example - requires actual files to be present)
This example demonstrates how you could filter based on file size, though in many cases you'd perform more advanced operations like logging/alerting on large files.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const path = require('path');

const directoryPath = './my-directory'; // Replace with your directory path
const maxSize = 1024; // Maximum file size in bytes

async function listSmallFiles(directory, maxSizeInBytes) {
  try {
    const files = await fs.readdir(directory);

    const filePromises = files.map(async file => {
      const filePath = path.join(directory, file);
      const fileStat = await fs.stat(filePath);
      return { file, size: fileStat.size };
    });

    const fileResults = await Promise.all(filePromises);

    const smallFiles = fileResults.filter(result => result.size <= maxSizeInBytes).map(result => result.file);

    console.log(`Files smaller than ${maxSizeInBytes} bytes:`);
    smallFiles.forEach(file => {
      console.log(file);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
  }
}

listSmallFiles(directoryPath, maxSize);
```

**Important Considerations for Filtering:**

*   **Performance:** Using `fs.stat` or `fs.promises.stat` inside a loop can impact performance, especially for large directories.  Consider alternative approaches for filtering if performance is critical.
*   **Error Handling:** Always handle potential errors during the `fs.stat` or `fs.promises.stat` calls.

## Recursive Directory Listing (Listing Files in Subdirectories)

To list files in subdirectories as well, you'll need to implement a recursive function. This function will call itself for each subdirectory it encounters.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;
const path = require('path');

async function listFilesRecursively(directory) {
  let files = [];

  async function traverseDirectory(dir) {
    const items = await fs.readdir(dir);

    for (const item of items) {
      const itemPath = path.join(dir, item);
      const itemStat = await fs.stat(itemPath);

      if (itemStat.isDirectory()) {
        await traverseDirectory(itemPath); // Recursive call
      } else {
        files.push(itemPath);
      }
    }
  }

  await traverseDirectory(directory);

  return files;
}

// Example Usage:
async function main() {
  const directoryPath = './my-directory'; // Replace with your directory path

  try {
    const allFiles = await listFilesRecursively(directoryPath);

    console.log("All files recursively:");
    allFiles.forEach(file => {
      console.log(file);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error reading directory:", err);
  }
}

main();
```

**Explanation:**

*   `listFilesRecursively(directory)`: The main function that initiates the recursive traversal.
*   `traverseDirectory(dir)`: A recursive helper function that reads the contents of a directory.
*   `fs.stat(itemPath)`: Checks if an item is a directory or a file.
*   `traverseDirectory(itemPath)`: If the item is a directory, the function calls itself recursively with the subdirectory path.
*   `files.push(itemPath)`: If the item is a file, it's added to the `files` array.
*   Error Handling: The `main` function includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the recursive directory traversal.

**Important Considerations for Recursive Listing:**

*   **Stack Overflow:**  Recursive functions can lead to stack overflow errors if the directory structure is very deep. Consider using an iterative approach for extremely deep directories.
*   **Performance:** Recursive directory traversal can be slow for large and complex directory structures. Optimize the function and consider using caching mechanisms if performance is a concern.
*   **Symbolic Links:** Be mindful of symbolic links, which can lead to infinite loops if not handled correctly. You might need to use `fs.lstat()` instead of `fs.stat()` to check if a file is a symbolic link.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Asynchronous Methods:**  Prefer asynchronous methods (`fs.readdir()`, `fs.promises.readdir()`) over synchronous methods (`fs.readdirSync()`) to avoid blocking the event loop.
*   **Handle Errors:**  Always handle potential errors during file system operations.
*   **Use `path.join()`:**  Use `path.join()` to construct file paths to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
*   **Optimize for Performance:** If performance is critical, consider using streaming APIs or caching mechanisms.
*   **Be Mindful of Recursive Depth:** Avoid excessive recursion to prevent stack overflow errors.
