# Assert Deep Equality in JavaScript Tests with `deepEqual` and `notDeepEqual`

Ensuring the correctness of your JavaScript code requires robust testing. A crucial part of that testing involves comparing expected and actual values. When dealing with primitive data types like numbers and strings, simple equality operators are sufficient. However, when working with complex objects and arrays, we need to use _deep equality_ checks. This blog post dives into the powerful `deepEqual` and `notDeepEqual` assertions, widely used in JavaScript testing frameworks like Chai, Mocha, Jest, and Node.js's built-in `assert` module, to accurately compare complex data structures.

## What is Deep Equality?

Unlike shallow equality (`===`), which only compares references to objects, deep equality compares the actual _content_ of objects and arrays recursively. This means it checks that corresponding properties or elements at each level are equal. This is crucial because two distinct objects or arrays can have the same structure and values, and we often want to assert that they are logically equivalent.

## `deepEqual` Assertion: The Core of Deep Comparison

The `deepEqual` assertion verifies that two objects or arrays are deeply equal. This means they must have the same structure, the same number of properties or elements, and their corresponding values must be equal (using deep equality recursively).

### Using `deepEqual` with Node.js `assert`

Node.js provides a built-in `assert` module for basic testing. Here's how to use `deepEqual` with it:

```plaintext
const assert = require('assert');

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj2 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj3 = { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } };

assert.deepStrictEqual(obj1, obj2, 'Objects should be deeply equal'); // Passes

assert.throws(() => {
  assert.deepStrictEqual(obj1, obj3, 'Objects should NOT be deeply equal'); // Fails
}, assert.AssertionError);

console.log('All assertions passed!');
```

**Explanation:**

- `require('assert')`: Imports the Node.js `assert` module.
- `assert.deepStrictEqual(obj1, obj2, 'Objects should be deeply equal')`: Asserts that `obj1` and `obj2` are deeply equal. The third argument is an optional message that will be displayed if the assertion fails. `deepStrictEqual` performs a stricter deep comparison, considering the data types of properties (e.g., `1` and `"1"` would not be considered equal). For less strict comparison (allowing type coercion), use `assert.deepEqual`.
- `assert.throws(...)`: This is used to assert that the next line of code throws an error. In this case, we expect an `AssertionError` because `obj1` and `obj3` are not deeply equal.
- `assert.AssertionError`: The expected error type when the assertion fails.
- `console.log('All assertions passed!')`: Prints a message if all assertions are successful.

**Key takeaway:** `assert.deepStrictEqual` checks for both deep equality and strict equality of primitive values. `assert.deepEqual` allows type coercion.

### Using `deepEqual` with Chai

Chai is a popular assertion library that provides a more expressive and readable syntax. Here's how to use `deep.equal` (or `deep.eql` which is an alias) with Chai:

```plaintext
const chai = require('chai');
const { expect } = chai;

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj2 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj3 = { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } };

expect(obj1).to.deep.equal(obj2); // Passes
expect(obj1).to.deep.eql(obj2);   // Passes (alias for deep.equal)

expect(obj1).to.not.deep.equal(obj3); // Passes

try {
    expect(obj1).to.deep.equal(obj3);
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message); // Outputs the assertion error message
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `require('chai')`: Imports the Chai library.
- `const { expect } = chai`: Destructures the `expect` function from Chai, which is the entry point for writing assertions.
- `expect(obj1).to.deep.equal(obj2)`: Asserts that `obj1` is deeply equal to `obj2`. Chai's chainable syntax makes assertions more readable.
- `expect(obj1).to.deep.eql(obj2)`: Demonstrates the use of `deep.eql`, which is an alias for `deep.equal`.
- `expect(obj1).to.not.deep.equal(obj3)`: Asserts that `obj1` is _not_ deeply equal to `obj3`. This uses `notDeepEqual` assertion which we will cover in the next section.
- `try...catch`: Demonstrates how to catch the error thrown by Chai when an assertion fails and log the error message.

**Key takeaway:** Chai provides a more fluent and readable syntax for writing assertions, making tests easier to understand and maintain.

### Using `deepEqual` with Jest

Jest is a popular testing framework, especially in React and JavaScript projects. It has built-in assertion capabilities. Here's how to use `toEqual` (which performs a deep equality check) with Jest:

```plaintext
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj2 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj3 = { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } };

test('objects are deeply equal', () => {
  expect(obj1).toEqual(obj2); // Passes
  expect(obj1).not.toEqual(obj3); // Passes
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `test('objects are deeply equal', () => { ... })`: Defines a test case in Jest.
- `expect(obj1).toEqual(obj2)`: Asserts that `obj1` is deeply equal to `obj2`. Jest's `toEqual` matcher performs a deep equality check, similar to Chai's `deep.equal`.
- `expect(obj1).not.toEqual(obj3)`: Asserts that `obj1` is _not_ deeply equal to `obj3`.

**Key takeaway:** Jest's `toEqual` matcher provides a convenient way to perform deep equality checks without needing external assertion libraries.

## `notDeepEqual` Assertion: Asserting Inequality

The `notDeepEqual` assertion (or its equivalent in various testing frameworks) verifies that two objects or arrays are _not_ deeply equal. This is the logical opposite of `deepEqual`.

### Using `notDeepEqual` with Node.js `assert`

```plaintext
const assert = require('assert');

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const obj3 = { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } };

assert.notDeepStrictEqual(obj1, obj3, 'Objects should NOT be deeply equal'); // Passes

assert.throws(() => {
  assert.notDeepStrictEqual(obj1, obj1, 'Objects should NOT be deeply equal'); // Fails, throws error
}, assert.AssertionError);

console.log('All assertions passed!');
```

### Using `notDeepEqual` with Chai

We already used `not.deep.equal` in the Chai example above. It's a direct negation of the `deep.equal` assertion.

### Using `notDeepEqual` with Jest

We also used `not.toEqual` in the Jest example above, demonstrating its straightforward usage.

## Best Practices for Using `deepEqual` and `notDeepEqual`

- **Use `deepEqual` for complex data structures:** When comparing objects or arrays, always use `deepEqual` (or its equivalent in your testing framework) to ensure that the content is being compared, not just references.
- **Choose the right assertion library:** Consider using a more expressive assertion library like Chai for better readability and maintainability.
- **Write clear assertion messages:** Provide informative messages to the `deepEqual` assertion to help diagnose failures quickly. The third argument in `assert.deepStrictEqual` and the error message handling in Chai demonstrates this.
- **Test edge cases:** Ensure you test various scenarios, including empty objects, nested objects, arrays of objects, and objects with different properties.
- **Understand the difference between strict and non-strict deep equality:** Be aware of the difference between `deepStrictEqual` and `deepEqual` in Node.js's `assert` module and choose the appropriate one based on whether you need to consider data type differences.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Confusing shallow and deep equality:** Using `===` to compare objects will only check if they are the _same object in memory_, not if they have the same content.
- **Ignoring the order of properties:** While most deep equality implementations don't consider the order of properties in objects, some might. Be aware of the specific behavior of your testing framework.
- **Forgetting to test negative cases:** Always include `notDeepEqual` assertions to verify that unequal objects are correctly identified.
- **Not considering circular references:** Deep equality implementations can have issues when dealing with circular references in objects (where an object references itself). Some frameworks might handle this, others might throw an error or get stuck in an infinite loop.

## Conclusion

`deepEqual` and `notDeepEqual` are essential tools for writing effective JavaScript tests, especially when dealing with complex data structures. By understanding how these assertions work and following best practices, you can create a robust and reliable test suite that catches subtle bugs and ensures the quality of your code. Choose the testing framework that best suits your project's needs, whether it's Node.js's built-in `assert` module, Chai's expressive syntax, or Jest's comprehensive features, and leverage `deepEqual` and `notDeepEqual` to compare the contents of objects and arrays accurately. Remember to consider type strictness, especially when using `assert`, and to always test both positive and negative cases for complete coverage. Happy testing!
