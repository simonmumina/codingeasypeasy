# Mastering `align-content` in CSS Grid: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that gives you fine-grained control over the placement and alignment of elements on a webpage. While properties like `align-items` and `justify-content` are crucial for aligning individual grid items, `align-content` plays a pivotal role in aligning the *grid tracks* themselves within the grid container.  This guide dives deep into the `align-content` property, providing you with practical examples and explanations to master vertical alignment within your CSS Grid layouts.

## What is `align-content`?

The `align-content` property in CSS Grid controls the alignment of grid tracks along the block (column) axis of the grid container.  This means it determines how the space is distributed between and around the grid tracks when the total size of the grid tracks is less than the size of the grid container. In simpler terms, it handles vertical alignment of your grid rows.

**Important Note:** `align-content` only has an effect when the total size of the grid tracks is smaller than the grid container's height. If the grid tracks completely fill the container, there's no extra space to distribute, and `align-content` won't be visible.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for `align-content` is:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  /* ... other grid properties ... */
  align-content: <value>;
}
```

Where `<value>` can be one of the following:

*   `start`: Packs the grid tracks together at the start edge of the grid container along the block axis.
*   `end`: Packs the grid tracks together at the end edge of the grid container along the block axis.
*   `center`: Packs the grid tracks together in the center of the grid container along the block axis.
*   `stretch`:  Resizes the grid tracks to fill the available space in the grid container along the block axis.  This is the default behavior if `height` is auto.
*   `space-around`: Distributes the space evenly between and around the grid tracks. The first and last grid track will each have half the space of the tracks in between them.
*   `space-between`: Distributes the space evenly between grid tracks. The first grid track is flush with the start edge, and the last grid track is flush with the end edge.
*   `space-evenly`: Distributes the space evenly between, around, and before grid tracks. This ensures equal spacing around each track.
*   `normal`:  Behaves as `stretch` if the grid items have a definite size along the cross axis; otherwise, behaves as `start`. This is the initial value.

## Practical Examples with Code

Let's illustrate the usage of `align-content` with several examples. We'll use a simple grid with three rows and two columns.

**HTML (index.html):**

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">6</div>
</div>
```

**CSS (styles.css):**

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* 2 columns, equal width */
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px); /* 3 rows, each 100px high */
  height: 400px; /* Important: Set a container height larger than the combined row heights (300px) to see align-content in action */
  border: 2px solid black;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #eee;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Now, let's apply different `align-content` values to see how they affect the grid layout.

### 1. `align-content: start;`

```css
.grid-container {
  /* ... previous styles ... */
  align-content: start;
}
```

This aligns the grid tracks to the top of the container. The available space is located at the bottom.

### 2. `align-content: end;`

```css
.grid-container {
  /* ... previous styles ... */
  align-content: end;
}
```

This aligns the grid tracks to the bottom of the container. The available space is located at the top.

### 3. `align-content: center;`

```css
.grid-container {
  /* ... previous styles ... */
  align-content: center;
}
```

This centers the grid tracks vertically within the container.  Equal space is distributed above and below the tracks.

### 4. `align-content: stretch;`

```css
.grid-container {
  /* ... previous styles ... */
  align-content: stretch;
}
```

This stretches the grid tracks to fill the available space in the container.  Each row will now have a height greater than 100px to fill the 400px container.

### 5. `align-content: space-around;`

```css
.grid-container {
  /* ... previous styles ... */
  align-content: space-around;
}
```

This distributes space evenly *around* the grid tracks. The space before the first track and after the last track will be half the size of the space between the tracks.

### 6. `align-content: space-between;`

```css
.grid-container {
  /* ... previous styles ... */
  align-content: space-between;
}
```

This distributes space evenly *between* the grid tracks. The first track aligns with the top edge, and the last track aligns with the bottom edge.

### 7. `align-content: space-evenly;`

```css
.grid-container {
  /* ... previous styles ... */
  align-content: space-evenly;
}
```

This distributes space evenly between, around, and before the grid tracks.  The space above the first row, between the rows, and below the last row will all be equal.

## `align-content` vs. `align-items`

It's important to differentiate between `align-content` and `align-items`:

*   **`align-content`**:  Controls the alignment of the *grid tracks* (rows or columns) themselves within the grid container. It works when the total size of the tracks is less than the size of the grid container. It affects the entire row.

*   **`align-items`**: Controls the alignment of *individual grid items* within their respective grid areas along the block (column) axis. It affects each item individually.

Think of it this way: `align-content` is for aligning the container rows, while `align-items` is for aligning the items *inside* each row.

## Combining `align-content` with Other Grid Properties

`align-content` often works in conjunction with other CSS Grid properties to create complex and responsive layouts. Here's an example that combines `align-content`, `justify-content`, and `place-items`:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
  height: 400px;
  align-content: center; /* Center tracks vertically */
  justify-content: center; /* Center tracks horizontally (similar to align-items on the inline axis) */
  place-items: center; /* Center individual items within their grid areas both vertically and horizontally (shorthand for align-items and justify-items) */
  border: 2px solid black;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #eee;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

In this example, the grid tracks are centered both horizontally and vertically within the container, and each individual grid item is centered within its assigned grid cell.

## Browser Compatibility

`align-content` is well-supported across modern browsers.  You can check the latest browser support information on [Can I use...](https://caniuse.com/align-content).

## Common Use Cases

*   **Vertical Centering:**  Centering content vertically, especially when the content's height is dynamic.
*   **Distributing Space:**  Creating layouts where content is evenly distributed within a container.
*   **Flexible Headers and Footers:**  Pinning headers and footers to the top and bottom of a container, respectively.
*   **Responsive Design:**  Adapting layouts to different screen sizes by adjusting the alignment of grid tracks.

## Conclusion

The `align-content` property is an essential tool for mastering vertical alignment in CSS Grid layouts. By understanding its behavior and how it interacts with other grid properties, you can create sophisticated and responsive designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and content variations. Experiment with the examples provided in this guide, and you'll be well on your way to mastering the art of vertical alignment with CSS Grid! Remember to set a `height` on the grid container and ensure that the total height of the grid tracks is less than the container's height for `align-content` to have a visible effect.
