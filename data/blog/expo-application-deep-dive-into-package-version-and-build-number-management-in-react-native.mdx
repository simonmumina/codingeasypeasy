# Expo Application: Deep Dive into Package, Version, and Build Number Management in React Native

Managing application metadata such as package names (Bundle Identifier/Application ID), version numbers, and build numbers is crucial for successful app deployment and maintenance in React Native. Expo provides a convenient and robust solution through the `expo-application` library. This guide will explore the ins and outs of `expo-application`, empowering you to access and utilize this vital information within your React Native apps built with Expo.

## What is Expo Application?

`expo-application` is an Expo SDK library that exposes information about your application, including its package name (Bundle Identifier for iOS, Application ID for Android), version number, build number, and more. It allows you to access these values programmatically within your React Native code. This is incredibly useful for:

- **Debugging and Logging:** Easily include version and build information in your logs to help diagnose issues reported by users.
- **Feature Flags:** Implement different features based on the application version.
- **Remote Configuration:** Fetch configuration tailored to a specific build version.
- **Analytics:** Track usage patterns across different application versions.
- **Conditional Updates:** Show different update messages depending on the installed version.

## Installation

To install `expo-application`, use the following command within your Expo project:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-application
```

This command will automatically install the package and add the necessary configurations to your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.

## Usage

After installation, you can import and use the `expo-application` library in your React Native components or utilities. Here's how to retrieve various application details:

### 1. Retrieving the Application ID (Package Name)

The Application ID (Android) or Bundle Identifier (iOS) uniquely identifies your application in the respective app stores. It's configured within your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file. Here's how to access it:

```plaintext
import * as Application from 'expo-application'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [applicationId, setApplicationId] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getApplicationId() {
      const appId = await Application.getApplicationIdAsync()
      setApplicationId(appId)
    }

    getApplicationId()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Application ID: {applicationId}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `Application` module from `expo-application`.
- `Application.getApplicationIdAsync()` is an asynchronous function that retrieves the Application ID (Android) or Bundle Identifier (iOS) as configured in your `app.json` file.
- The result is stored in the `applicationId` state variable and displayed in the `Text` component.

### 2. Retrieving the Application Version

The application version represents the user-facing version of your app. This is typically a semantic version string (e.g., "1.2.3"). You configure this in your `app.json` file:

```plaintext
import * as Application from 'expo-application'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [version, setVersion] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getVersion() {
      const appVersion = Application.nativeApplicationVersion
      setVersion(appVersion)
    }

    getVersion()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Version: {version}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `Application` module from `expo-application`.
- `Application.nativeApplicationVersion` provides direct access to the version string. Note that it is not an asynchronous call in this case.
- The result is stored in the `version` state variable and displayed in the `Text` component.

### 3. Retrieving the Native Application Build Number

The build number (also called version code on Android, and build number on iOS) is an integer that increments with each build. It's used internally to differentiate builds and ensure that users receive updates correctly.

```plaintext
import * as Application from 'expo-application'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [buildNumber, setBuildNumber] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getBuildNumber() {
      const appBuildNumber = Application.nativeBuildVersion
      setBuildNumber(appBuildNumber)
    }

    getBuildNumber()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Build Number: {buildNumber}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `Application` module from `expo-application`.
- `Application.nativeBuildVersion` provides direct access to the build number as a string. Note that it is not an asynchronous call in this case.
- The result is stored in the `buildNumber` state variable and displayed in the `Text` component.

### 4. Accessing the `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) Directly

While `expo-application` primarily provides access to native build properties, you can also access the raw values defined in your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file directly. This is useful for retrieving other configuration settings that you might need in your application. The best way to do this is using the `useAppContext` hook in Expo SDK 49+. For older SDK versions you would use `Constants.manifest`.

```plaintext
import { useExpo } from 'expo-router'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const { manifest } = useExpo()

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Display Name: {manifest?.name}</Text>
      <Text>Version: {manifest?.version}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous:** Note that `getApplicationIdAsync` is asynchronous and requires using `await`, while `nativeApplicationVersion` and `nativeBuildVersion` are synchronous. Choose the appropriate approach based on the specific property you need to access. Using asynchronous calls avoids blocking the main thread.
- **`app.json` Configuration:** Ensure that your `app.json` file is correctly configured with the desired values for `version`, `android.versionCode`, and `ios.buildNumber`. These values are essential for `expo-application` to function correctly. Example:

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.myapp",
      "versionCode": 4
    },
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp",
      "buildNumber": "1.2.3.4"
    }
  }
}
```

- **Development vs. Production:** In development, the values returned by `expo-application` might not always reflect the final build values. Always test your app thoroughly in production builds to ensure the values are accurate. Expo Go will not reflect the final values.
- **Platform Specificity:** While `getApplicationIdAsync` works consistently across iOS and Android, you should be mindful that the property names for version codes and build numbers differ between the platforms (`versionCode` vs. `buildNumber`). Use conditional logic if you need to handle these discrepancies. For instance:

```plaintext
import * as Application from 'expo-application'
import { Platform } from 'react-native'

async function getBuildDetails() {
  const version = Application.nativeApplicationVersion
  const buildNumber = Application.nativeBuildVersion

  console.log(`Version: ${version}`)
  console.log(`Build Number: ${buildNumber}`)
}
```

- **Using with EAS Build:** When using EAS Build, the build number is automatically incremented. Ensure that your build configuration handles this correctly. You don't typically need to manage the build number manually when using EAS Build, as it's handled by the system.

## Practical Examples

Here are a few practical examples of how you can use `expo-application` in your React Native apps:

**1. Displaying App Info in a Settings Screen:**

Create a simple settings screen that displays the application name, version, and build number:

```plaintext
import * as Application from 'expo-application'
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { useExpo } from 'expo-router'

export default function SettingsScreen() {
  const { manifest } = useExpo()

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.header}>Application Information</Text>
      <Text>Name: {manifest?.name}</Text>
      <Text>Version: {manifest?.version}</Text>
      <Text>Build Number: {Application.nativeBuildVersion}</Text>
      <Text>Application ID: {manifest?.slug}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  header: {
    fontSize: 20,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
})
```

**2. Logging Version Information to a Remote Service:**

Include version information in your logs when reporting errors or tracking usage patterns:

```plaintext
import * as Application from 'expo-application'

function logEvent(eventName, data = {}) {
  const logData = {
    ...data,
    appVersion: Application.nativeApplicationVersion,
    appBuildNumber: Application.nativeBuildVersion,
    applicationId: Application.getApplicationIdAsync(), // Remember to handle the promise
  }

  console.log(eventName, logData)
  // Replace console.log with your actual logging mechanism
}

// Example Usage
logEvent('user_login', { userId: 123 })
```

**3. Conditional Feature Rollout Based on Version:**

Enable or disable features based on the application version:

```plaintext
import * as Application from 'expo-application'

function isFeatureEnabled(featureName) {
  const version = Application.nativeApplicationVersion
  const versionParts = version.split('.').map(Number)

  if (featureName === 'new_ui' && versionParts[0] >= 2) {
    return true // Enable the new UI for version 2.0.0 and above
  }

  return false
}

// Example Usage
if (isFeatureEnabled('new_ui')) {
  // Render the new UI
} else {
  // Render the old UI
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Values Not Updating:** Ensure that you are rebuilding your app after making changes to your `app.json` file. Incremental builds may not always reflect the changes immediately. Clean your build cache if needed.
- **Error: "Application.getApplicationIdAsync is not a function"**: Double-check that you have correctly installed `expo-application` and that your Expo SDK version is compatible. If you recently upgraded Expo, try clearing your npm cache and reinstalling the dependencies.
- **Incorrect Values in Expo Go:** Remember that the values in Expo Go can differ from the final built app. Always test on a real device or simulator with a build created using `expo build` or `eas build`.

## Conclusion

`expo-application` is an essential tool for managing application metadata in your React Native projects built with Expo. By leveraging this library, you can access and utilize valuable information like package names, version numbers, and build numbers to enhance debugging, implement feature flags, and improve the overall user experience. Remember to configure your `app.json` file correctly, handle asynchronous calls appropriately, and test your app thoroughly in production builds to ensure accurate results. With this guide, you are well-equipped to harness the power of `expo-application` in your React Native development workflow.
