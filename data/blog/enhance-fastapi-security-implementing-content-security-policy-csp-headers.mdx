# Enhance FastAPI Security: Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers

Securing your web applications is paramount, and FastAPI provides excellent tools to help you achieve this. One crucial security measure is implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. This comprehensive guide will walk you through understanding CSP and how to integrate it effectively with your FastAPI applications.

## What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP is essentially a whitelist that tells the browser which sources of content are allowed to be loaded. Anything not on the whitelist is blocked.

Think of CSP as a set of rules that you define in your server's response headers. These rules instruct the browser on which domains and resources are permitted to load scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, and other assets. By strictly defining these policies, you dramatically reduce the attack surface of your application.

## Why Use CSP with FastAPI?

FastAPI provides a straightforward and efficient way to build APIs. However, like any web application framework, it's your responsibility to ensure the security of your application. Implementing CSP adds a significant layer of defense against common web vulnerabilities:

- **Mitigation of XSS Attacks:** By limiting the sources from which the browser can load scripts, CSP effectively prevents malicious scripts injected into your application from running.
- **Data Injection Prevention:** CSP can restrict the loading of external data sources, helping to prevent data injection attacks.
- **URL Whitelisting:** CSP allows you to explicitly define which domains and sources are trusted, preventing the browser from loading resources from untrusted sources.
- **Compliance and Best Practices:** Implementing CSP demonstrates a commitment to security best practices and can help your application comply with security standards and regulations.

## Implementing CSP in FastAPI

Here's how to implement CSP headers in your FastAPI application:

**1. Install FastAPI (if you haven't already):**

```plaintext
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

**2. Basic FastAPI Application:**

Create a basic `main.py` file:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

**3. Adding CSP Headers Using Middleware:**

The most common and recommended way to implement CSP in FastAPI is by using middleware. This allows you to apply the headers to all responses (or selectively to specific routes).

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response, Request
from fastapi.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware, RequestResponseEndpoint


class CSPMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(
        self, request: Request, call_next: RequestResponseEndpoint
    ) -> Response:
        response = await call_next(request)
        csp_header = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://example.com; style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;"
        response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = csp_header
        return response


app = FastAPI(middleware=[Middleware(CSPMiddleware)])


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`CSPMiddleware`:** This class extends `BaseHTTPMiddleware` and intercepts every request. It then calls the next middleware in the chain (or the route handler) and adds the `Content-Security-Policy` header to the response.
- **`dispatch` method:** This is where the magic happens. The `dispatch` method is called for each request. It receives the `request` and the `call_next` function, which is used to call the next middleware or the route handler.
- **`csp_header` variable:** This holds the actual CSP policy. Let's break down this example:
  - `default-src 'self';`: This sets the default policy for all resource types. `'self'` means that resources from the same origin (domain, protocol, and port) are allowed.
  - `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://example.com;`: This specifies which sources are allowed for scripts. `'self'` allows scripts from the same origin. `'unsafe-inline'` allows inline scripts (scripts within HTML tags, generally discouraged for security). `https://example.com` allows scripts from that specific domain. Be careful with `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`, as they significantly weaken the protection offered by CSP.
  - `style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com;`: This defines allowed sources for stylesheets. It allows stylesheets from the same origin and from Google Fonts.
  - `img-src 'self' data:;`: This defines allowed sources for images. It allows images from the same origin and `data:` URIs (inline images encoded in base64).
  - `font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;`: This defines allowed sources for fonts. It allows fonts from the same origin and from Google Fonts' static content server.
- **`app = FastAPI(middleware=[Middleware(CSPMiddleware)])`:** This registers the `CSPMiddleware` with your FastAPI application.

**4. Running the Application:**

Save the code as `main.py` and run the application using:

```plaintext
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Now, when you access the root route in your browser, inspect the response headers. You should see the `Content-Security-Policy` header with the value you defined in the middleware.

**5. Customizing CSP for Specific Routes:**

You can tailor the CSP for specific routes using dependencies:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response, Request, Depends

app = FastAPI()

def get_csp_header(route_csp: str):
  async def csp_dependency():
    return {"Content-Security-Policy": route_csp}
  return csp_dependency


@app.get("/", dependencies=[Depends(get_csp_header("default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';"))])
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/unsafe", dependencies=[Depends(get_csp_header("default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"))])
async def read_unsafe():
    return {"Hello": "World - Unsafe Example"}

```

**Explanation:**

- **`get_csp_header(route_csp: str)`:** This is a function that creates a dependency. It takes the CSP string as an argument.
- **`csp_dependency()`:** This async function returns a dictionary containing the `Content-Security-Policy` header and the provided `route_csp`.
- **`@app.get("/", dependencies=[Depends(get_csp_header(...))]`:** This applies the CSP header to the `/` route using the `Depends` parameter and the `get_csp_header` function. Now the root route uses a more restrictive CSP.
- **`@app.get("/unsafe", dependencies=[Depends(get_csp_header(...))]`:** This applies a different CSP header (allowing `'unsafe-inline'`) to the `/unsafe` route. This is purely for demonstration and should be avoided in production unless absolutely necessary.

**6. CSP Report-Only Mode:**

CSP also offers a "report-only" mode, which allows you to monitor the effect of your policy without actually enforcing it. This is invaluable for testing and debugging. To enable report-only mode, use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response, Request
from fastapi.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware, RequestResponseEndpoint


class CSPMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(
        self, request: Request, call_next: RequestResponseEndpoint
    ) -> Response:
        response = await call_next(request)
        csp_header = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://example.com; style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;"
        response.headers["Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only"] = csp_header
        return response


app = FastAPI(middleware=[Middleware(CSPMiddleware)])


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

In this mode, the browser will report violations of the policy to a specified URL (using the `report-uri` directive â€“ discussed later), but it won't block the resources.

**7. Common CSP Directives:**

Here's a breakdown of some essential CSP directives:

- **`default-src`:** Sets the default policy for fetching resources. If a specific directive (like `script-src` or `img-src`) isn't defined, `default-src` is used as a fallback.
- **`script-src`:** Defines allowed sources for JavaScript. This is one of the most critical directives.
- **`style-src`:** Defines allowed sources for CSS stylesheets.
- **`img-src`:** Defines allowed sources for images.
- **`font-src`:** Defines allowed sources for fonts.
- **`media-src`:** Defines allowed sources for `<audio>`, `<video>`, and `<track>` elements.
- **`object-src`:** Defines allowed sources for `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements (often used for Flash, which should be avoided).
- **`frame-src`:** Defines allowed sources for `<frame>` and `<iframe>` elements.
- **`connect-src`:** Defines allowed origins for `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, and EventSource connections.
- **`manifest-src`:** Defines allowed sources for application manifest files.
- **`base-uri`:** Restricts the URLs that can be used in a document's `<base>` element.
- **`form-action`:** Restricts the URLs to which forms can be submitted.
- **`frame-ancestors`:** Specifies valid parents that may embed a page using `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>`. (This is similar to `X-Frame-Options`, but more powerful.)
- **`upgrade-insecure-requests`:** Instructs browsers to automatically upgrade all HTTP URLs to HTTPS.
- **`block-all-mixed-content`:** Prevents the loading of any resources over HTTP when the page is loaded over HTTPS.
- **`report-uri`:** Specifies a URL to which the browser should send violation reports. This is essential for monitoring CSP effectiveness. **Deprecated in favor of `report-to`.**
- **`report-to`:** Specifies a named endpoint (defined in the `Report-To` header) to which the browser should send violation reports. This is the modern replacement for `report-uri`.
- **`worker-src`**: Specifies valid sources for Worker, SharedWorker, or ServiceWorker scripts.

**8. Using `report-to` for Violation Reporting:**

To use `report-to`, you need to define a reporting group using the `Report-To` header _alongside_ the `Content-Security-Policy` (or `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) header.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response, Request
from fastapi.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware, RequestResponseEndpoint
import json

class CSPMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(
        self, request: Request, call_next: RequestResponseEndpoint
    ) -> Response:
        response = await call_next(request)
        csp_header = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; report-to csp-endpoint;"
        report_to_header = json.dumps({
            "group": "csp-endpoint",
            "max_age": 31536000,  # One year
            "endpoints": [
                {
                    "url": "/csp-report"  # Your endpoint to receive reports
                }
            ]
        })
        response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = csp_header
        response.headers["Report-To"] = report_to_header
        return response


app = FastAPI(middleware=[Middleware(CSPMiddleware)])

@app.post("/csp-report")
async def csp_report(report: dict):
    # Process the CSP report here (e.g., log it to a file or database)
    print("CSP Report:", report)
    return {"status": "received"}


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`report_to_header`:** This is a JSON string that defines the reporting group.
  - `group`: A name for the reporting group (e.g., "csp-endpoint").
  - `max_age`: The time (in seconds) for which the reporting group is valid.
  - `endpoints`: An array of endpoints where reports should be sent. Each endpoint has a `url`. **Crucially, this URL must be an absolute path on your server (e.g., `/csp-report`).**
- **`csp_header`**: Note the `report-to csp-endpoint;` part. This tells the browser to send reports to the endpoint defined by the "csp-endpoint" group.
- **`@app.post("/csp-report")`:** This defines a route (`/csp-report`) to handle incoming CSP reports. You should process these reports to identify and address potential security issues. Consider logging them to a file, sending them to a monitoring service, or even alerting you when specific types of violations occur.

**9. Example Policies:**

Here are some more examples of CSP policies:

- **Strict Policy (allowing only same-origin resources):**

  ```
  default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
  ```

  This policy allows only resources from the same origin and disables inline scripts and styles. This is a good starting point, but it might require adjustments based on your application's needs.

- **Allowing Google Analytics:**

  ```
  default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com https://www.googletagmanager.com; connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com; img-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com https://www.gstatic.com; style-src 'self';
  ```

- **Allowing CDNs for Scripts and Styles:**

  ```
  default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com; style-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;
  ```

**10. Testing and Debugging CSP:**

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Most modern browsers have excellent CSP support in their developer tools. You can see which resources are being blocked and why. Look for CSP violation reports in the console.
- **CSP Validators:** Use online CSP validators to check your policy for syntax errors and potential weaknesses.
- **Start with `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`:** Begin by deploying your CSP in report-only mode to gather data about violations without breaking your application.
- **Incrementally Add Directives:** Don't try to create a perfect CSP policy all at once. Start with a basic policy and gradually add more directives as needed.

**11. Best Practices:**

- **Start Simple, Iterate Often:** Begin with a restrictive policy and gradually loosen it as needed. Monitor violations and adjust your policy accordingly.
- **Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`:** These directives significantly weaken the protection offered by CSP. Use them only as a last resort and with extreme caution.
- **Use Nonces or Hashes for Inline Scripts and Styles:** If you must use inline scripts or styles, consider using nonces or hashes to whitelist specific blocks of code. This is a more secure alternative to `'unsafe-inline'`.
- **Regularly Review and Update Your Policy:** As your application evolves, your CSP policy needs to be updated to reflect the new requirements.
- **Monitor CSP Reports:** Set up a system for monitoring CSP violation reports. This will help you identify and address potential security issues.
- **Consider Using a CSP Generator:** Several online tools can help you generate CSP policies based on your application's requirements. These can be a good starting point, but always review and customize the generated policy.
- **Educate Your Team:** Make sure your developers understand the importance of CSP and how to implement it correctly.

## Conclusion

Implementing Content Security Policy is a crucial step in securing your FastAPI applications. By carefully defining the sources of content that are allowed to load, you can significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks and other web vulnerabilities. Remember to start simple, iterate often, and monitor your CSP reports to ensure that your policy is effective and doesn't break your application. By following these guidelines, you can build more secure and resilient web applications with FastAPI.
