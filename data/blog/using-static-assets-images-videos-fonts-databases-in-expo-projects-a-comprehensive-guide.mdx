# Using Static Assets (Images, Videos, Fonts, Databases) in Expo Projects: A Comprehensive Guide

Building rich and engaging mobile applications with Expo React Native often requires incorporating static assets. These can include everything from images and videos that enhance the visual appeal of your app to fonts that define its typography and even local database files for offline data persistence. Properly managing these assets is crucial for performance, user experience, and maintainability. This guide will walk you through the best practices for using static assets in your Expo projects, covering images, videos, fonts, and database files.

## Why Are Static Assets Important?

Static assets are the building blocks of your app's user interface and functionality.  They contribute significantly to:

*   **Visual Appeal:**  Images, videos, and custom fonts make your app visually appealing and help establish brand identity.
*   **User Experience:**  Well-optimized assets contribute to a smooth and responsive user experience by reducing loading times.
*   **Functionality:** Local database files enable offline access to data and enhance the app's capabilities.
*   **Reduced Network Requests:** Embedding assets directly within your app package eliminates the need to fetch them from a server, improving performance, especially in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.

## 1. Organizing Your Assets

Before diving into the code, let's discuss asset organization.  A well-structured asset directory improves maintainability and makes it easier to locate and manage your files. A recommended structure is:

```
my-expo-project/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── logo.png
│   │   ├── background.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── videos/
│   │   ├── intro.mp4
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── fonts/
│   │   ├── OpenSans-Regular.ttf
│   │   ├── OpenSans-Bold.ttf
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── data.db
│   │   └── ...
├── App.js
├── ...
```

This structure separates different types of assets into dedicated folders, making it clear where to find specific resources. You can further organize images by screen, feature, or any other logical grouping that suits your project.

## 2. Handling Images

Images are the most common type of static asset used in mobile apps. Expo provides several ways to manage and display images:

### a. Local Images (Bundled with the App)

The most straightforward way to use images is by placing them within your project's asset directory and referencing them using relative paths. Expo's Metro bundler will automatically include these images in your app's bundle.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Image, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  logo: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    resizeMode: 'contain', // Adjust resizeMode as needed
  },
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image source={require('./assets/images/logo.png')} style={styles.logo} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `require('./assets/images/logo.png')` tells Metro bundler to bundle the `logo.png` image into the app.
*   The `Image` component displays the image.
*   `resizeMode` controls how the image is scaled to fit within its container. Common options include `contain`, `cover`, `stretch`, and `center`.

**Best Practices for Images:**

*   **Optimize Image Size:**  Use image optimization tools (e.g., TinyPNG, ImageOptim) to reduce file size without significantly compromising quality.  Smaller images load faster and reduce the app's overall size.
*   **Choose the Right Format:**  Use `.png` for images with transparency and `.jpg` or `.jpeg` for photographs.  `.webp` offers superior compression and quality compared to `.jpg`, but browser/platform support should be checked.
*   **Provide Different Resolutions:**  For different screen densities, consider providing images with different resolutions (e.g., `@2x`, `@3x` suffixes).  Expo will automatically select the appropriate image based on the device's screen density. For example, you could have `logo.png`, `logo@2x.png`, and `logo@3x.png`.
*   **Use Caching:**  Expo and React Native automatically handle some image caching.  However, you can implement more sophisticated caching strategies using libraries like `react-native-fast-image` for improved performance.
*   **Consider using SVGs:** For simple icons and vector graphics, use SVGs with libraries like `react-native-svg`.  SVGs are resolution-independent and typically smaller than raster images.

### b. Remote Images (Fetched from a URL)

You can also display images hosted on a remote server using a URL.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Image, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  remoteImage: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  },
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image
        source={{ uri: 'https://via.placeholder.com/200' }}
        style={styles.remoteImage}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Considerations for Remote Images:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** Ensure the user has a stable internet connection.  Handle potential network errors gracefully.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to avoid repeatedly downloading the same image. Libraries like `react-native-fast-image` can significantly improve caching performance.
*   **Image Optimization:** Optimize images on the server-side to reduce download times.
*   **Security:** Use HTTPS to ensure secure image delivery.

## 3. Embedding Videos

Adding video to your Expo app can enhance user engagement. You can embed videos from local files or stream them from remote URLs.

**Using `expo-av`:**

Expo provides the `expo-av` package for handling audio and video playback. First, install it:

```bash
npx expo install expo-av
```

**Example (Local Video):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { Video } from 'expo-av';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  video: {
    width: 300,
    height: 200,
  },
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Video
        source={require('./assets/videos/intro.mp4')}
        style={styles.video}
        useNativeControls
        resizeMode="contain"
        isLooping
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Example (Remote Video):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { Video } from 'expo-av';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  video: {
    width: 300,
    height: 200,
  },
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Video
        source={{ uri: 'http://d23dyxeqlo5psv.cloudfront.net/big_buck_bunny.mp4' }}
        style={styles.video}
        useNativeControls
        resizeMode="contain"
        isLooping
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Video` component from `expo-av` is used to play the video.
*   `source` prop specifies the video source (either a local file or a remote URL).
*   `useNativeControls` adds native playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.).
*   `resizeMode` controls how the video is scaled to fit within its container.
*   `isLooping` makes the video loop continuously.

**Video Optimization Tips:**

*   **Compress Videos:** Use video compression tools to reduce file size.
*   **Choose the Right Format:** MP4 is generally a good choice for video compatibility.
*   **Streaming:**  For large videos, consider using streaming services to avoid large initial downloads.
*   **Progress Indicator:** Display a loading indicator while the video is buffering.

## 4. Using Custom Fonts

Custom fonts can significantly enhance your app's branding and visual appeal. Expo simplifies the process of loading and using custom fonts.

**a. Install `expo-font`:**

```bash
npx expo install expo-font @expo/vector-icons
```

**b. Load Fonts Asynchronously:**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as Font from 'expo-font';
import { AppLoading } from 'expo';
import { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons';

const fetchFonts = () => {
  return Font.loadAsync({
    'open-sans-regular': require('./assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf'),
    'open-sans-bold': require('./assets/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf'),
    ...Ionicons.font, // Load Ionicons as well
  });
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  textRegular: {
    fontFamily: 'open-sans-regular',
    fontSize: 16,
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  textBold: {
    fontFamily: 'open-sans-bold',
    fontSize: 16,
  },
});

export default function App() {
  const [fontLoaded, setFontLoaded] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadResourcesAsync = async () => {
      try {
        // Load fonts here
        await fetchFonts();
      } catch (e) {
        // We might want to provide this error information to an error reporting service
        console.warn(e);
      } finally {
        setFontLoaded(true);
      }
    };

    loadResourcesAsync();
  }, []);


  if (!fontLoaded) {
    return <AppLoading />;
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.textRegular}>This text uses Open Sans Regular.</Text>
      <Text style={styles.textBold}>This text uses Open Sans Bold.</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Font.loadAsync` loads the fonts asynchronously.  The keys in the object (e.g., `'open-sans-regular'`) are the font family names you'll use in your styles.
*   `AppLoading` (deprecated in newer Expo versions, consider a custom loading screen component)  prevents the app from rendering until the fonts are loaded. A simple loading indicator could be used instead.
*   In your `StyleSheet`, use the `fontFamily` property to specify the font.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Font Files:**  Ensure your font files are in `.ttf` or `.otf` format.
*   **Font Naming:** Choose descriptive font family names to avoid conflicts.
*   **Performance:** Only load the fonts you need to minimize the app's size.
*   **Using Ionicons or other Icon sets**:  Libraries like `expo/vector-icons`  allow the easy use of icon fonts, simplifying the addition of icons to your app. Remember to load their fonts too (e.g., `...Ionicons.font`).

## 5. Working with Database Files (SQLite)

For offline data storage, you can use SQLite databases.  You can either create an empty database within your app or bundle a pre-populated database as a static asset.

**a. Install `expo-sqlite`:**

```bash
npx expo install expo-sqlite
```

**b. Accessing the Database:**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SQLite from 'expo-sqlite';

const db = SQLite.openDatabase('myDatabase.db'); // Or 'database/myDatabase.db' if placed in a subfolder

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    db.transaction(tx => {
      tx.executeSql(
        'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, value INTEGER);'
      );
      tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM items', [], (_, { rows }) =>
        setData(rows._array)
      );
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {data.map(item => (
        <Text key={item.id}>{item.name}: {item.value}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `SQLite.openDatabase('myDatabase.db')` opens (or creates if it doesn't exist) the database.  If you place the pre-populated database file in the `assets/database` folder, you can reference it as `'database/myDatabase.db'`. Metro bundler will copy your pre-populated database to the appropriate location during the build process.
*   `db.transaction` executes SQL queries within a transaction.
*   `tx.executeSql` executes a single SQL query.
*   The example creates a table if it doesn't exist and then fetches data from the `items` table.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Pre-populated Databases:** To bundle a pre-populated database, place the `.db` file in your `assets/database` directory (or similar). When you run your app, Expo will copy the database file to the correct location within the app's file system.
*   **Data Persistence:** SQLite databases provide persistent data storage, meaning data will remain available even after the app is closed.
*   **Database Management:** Use a SQLite browser (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite) to create, populate, and manage your database files.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch potential database errors.

## 6. Asset Loading and Management with `expo-asset`

The `expo-asset` package provides a more robust way to manage and download assets, especially when dealing with large files or assets that need to be updated independently of the app's code.

**a. Install `expo-asset`:**

```bash
npx expo install expo-asset
```

**b. Usage:**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Image, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { Asset } from 'expo-asset';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  image: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  },
});

export default function App() {
  const [asset, setAsset] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadAsset = async () => {
      const imageAsset = await Asset.loadAsync(require('./assets/images/logo.png'));
      setAsset(imageAsset[0]); // loadAsync returns an array.
    };

    loadAsset();
  }, []);

  if (!asset) {
    return <View><Text>Loading...</Text></View>; // Replace with a better loading component
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image source={asset} style={styles.image} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Asset.loadAsync` loads the asset. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of `Asset` objects. The first element of the array represents the loaded asset.
*  The `source` prop of the `<Image>` component is directly assigned the `asset` object. This allows Expo to efficiently manage the image.
*   `expo-asset` manages caching and versioning of assets, simplifying updates.

**Benefits of using `expo-asset`:**

*   **Caching:** Provides built-in caching mechanisms.
*   **Versioning:** Supports asset versioning for seamless updates.
*   **Remote Asset Management:** Can be used to download assets from remote URLs at runtime.
*   **Metadata:** Provides access to asset metadata (e.g., width, height, type).

## 7. Optimizing Asset Loading

Loading assets efficiently is crucial for a smooth user experience. Here are some techniques to optimize asset loading:

*   **Asynchronous Loading:** Load assets asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI thread. Use `useEffect` hooks and promises to manage asynchronous loading.  Examples above all use this method.
*   **Loading Indicators:** Display loading indicators (e.g., spinners, progress bars) while assets are loading to provide feedback to the user.
*   **Pre-loading:** Pre-load assets that are likely to be used soon to reduce loading times when they are needed.  This could be during the initial app load, or when a user navigates to a new screen.
*   **Code Splitting:**  Split your app into smaller chunks to reduce the initial download size. Expo handles code splitting automatically.
*   **Lazy Loading:**  Only load assets when they are needed.  For example, load images when they become visible on the screen.

## Conclusion

Effectively managing static assets is essential for building high-quality Expo React Native applications. By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can optimize your app's performance, enhance the user experience, and improve the overall maintainability of your codebase. Remember to prioritize asset optimization, use asynchronous loading, and choose the right tools for managing your assets.  With a well-planned asset strategy, your Expo app will be more responsive, visually appealing, and engaging for your users.
