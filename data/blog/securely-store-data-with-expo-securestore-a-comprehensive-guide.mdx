# Securely Store Data with Expo SecureStore: A Comprehensive Guide

Protecting sensitive data in mobile applications is paramount. Exposing API keys, user credentials, or any other private information can lead to serious security breaches. Fortunately, Expo provides a powerful and easy-to-use solution: **Expo SecureStore**. This blog post will guide you through everything you need to know about Expo SecureStore, from installation and basic usage to advanced techniques and best practices.

## What is Expo SecureStore?

Expo SecureStore is a module within the Expo framework that provides a secure and encrypted way to store small amounts of data on the device's secure storage systems. Under the hood, it leverages the native security mechanisms of iOS and Android:

- **iOS:** `Keychain Services` for storing data securely.
- **Android:** `KeyStore` system, with fallback to `Shared Preferences` encrypted with a key stored in the `KeyStore` if `KeyStore` isn't available.

This abstraction allows developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of directly interacting with platform-specific security APIs. Expo SecureStore handles the encryption and decryption of your data, ensuring that it's protected from unauthorized access.

## Why Use Expo SecureStore?

- **Enhanced Security:** Data is encrypted at rest, protecting it from unauthorized access even if the device is compromised.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Write code once and it works seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
- **Simplified Development:** The Expo SecureStore API is simple and intuitive, making it easy to integrate into your projects.
- **Expo Ecosystem Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Expo modules.
- **Handles Keychain/Keystore Differences:** Abstracts away platform-specific nuances.
- **Better than plain AsyncStorage:** AsyncStorage stores data in plain text, making it vulnerable. SecureStore encrypts the data.

## Installation

To install Expo SecureStore in your Expo or React Native project, run the following command:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-secure-store
```

This command will install the necessary native modules and JavaScript libraries required for SecureStore to function.

## Basic Usage: Storing and Retrieving Data

The core functionality of Expo SecureStore revolves around two key methods: `setItemAsync` and `getItemAsync`.

### Storing Data: `setItemAsync`

The `setItemAsync` method is used to store a key-value pair securely. It takes two arguments:

- **key:** A string representing the key under which the data will be stored.
- **value:** A string representing the data to be stored. **Important: SecureStore only supports string values.** You'll need to serialize other data types (e.g., objects, arrays) to strings before storing them and parse them back when retrieving them.

Here's an example of storing an API token:

```plaintext
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store'

async function saveToken(key, value) {
  try {
    await SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value)
    console.log('Token saved successfully!')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving token:', error)
  }
}

// Example usage:
saveToken('api_token', 'YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE')
```

### Retrieving Data: `getItemAsync`

The `getItemAsync` method is used to retrieve data stored under a specific key. It takes one argument:

- **key:** A string representing the key of the data to retrieve.

The method returns a promise that resolves to the stored value (as a string) or `null` if the key doesn't exist.

```plaintext
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store'

async function getToken(key) {
  try {
    const token = await SecureStore.getItemAsync(key)
    if (token) {
      console.log('Token retrieved successfully:', token)
      return token
    } else {
      console.log('No token found for key:', key)
      return null
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving token:', error)
    return null
  }
}

// Example usage:
getToken('api_token').then((token) => {
  if (token) {
    // Use the token
  } else {
    // Handle the case where the token is not found
  }
})
```

### Deleting Data: `deleteItemAsync`

To remove a value stored in SecureStore, use the `deleteItemAsync` method:

```plaintext
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store'

async function deleteToken(key) {
  try {
    await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(key)
    console.log(`Token with key '${key}' deleted successfully!`)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error deleting token with key '${key}':`, error)
  }
}

// Example usage:
deleteToken('api_token')
```

## Advanced Usage and Best Practices

### Storing Objects

As mentioned earlier, SecureStore only supports storing string values. To store objects or arrays, you need to serialize them to JSON strings using `JSON.stringify` before storing them and parse them back using `JSON.parse` when retrieving them.

```plaintext
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store'

async function saveUserData(key, userData) {
  try {
    const serializedUserData = JSON.stringify(userData)
    await SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, serializedUserData)
    console.log('User data saved successfully!')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving user data:', error)
  }
}

async function getUserData(key) {
  try {
    const serializedUserData = await SecureStore.getItemAsync(key)
    if (serializedUserData) {
      const userData = JSON.parse(serializedUserData)
      console.log('User data retrieved successfully:', userData)
      return userData
    } else {
      console.log('No user data found for key:', key)
      return null
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving user data:', error)
    return null
  }
}

// Example usage:
const user = {
  id: 123,
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
}

saveUserData('user_data', user)

getUserData('user_data').then((userData) => {
  if (userData) {
    console.log('User name:', userData.name)
  }
})
```

### Error Handling

It's crucial to implement proper error handling when working with SecureStore. Potential errors include:

- **SecureStore is unavailable:** This can happen if the underlying secure storage system is not available or if the device doesn't support secure storage.
- **Encryption/Decryption errors:** These errors can occur if there's an issue with the encryption or decryption process.
- **Storage quota exceeded:** SecureStore has a limited storage quota.

Wrap your SecureStore operations in `try...catch` blocks to handle these errors gracefully. Provide informative error messages to the user and consider fallback mechanisms if SecureStore is unavailable.

### Key Management

- **Use descriptive and unique keys:** Choose keys that are meaningful and avoid using generic names that could conflict with other libraries or modules. For example, use `your_app_name_api_token` instead of just `api_token`.
- **Avoid storing sensitive information in keys:** Keys are not encrypted, so avoid including sensitive data in the key name itself.

### Security Considerations

- **Use SecureStore for sensitive data only:** Don't store non-sensitive data in SecureStore. Use AsyncStorage or other storage mechanisms for data that doesn't require encryption.
- **Be mindful of storage quota:** SecureStore has a limited storage quota. Avoid storing large amounts of data in SecureStore.
- **Keep your Expo SDK and SecureStore library up to date:** Regularly update your Expo SDK and SecureStore library to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.
- **Implement proper authentication and authorization:** SecureStore is not a replacement for proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. Ensure that your application uses secure authentication and authorization protocols.
- **Consider using biometric authentication:** Integrate biometric authentication (e.g., Face ID, Touch ID) to further enhance the security of your application.
- **Be aware of root/jailbreak detection:** Implement root/jailbreak detection to prevent your application from running on compromised devices.

### Asynchronous Operations

Remember that all SecureStore operations are asynchronous. Use `async/await` or `.then()` to handle the promises returned by the methods correctly. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **"SecureStore is not available" error:** This often occurs on emulators/simulators or devices that don't support secure storage. Try running your application on a physical device. If using an emulator, ensure you are using a simulator that supports secure hardware. Also check if the device is rooted or jailbroken, which can disable SecureStore.
- **Data not persisting:** Double-check that you are using `await` or `.then()` to handle the promises returned by SecureStore methods. Also, ensure that you are using the correct keys when storing and retrieving data.
- **Incorrect data being returned:** Verify that you are parsing the JSON correctly when retrieving objects stored as strings.

## Example: Storing User Credentials

Here's a more complete example of how to store user credentials securely using Expo SecureStore:

```plaintext
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store'

async function saveCredentials(username, password) {
  try {
    await SecureStore.setItemAsync('username', username)
    await SecureStore.setItemAsync('password', password)
    console.log('Credentials saved securely!')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving credentials:', error)
  }
}

async function getCredentials() {
  try {
    const username = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('username')
    const password = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('password')

    if (username && password) {
      console.log('Credentials retrieved successfully!')
      return { username, password }
    } else {
      console.log('No credentials found.')
      return null
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving credentials:', error)
    return null
  }
}

async function deleteCredentials() {
  try {
    await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('username')
    await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('password')
    console.log('Credentials deleted successfully!')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting credentials:', error)
  }
}

// Example Usage (replace with your actual login logic)
async function handleLogin(username, password) {
  await saveCredentials(username, password)
  // ... your login logic ...
}

async function handleLogout() {
  await deleteCredentials()
  // ... your logout logic ...
}

async function checkStoredCredentials() {
  const credentials = await getCredentials()
  if (credentials) {
    console.log('User already logged in.')
    // Auto login or other logic
  } else {
    console.log('User is not logged in.')
  }
}

// Call this on app startup
checkStoredCredentials()
```

**Important Security Note:** While this example demonstrates storing user credentials, consider using more robust authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 or passwordless authentication whenever possible. Storing passwords directly, even securely, introduces inherent risks. Salting and hashing passwords before storage _significantly_ improves security. Never store passwords in plain text.
