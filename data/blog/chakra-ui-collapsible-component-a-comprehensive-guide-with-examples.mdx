# Chakra UI Collapsible Component: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Collapsible components are a powerful tool in user interface (UI) design. They allow you to hide and reveal content dynamically, improving readability and reducing clutter on your website or application. Chakra UI, a popular component library for React, provides an elegant and accessible way to implement collapsible components. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about using collapsible components in Chakra UI, from basic implementation to advanced customization.

## Why Use Collapsible Components?

Before diving into the code, let's understand why you might want to use collapsible components:

- **Improved User Experience (UX):** Collapsible sections allow users to focus on the information that is most relevant to them, preventing information overload. By hiding less frequently accessed content, you create a cleaner, more streamlined interface.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Long blocks of text can be daunting for users. Breaking content into collapsible sections makes it more digestible and easier to scan.
- **Reduced Clutter:** Especially on content-rich pages, collapsible components help reduce visual clutter, making the page less overwhelming.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** You can use collapsible components to implement progressive disclosure, revealing more information as the user interacts with the interface. This is useful for complex forms or tutorials.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Collapsible sections are particularly beneficial on smaller screens, where space is limited. They allow you to present a large amount of information without sacrificing usability.

## Getting Started with Chakra UI

If you haven't already, install Chakra UI and its peer dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

Or using yarn:

```plaintext
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

Next, wrap your application with the `ChakraProvider` to enable Chakra UI components:

```plaintext
// pages/_app.js or pages/_app.tsx

import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

## Implementing a Basic Collapsible Component

Chakra UI doesn't have a single, dedicated "Collapsible" component. Instead, you'll achieve this functionality using a combination of other components, primarily `Collapse` and potentially `Box`, `Button`, and state management (using `useState` or similar).

Here's a basic example of how to create a collapsible section using `Collapse` and a button to toggle its visibility:

```plaintext
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Box, Button, Collapse } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function BasicCollapsible() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

  const handleToggle = () => setShow(!show)

  return (
    <Box>
      <Button onClick={handleToggle} mt="1rem">
        Show {show ? 'Less' : 'More'}
      </Button>
      <Collapse in={show} animateOpacity>
        <Box mt="0.5rem" p="1rem" bg="gray.100" rounded="md" shadow="sm">
          This is the content that will be collapsed or expanded. You can include any HTML elements,
          components, or data here. This example uses a Box with some styling for better visibility.
          This is an example demonstrating the flexibility of content allowed. This content can be
          more complex, perhaps containing data fetched from an API.
        </Box>
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default BasicCollapsible
```

**Explanation:**

- **`useState(false)`:** This hook initializes a state variable `show` to `false`, meaning the content is initially hidden.
- **`handleToggle()`:** This function toggles the `show` state variable.
- **`Button`:** This button calls the `handleToggle` function when clicked, updating the state and triggering the collapse or expand animation. The button text dynamically changes between "Show More" and "Show Less" based on the `show` state.
- **`Collapse in={show} animateOpacity`:** The `Collapse` component is the key to the collapsible behavior.
  - `in={show}`: This prop determines whether the content inside the `Collapse` component is visible. It's bound to the `show` state variable.
  - `animateOpacity`: This prop enables a fade-in/fade-out animation when the content is collapsed or expanded. It provides a smoother visual transition.
- **`Box`:** This `Box` component serves as a container for the content that will be collapsed. It provides a convenient way to add styling (background color, padding, rounded corners, shadow) to the content. You can replace this with any other Chakra UI component or a custom React component.

## Customizing the Collapsible Component

Chakra UI provides extensive customization options. Let's explore some ways to customize the collapsible component:

### 1. Changing the Animation

The `Collapse` component supports different animations. Besides `animateOpacity`, you can use `animateHeight` or create custom animations using `motion`.

**Example with `animateHeight`:**

```plaintext
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Box, Button, Collapse } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function HeightCollapsible() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

  const handleToggle = () => setShow(!show)

  return (
    <Box>
      <Button onClick={handleToggle} mt="1rem">
        Show {show ? 'Less' : 'More'}
      </Button>
      <Collapse in={show} animateHeight>
        <Box mt="0.5rem" p="1rem" bg="gray.100" rounded="md" shadow="sm">
          This content will expand and collapse in height. It's a good choice when you want a smooth
          vertical transition.
        </Box>
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default HeightCollapsible
```

In this example, the content expands and collapses by animating its height.

### 2. Styling the Button

You can customize the button's appearance using Chakra UI's styling props.

**Example with custom button styles:**

```plaintext
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Box, Button, Collapse } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function StyledButtonCollapsible() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

  const handleToggle = () => setShow(!show)

  return (
    <Box>
      <Button onClick={handleToggle} mt="1rem" colorScheme="blue" size="sm" variant="outline">
        {show ? 'Hide Details' : 'Show Details'}
      </Button>
      <Collapse in={show} animateOpacity>
        <Box mt="0.5rem" p="1rem" bg="gray.100" rounded="md" shadow="sm">
          This content is revealed when the custom styled button is clicked.
        </Box>
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default StyledButtonCollapsible
```

This example uses `colorScheme`, `size`, and `variant` props to style the button. The button text is also more descriptive, reflecting the specific content being revealed.

### 3. Using Icons

Adding icons to the button can further enhance the user experience.

**Example with icons:**

```plaintext
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Box, Button, Collapse, Icon } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { ChevronDownIcon, ChevronUpIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons'

function IconCollapsible() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

  const handleToggle = () => setShow(!show)

  return (
    <Box>
      <Button
        onClick={handleToggle}
        mt="1rem"
        rightIcon={show ? <ChevronUpIcon /> : <ChevronDownIcon />}
      >
        {show ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}
      </Button>
      <Collapse in={show} animateOpacity>
        <Box mt="0.5rem" p="1rem" bg="gray.100" rounded="md" shadow="sm">
          This section collapses or expands, indicated by the chevron icon.
        </Box>
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default IconCollapsible
```

This example uses `ChevronDownIcon` and `ChevronUpIcon` to visually indicate whether the content is collapsed or expanded.

### 4. Creating a Custom Header

Instead of a button, you can use any component as the trigger for the collapse. This provides greater flexibility in designing the interaction.

**Example with a custom header:**

```plaintext
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Box, Heading, Collapse } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function CustomHeaderCollapsible() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false)

  const handleToggle = () => setShow(!show)

  return (
    <Box>
      <Heading
        as="h3"
        size="md"
        cursor="pointer"
        onClick={handleToggle}
        _hover={{ color: 'blue.500' }}
      >
        Click to Toggle Content
      </Heading>
      <Collapse in={show} animateOpacity>
        <Box mt="0.5rem" p="1rem" bg="gray.100" rounded="md" shadow="sm">
          This content is toggled by clicking on the heading. This demonstrates using a non-button
          element as the trigger.
        </Box>
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default CustomHeaderCollapsible
```

In this example, a `Heading` component is used as the toggle. The `cursor="pointer"` and `_hover` styles provide visual feedback to the user that the heading is clickable.

## Accessibility Considerations

When implementing collapsible components, it's crucial to consider accessibility to ensure that users with disabilities can use them effectively.

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that users can navigate and interact with the collapsible trigger using the keyboard. This usually means the trigger should be a `<button>` element or have `tabIndex="0"` and appropriate ARIA attributes if using a different element.
- **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes to provide semantic information about the collapsible section to assistive technologies. Specifically:
  - `aria-expanded`: Indicates whether the section is currently expanded.
  - `aria-controls`: Identifies the element that is being controlled by the trigger.

**Example with ARIA attributes:**

```plaintext
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Box, Button, Collapse, useId } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function AccessibleCollapsible() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false)
  const handleToggle = () => setShow(!show)
  const contentId = useId() // Generate a unique ID

  return (
    <Box>
      <Button onClick={handleToggle} aria-expanded={show} aria-controls={contentId} mt="1rem">
        {show ? 'Hide Content' : 'Show Content'}
      </Button>
      <Collapse in={show} animateOpacity id={contentId}>
        <Box mt="0.5rem" p="1rem" bg="gray.100" rounded="md" shadow="sm">
          This content is accessible with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
        </Box>
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default AccessibleCollapsible
```

In this example:

- `useId()` is a React hook that generates a unique ID. This is used to link the button with the collapsible content.
- `aria-expanded={show}` is set on the button to indicate whether the content is currently expanded.
- `aria-controls={contentId}` is set on the button to identify the element that is being controlled by the button (i.e., the collapsible content). The `id={contentId}` is set on the Collapse component so that the button's `aria-controls` value matches it.

By using these ARIA attributes, you provide crucial information to screen readers and other assistive technologies, making your collapsible components more accessible.

## Advanced Usage: Accordions

An accordion is a variation of the collapsible component where only one section can be open at a time. While Chakra UI doesn't have a dedicated `Accordion` component, you can easily build one using the techniques we've already covered. The key is to manage the state so that only one section is open at a time.

**Example Accordion Component:**

```plaintext
import { useState } from 'react'
import { Box, Button, Collapse } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function AccordionItem({ title, children, isOpen, onToggle }) {
  return (
    <Box mb="1rem">
      <Button onClick={onToggle} width="100%" textAlign="left">
        {title}
      </Button>
      <Collapse in={isOpen} animateOpacity>
        <Box p="1rem" bg="gray.100" rounded="md" shadow="sm">
          {children}
        </Box>
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  )
}

function Accordion({ items }) {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(null)

  const handleToggle = (index) => {
    setActiveIndex(activeIndex === index ? null : index)
  }

  return (
    <Box>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <AccordionItem
          key={index}
          title={item.title}
          isOpen={activeIndex === index}
          onToggle={() => handleToggle(index)}
        >
          {item.content}
        </AccordionItem>
      ))}
    </Box>
  )
}

function MyComponent() {
  const accordionItems = [
    { title: 'Section 1', content: 'Content for Section 1.' },
    { title: 'Section 2', content: 'Content for Section 2.' },
    { title: 'Section 3', content: 'Content for Section 3.' },
  ]

  return <Accordion items={accordionItems} />
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Explanation:**

- **`AccordionItem`:** This component represents a single section in the accordion. It receives the title, content, and an `isOpen` prop to determine whether it's open. The `onToggle` prop is a function that's called when the section is toggled.
- **`Accordion`:** This component manages the state of the accordion.
  - `activeIndex`: This state variable stores the index of the currently active (open) section. If no section is open, it's `null`.
  - `handleToggle()`: This function updates the `activeIndex` state. If the clicked section is already active, it closes it (sets `activeIndex` to `null`). Otherwise, it opens the clicked section and closes any other open sections.
- **Mapping Items:** The `Accordion` component iterates through an array of `items` (passed as props) and renders an `AccordionItem` for each one. It passes the necessary props (title, isOpen, onToggle) to each `AccordionItem`.
- **`MyComponent` (Example):** This component demonstrates how to use the `Accordion` component with some sample data.

## Conclusion

Collapsible components are a valuable tool for enhancing user experience and simplifying complex interfaces. Chakra UI makes it easy to implement and customize these components with its flexible and accessible building blocks. By understanding the principles outlined in this guide and experimenting with different customization options, you can create collapsible components that meet the specific needs of your application and provide a seamless user experience for everyone. Remember to prioritize accessibility by using appropriate ARIA attributes and ensuring keyboard navigability. Happy coding!
