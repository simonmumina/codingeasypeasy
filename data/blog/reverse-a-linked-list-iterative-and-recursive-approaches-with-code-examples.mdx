# Reverse a Linked List: Iterative and Recursive Approaches with Code Examples

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science, widely used in various applications. One common operation on linked lists is reversing the order of its nodes. This blog post will explore two popular methods for reversing a linked list: the iterative approach and the recursive approach. We'll provide detailed explanations, code examples in JavaScript, and discuss the complexities involved. This guide is perfect for anyone preparing for technical interviews or looking to deepen their understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Understanding Linked Lists

Before diving into reversing, let's briefly define what a linked list is. A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains two parts:

- **Data:** The value stored within the node.
- **Next:** A pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence. The last node's `next` pointer typically points to `null`.

Here's a simple JavaScript representation of a linked list node:

```plaintext
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

## The Iterative Approach to Reversing a Linked List

The iterative approach involves traversing the linked list and changing the `next` pointers of each node to point to the previous node. We use three pointers:

- `prev`: Keeps track of the previously visited node. Initially, it's set to `null`.
- `current`: Represents the current node being processed. Initially, it's set to the head of the linked list.
- `next`: Temporarily stores the next node in the list before we modify the `current` node's `next` pointer.

Here's the algorithm:

1.  Initialize `prev` to `null`, `current` to the head of the list.
2.  While `current` is not `null`:
    - Store the next node in the `next` pointer.
    - Change the `current` node's `next` pointer to point to `prev`.
    - Move `prev` to `current`.
    - Move `current` to `next`.
3.  After the loop, `prev` will point to the new head of the reversed list.

Here's the JavaScript code implementation:

```plaintext
function reverseLinkedListIterative(head) {
  let prev = null;
  let current = head;
  let next = null;

  while (current !== null) {
    next = current.next; // Store next node
    current.next = prev; // Reverse current node's pointer
    prev = current;      // Move pointers one position ahead
    current = next;
  }

  return prev; // prev is now the new head
}

// Example Usage:
// Create a sample linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null
const head = new Node(1);
head.next = new Node(2);
head.next.next = new Node(3);
head.next.next.next = new Node(4);
head.next.next.next.next = new Node(5);

const reversedHead = reverseLinkedListIterative(head);

// Function to print the linked list for verification (optional)
function printLinkedList(head) {
    let current = head;
    let output = "";
    while (current !== null) {
        output += current.data + " -> ";
        current = current.next;
    }
    output += "null";
    console.log(output);
}

console.log("Original Linked List:");
printLinkedList(head); // 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null (head is changed!)

console.log("Reversed Linked List:");
printLinkedList(reversedHead); // 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through each node once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space to store the `prev`, `current`, and `next` pointers.

## The Recursive Approach to Reversing a Linked List

The recursive approach involves reversing the list starting from the second node, and then making the last node point back to the first node.

Here's the algorithm:

1.  **Base Case:** If the list is empty or has only one node, return the head (already reversed).
2.  Recursively reverse the rest of the list (from the second node onwards).
3.  Let `reversedHead` be the head of the reversed sublist.
4.  Make the `next` of the second node (which is currently pointing forward) point to the first node (the head of the original list). Specifically: `head.next.next = head;`
5.  Set the `next` of the first node to `null`: `head.next = null;` (This is crucial to terminate the reversed list).
6.  Return `reversedHead`.

Here's the JavaScript code implementation:

```plaintext
function reverseLinkedListRecursive(head) {
  // Base case: empty list or single node
  if (head === null || head.next === null) {
    return head;
  }

  // Recursively reverse the rest of the list
  const reversedHead = reverseLinkedListRecursive(head.next);

  // Make the second node point back to the first node
  head.next.next = head;

  // Set the first node's next pointer to null
  head.next = null;

  return reversedHead;
}

// Example Usage:
// We reuse the same linked list from the iterative example
const head2 = new Node(1);
head2.next = new Node(2);
head2.next.next = new Node(3);
head2.next.next.next = new Node(4);
head2.next.next.next.next = new Node(5);

const reversedHead2 = reverseLinkedListRecursive(head2);

console.log("Original Linked List (head2):");
printLinkedList(head2); //1 -> null //1's next is now null!  The remaining list is severed.

console.log("Reversed Linked List (head2):");
printLinkedList(reversedHead2); // 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The function is called recursively for each node once.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the call stack of the recursive function. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack until the base case is reached.

## Choosing Between Iterative and Recursive

Both the iterative and recursive approaches correctly reverse a linked list. Here's a summary to help you decide which to use:

- **Iterative:**

  - More efficient in terms of space complexity (O(1) vs. O(n)).
  - Generally easier to understand and debug for many developers.
  - Avoids the risk of stack overflow errors with very large lists.

- **Recursive:**
  - Can be more elegant and concise, showcasing a deeper understanding of recursion.
  - Less efficient in terms of space complexity due to the call stack.
  - May lead to stack overflow errors with extremely long lists.

In most practical scenarios, the **iterative approach is preferred due to its better space complexity and reduced risk of stack overflow.** However, understanding the recursive approach is valuable for developing problem-solving skills and demonstrating your understanding of recursion.

## Common Interview Questions and Considerations

- **Handling Empty Lists:** Ensure your code correctly handles the case where the input linked list is empty (`head === null`). Both the iterative and recursive examples handle this case.
- **Modifying the Original List:** Both approaches modify the original linked list by changing the `next` pointers. If you need to preserve the original list, you'll need to create a copy first.
- **Doubly Linked Lists:** Reversing a doubly linked list is slightly simpler because you also need to update the `prev` pointers in each node.
- **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases like a list with only one or two nodes. Make sure your code handles these cases correctly.

## Conclusion

Reversing a linked list is a classic problem in computer science, and mastering both the iterative and recursive solutions is a valuable skill for any programmer. By understanding the algorithms, complexities, and trade-offs involved, you can confidently tackle this problem in interviews and real-world applications. Remember to choose the iterative approach when space efficiency is crucial, and the recursive approach when conciseness and elegance are preferred, while being mindful of the potential for stack overflow errors.
