# Compressed Sensing: A Comprehensive Guide to Sparsity, Recovery, and Applications

Compressed sensing (CS), also known as compressive sensing or sparse recovery, is a revolutionary signal processing technique that allows us to accurately reconstruct a signal from significantly fewer samples than required by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This counter-intuitive result is possible when the signal is _sparse_ in some domain, meaning it contains only a few significant components.

## The Problem with Traditional Sampling: Nyquist-Shannon

The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem dictates that to perfectly reconstruct a signal, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component present in the signal. This is often referred to as the Nyquist rate. While fundamental, this theorem can be inefficient when dealing with signals that have a sparse representation. Imagine capturing a high-resolution image where most pixels are essentially black. Storing all pixel values wastes significant resources.

## Sparsity: The Key to Compressed Sensing

The cornerstone of compressed sensing is the concept of **sparsity**. A signal is considered sparse if it can be represented with only a few non-zero coefficients in a suitable basis or domain. This means most of the signal's energy is concentrated in a small number of components.

**Mathematical Definition:**

A signal `x` of length `N` is considered _K-sparse_ if it has at most `K` non-zero coefficients in some basis `Ψ`. This can be written as:

`x = Ψs`

where `s` is a vector of coefficients, and `s` has at most `K` non-zero entries (i.e., `||s||_0 ≤ K`). Here, `||s||_0` denotes the L0 "norm", which counts the number of non-zero elements in `s`.

**Examples of Sparse Signals:**

- **Images:** Many images are sparse in the wavelet domain. After a wavelet transform, most of the coefficients are close to zero.
- **Audio:** Certain audio signals, like speech, can be sparse in the time-frequency domain (e.g., using the Short-Time Fourier Transform).
- **Medical Imaging:** MRI and CT scans can often be sparsified using appropriate transforms.

## The Compressed Sensing Paradigm

Compressed sensing tackles the following problem: Given a sparse signal `x` of length `N`, can we recover it from `M` measurements, where `M < N`? The answer, surprisingly, is yes, under certain conditions.

The basic CS model can be represented as:

`y = Ax`

where:

- `y` is the vector of `M` measurements (often referred to as the observation vector).
- `A` is an `M x N` measurement matrix (also called the sensing matrix), with `M < N`.
- `x` is the unknown `N`-dimensional signal we want to recover.

Since `M < N`, this is an underdetermined system of linear equations, meaning it has infinitely many solutions. However, because we know `x` is sparse, we can find a unique solution.

## The Role of the Measurement Matrix (A)

The measurement matrix `A` plays a crucial role in compressed sensing. It must satisfy certain properties to ensure accurate signal recovery. The most important property is the **Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)**.

**Restricted Isometry Property (RIP):**

A matrix `A` satisfies the RIP of order `K` with constant `δ_K ∈ (0, 1)` if:

`(1 - δ_K) ||x||_2^2 ≤ ||Ax||_2^2 ≤ (1 + δ_K) ||x||_2^2`

for all `K`-sparse vectors `x`. This essentially means that `A` preserves the lengths of `K`-sparse vectors. Informally, `A` should "act like an isometry" when restricted to sparse vectors.

**Common Choices for Measurement Matrices:**

- **Gaussian Random Matrices:** Matrices with entries drawn from a Gaussian distribution are known to satisfy the RIP with high probability.
- **Bernoulli Random Matrices:** Matrices with entries randomly chosen from {+1, -1} are also suitable.
- **Partial Fourier Matrices:** Subsets of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix can also be used.

## Signal Recovery Algorithms

The goal is to recover the sparse signal `x` from the measurements `y` and the measurement matrix `A`. This involves solving the underdetermined linear system `y = Ax`. Because of the sparsity constraint, we can use optimization techniques to find the solution.

**1. L1-Minimization (Basis Pursuit):**

The most common approach is to solve the following optimization problem:

`minimize ||s||_1  subject to  y = AΨs`

where:

- `||s||_1` is the L1-norm of `s` (sum of the absolute values of the elements). This promotes sparsity.
- `Ψ` is the sparsifying basis (e.g., wavelet basis). If `x` is already sparse, `Ψ` is the identity matrix.

The L1-norm is used as a convex relaxation of the non-convex L0 "norm". Under certain conditions, the solution to the L1-minimization problem is guaranteed to be the same as the solution to the L0-minimization problem (i.e., the true sparse solution).

**2. Greedy Algorithms:**

Greedy algorithms iteratively build the signal by selecting the most significant components. Examples include:

- **Matching Pursuit (MP):** Iteratively selects the atom in `Ψ` that best matches the residual.
- **Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP):** Similar to MP, but ensures that the selected atoms are orthogonal to the previously selected ones.

**3. Iterative Thresholding Algorithms:**

These algorithms iteratively threshold the signal coefficients to enforce sparsity. Examples include:

- **Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA):** Applies a soft thresholding operator to the signal coefficients in each iteration.
- **Fast Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA):** An accelerated version of ISTA.

## Code Examples (Python)

Here are some code examples using Python with the NumPy and SciPy libraries to illustrate compressed sensing concepts. We'll use L1-minimization for signal recovery.

```plaintext
import numpy as np
import scipy.optimize

# Generate a sparse signal
N = 256  # Signal length
K = 20   # Number of non-zero components
s = np.zeros(N)
indices = np.random.choice(N, K, replace=False)
s[indices] = np.random.randn(K)  # Random values for non-zero components
x = s  # Signal in the original domain (identity basis)

# Generate a measurement matrix (Gaussian)
M = 64  # Number of measurements
A = np.random.randn(M, N)

# Generate measurements
y = A @ x

# L1-Minimization for signal recovery
def l1_minimization(A, y, x0, tol=1e-6, maxiter=1000):
  """Solves the L1-minimization problem using scipy.optimize.minimize."""
  # Define the objective function
  def objective(x):
      return np.linalg.norm(x, 1)

  # Define the constraint function (A @ x = y)
  def constraint(x):
      return A @ x - y

  # Define the Jacobian of the constraint function (A)
  jac = A

  # Define the constraints dictionary
  constraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint, 'jac': jac})

  # Use scipy.optimize.minimize to solve the optimization problem
  result = scipy.optimize.minimize(objective, x0, method='SLSQP', jac=None, constraints=constraints, options={'ftol': tol, 'maxiter': maxiter, 'disp': False})

  return result.x

# Initial guess (zero vector)
x0 = np.zeros(N)

# Solve the L1-minimization problem
x_recovered = l1_minimization(A, y, x0)


# Evaluate the reconstruction error
error = np.linalg.norm(x - x_recovered) / np.linalg.norm(x)
print(f"Relative Reconstruction Error: {error:.4f}")

# Optional: Visualize the results (requires matplotlib)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.stem(x, label="Original Signal")
plt.title("Original Sparse Signal")
plt.xlabel("Index")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.stem(x_recovered, label="Recovered Signal")

```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **Generate a Sparse Signal:** We create a signal `x` of length `N` with `K` randomly chosen non-zero components.
2.  **Generate a Measurement Matrix:** We create a Gaussian random matrix `A` of size `M x N`, where `M < N`.
3.  **Generate Measurements:** We compute the measurements `y` by multiplying the measurement matrix `A` with the sparse signal `x`.
4.  **L1-Minimization:** We use the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to solve the L1-minimization problem. This involves defining the objective function (L1-norm) and the constraint (Ax = y). The 'SLSQP' solver is a suitable choice for constrained optimization problems. An initial guess is provided to help the optimization process.
5.  **Evaluate Reconstruction Error:** We calculate the relative reconstruction error to assess the accuracy of the recovered signal.
6.  **Visualization (Optional):** We use Matplotlib to plot the original and recovered signals, allowing for visual comparison.

**Using a Sparsifying Basis (Wavelet Transform Example):**

This example uses PyWavelets to perform a wavelet transform and recover the signal in the wavelet domain. It assumes you have PyWavelets installed (`pip install pywavelets`).

```plaintext
import numpy as np
import scipy.optimize
import pywt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a signal that is sparse in the wavelet domain
N = 256
K = 20
signal = np.zeros(N)
# Create some spikes to make the wavelet transform sparse
indices = np.random.choice(N, K, replace=False)
signal[indices] = np.random.randn(K)


# Choose a wavelet basis (e.g., 'db4')
wavelet = 'db4'

# Perform the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
coeffs = pywt.wavedec(signal, wavelet, level=5)
s = np.concatenate(coeffs) # Flatten the coefficients into a single vector.

# Generate a measurement matrix (Gaussian)
M = 64
A = np.random.randn(M, N)

# Generate measurements
y = A @ signal  # Measure the *original* signal, not the wavelet coefficients


# Now, the L1 minimization needs to recover the *wavelet coefficients* that
# reconstruct the original signal given the measurements y.
# This requires a basis transform.

# Create a matrix that transforms wavelet coefficients back into the signal domain.
# This is achieved by approximating the inverse wavelet transform as a matrix.

# First, a function that reconstructs the signal from wavelet coefficients:
def reconstruct(coeffs_vec, wavelet, level):
    coeff_slices = pywt.coeffs_to_array(coeffs_vec, output_format="wavedec", separate=True)
    signal_reconstructed = pywt.waverec(coeff_slices[1:], wavelet)
    return signal_reconstructed

# Approximate the reconstruction with a matrix:
Psi = np.zeros((N, N))  # Matrix representation of inverse wavelet transform.
for i in range(N):
    # Create a delta function in the coefficient domain:
    delta_coeffs = np.zeros(N)
    delta_coeffs[i] = 1
    # Reconstruct the signal corresponding to the delta function and store it as column i
    Psi[:, i] = reconstruct(delta_coeffs, wavelet, 5)

# Now perform L1 minimization to reconstruct the *coefficients* in the *wavelet* domain
x0 = np.zeros(N)
def l1_minimization(A, y, Psi, x0, tol=1e-6, maxiter=1000):
    """Solves the L1-minimization problem with a sparsifying basis Psi."""
    # Define the objective function
    def objective(x):
        return np.linalg.norm(x, 1)

    # Define the constraint function (A @ Psi @ x = y)
    def constraint(x):
        return A @ Psi @ x - y

    # Define the Jacobian of the constraint function (A @ Psi)
    jac = A @ Psi

    # Define the constraints dictionary
    constraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint, 'jac': jac})

    # Use scipy.optimize.minimize to solve the optimization problem
    result = scipy.optimize.minimize(objective, x0, method='SLSQP', jac=None, constraints=constraints, options={'ftol': tol, 'maxiter': maxiter, 'disp': False})

    return result.x

# Solve the L1-minimization problem to recover the wavelet coefficients
s_recovered = l1_minimization(A, y, Psi, x0)
# Reconstruct the original signal from recovered wavelet coefficients
signal_recovered = reconstruct(s_recovered, wavelet, 5)

# Evaluate the reconstruction error
error = np.linalg.norm(signal - signal_recovered) / np.linalg.norm(signal)
print(f"Relative Reconstruction Error: {error:.4f}")


# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

plt.plot(signal, label="Original Signal")

plt.xlabel("Index")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude")

**Key Points for Wavelet Example:**

- **Wavelet Transform:** `pywt.wavedec` performs the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The levels of decomposition should be less than log2(N)
- **Measurement Matrix:** The measurement `y = A @ signal` where `signal` is the original signal. The signal is sparse in wavelet domain, but not in its original domain.
- **Sparsifying Basis:** The recovery is modified. The sparsifying basis matrix `Psi` is created to map _back_ from the wavelet coefficients to the signal domain. The constraint now becomes `A @ Psi @ s = y` where s is a vector of the wavelet coefficients that we need to find via L1 minimization.
- **Reconstruction:** The `reconstruct()` function converts the recovered wavelet coefficient `s` to the recovered signal `signal_recovered`.

This more complex example showcases the full compressed sensing pipeline, where the signal needs to be transformed to a sparse domain before being sampled.

## Applications of Compressed Sensing
