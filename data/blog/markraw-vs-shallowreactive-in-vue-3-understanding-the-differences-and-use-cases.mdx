# markRaw vs shallowReactive in Vue 3: Understanding the Differences and Use Cases

Vue 3's reactivity system is powerful, but sometimes you need more control over how reactivity works. This is where `markRaw` and `shallowReactive` come in. They allow you to selectively disable or limit reactivity for specific objects, which can be crucial for performance optimization and managing external libraries. This post will delve into the differences between `markRaw` and `shallowReactive`, exploring their use cases with practical code examples.

## Understanding Vue 3's Reactivity System

Before diving into the specifics of `markRaw` and `shallowReactive`, let's briefly recap Vue 3's reactivity system. At its core, Vue 3 uses proxies to track changes to JavaScript objects. When you modify a reactive property, Vue triggers updates to the components that depend on that property. This ensures that your UI always reflects the latest data.

However, deep reactivity—where changes to nested properties within an object trigger updates—can be computationally expensive, especially for large or complex objects.  That's where tools like `markRaw` and `shallowReactive` become valuable.

## What is `markRaw`?

`markRaw` is a function in Vue 3 that allows you to prevent an object from ever becoming reactive.  Once an object is marked as raw, Vue's reactivity system completely ignores it and any of its nested properties. This means:

*   Changes to the object will not trigger any updates in your Vue components.
*   You cannot make the object reactive later.  It's marked as raw permanently.
*   It's useful for wrapping objects from external libraries that manage their own state or for objects where reactivity is simply not needed.
*   It applies *deeply*, meaning any nested objects within the `markRaw` object are also not reactive.

**When to use `markRaw`:**

*   **Integrating with external libraries:**  When working with libraries like Immutable.js or other state management solutions that handle their own change detection, you can use `markRaw` to prevent Vue from interfering.
*   **Large, unchanging datasets:** If you have a large dataset that is rarely or never updated, marking it as raw can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary reactivity overhead.
*   **Optimizing performance:** If you know that a particular object doesn't need to be reactive, using `markRaw` can reduce the overhead of the reactivity system.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import { reactive, markRaw, ref } from 'vue';

const nonReactiveObject = {
  name: 'Non-Reactive Object',
  value: 10,
  nested: {
    data: 'Nested Data'
  }
};

markRaw(nonReactiveObject);

const reactiveData = reactive({
  message: 'Hello Vue!',
  obj: nonReactiveObject // Embedding the non-reactive object
});

// Modifying nonReactiveObject will NOT trigger updates in the component
nonReactiveObject.value = 20;
nonReactiveObject.nested.data = 'Updated Nested Data';

console.log(reactiveData.obj.value); // Output: 20 (Value changed, but no reactivity)
console.log(reactiveData.obj.nested.data); // Output: Updated Nested Data (Value changed, but no reactivity)

// Modifying reactiveData.message WILL trigger updates in the component
reactiveData.message = 'Hello Vue 3!';
```

In this example, `nonReactiveObject` is marked as raw.  Changes to its properties do not trigger any updates in the Vue component, even when it's nested within a reactive object.  This demonstrates how `markRaw` completely disables reactivity for the target object and its nested properties.

## What is `shallowReactive`?

`shallowReactive` creates a reactive object, but only makes the *top-level* properties reactive.  This means that if a property of the shallow reactive object is itself an object, modifications within that nested object will *not* trigger reactivity.

*   Changes to top-level properties will trigger updates.
*   Changes to nested properties within the object will *not* trigger updates.
*   It can be useful when you only care about changes to the immediate properties of an object and want to avoid the overhead of deep reactivity.

**When to use `shallowReactive`:**

*   **Optimizing reactivity for large, nested objects:** When you only need to track changes to the immediate properties of an object and want to avoid the overhead of deeply reactive nested objects.
*   **Controlled reactivity:** When you want to explicitly manage the reactivity of nested objects yourself.
*   **Dealing with external data structures:** When you have data structures that already have their own change detection mechanisms and don't need to be deeply reactive.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
import { shallowReactive, ref } from 'vue';

const shallowReactiveObject = shallowReactive({
  name: 'Shallow Reactive Object',
  value: 10,
  nested: {
    data: 'Nested Data'
  }
});

const myRef = ref(0);

// Modifying the top-level properties will trigger updates
shallowReactiveObject.name = 'Updated Name'; // Triggers reactivity
myRef.value++;

// Modifying the nested object's properties will NOT trigger updates
shallowReactiveObject.nested.data = 'Updated Nested Data'; // Does NOT trigger reactivity

console.log(shallowReactiveObject.nested.data); // Output: Updated Nested Data (Value changed, but no reactivity)
```

In this example, changes to `shallowReactiveObject.name` will trigger updates because it's a top-level property. However, changes to `shallowReactiveObject.nested.data` will *not* trigger updates because it's within a nested object. This illustrates the "shallow" nature of `shallowReactive`.

## Key Differences Summarized

| Feature          | `markRaw`                                       | `shallowReactive`                                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Reactivity      | Completely disables reactivity for the object. | Enables reactivity only for top-level properties. |
| Depth           | Deep: Affects the object and all its nested properties.    | Shallow:  Only affects the top-level properties.      |
| Use Cases       | External libraries, unchanging data, performance optimization.       | Large nested objects where only top-level changes matter, controlled reactivity.     |
| Intended Purpose |  Prevent object from ever becoming reactive.  | Create a reactive object with limited depth of reactivity. |

## Choosing Between `markRaw` and `shallowReactive`

The choice between `markRaw` and `shallowReactive` depends on your specific needs:

*   **Use `markRaw` when:** You want to completely prevent an object from becoming reactive and ensure that no changes to it will trigger updates. This is ideal for integrating with external libraries or handling large, unchanging datasets.
*   **Use `shallowReactive` when:** You want some level of reactivity, but only for the top-level properties of an object. This is useful when you have large, nested objects and only care about changes to the immediate properties, or when you want to explicitly manage the reactivity of nested objects yourself.

## A Practical Example: Managing a Large Configuration Object

Imagine you have a large configuration object loaded from a JSON file that rarely changes. Applying deep reactivity to this object would be wasteful.

```javascript
import { reactive, markRaw, shallowReactive } from 'vue';

// Simulate loading a large configuration object
const config = {
  app: {
    name: 'My Application',
    version: '1.0.0',
    theme: {
      primaryColor: '#007bff',
      secondaryColor: '#6c757d',
      fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif'
    }
  },
  features: {
    analyticsEnabled: true,
    notificationsEnabled: false,
    loggingLevel: 'info'
  },
  // ... potentially many more nested properties
};


// Option 1: Using markRaw (if config never changes)
const rawConfig = markRaw(config);

// Option 2: Using shallowReactive (if only top-level properties need to be reactive)
const shallowConfig = shallowReactive(config);

//Using Reactive without any optimisation
const reactiveConfig = reactive(config);

// Choose based on whether the config needs to be reactive at all,
// or only at the top level
export { rawConfig, shallowConfig, reactiveConfig };
```

In this scenario:

*   If the configuration object is truly static and never changes after initial loading, `markRaw` is the best choice for optimal performance.
*   If you only need to react to changes in top-level properties like `config.features` or `config.app`, but not to changes within `config.app.theme`, `shallowReactive` is more appropriate.
*   If every change in config needs to trigger a re-render then `reactive` is the option to go with.

## Conclusion

`markRaw` and `shallowReactive` are powerful tools in Vue 3 for controlling reactivity and optimizing performance. By understanding the differences between them and when to use each, you can create more efficient and performant Vue applications, especially when dealing with external libraries, large datasets, or complex object structures.  Remember to carefully consider your reactivity requirements and choose the approach that best suits your needs.
