# Building Custom Vue.js Reactive Primitives with `shallowRef` and `customRef`

Vue.js's reactivity system is powerful and flexible.  While `ref` and `reactive` cover most common use cases, sometimes you need finer-grained control or specialized behavior. This is where `shallowRef` and `customRef` come in, allowing you to build your own custom reactive primitives. This guide will explore how to utilize these tools with practical examples to optimize performance and tailor reactivity to your specific needs.

## Understanding the Need for Custom Reactive Primitives

Vue's reactivity system automatically tracks changes to reactive objects and triggers updates to the DOM.  However, there are scenarios where the default behavior isn't ideal:

*   **Performance Optimization:**  Deeply reactive objects can trigger unnecessary updates if only a portion of the object is relevant to the UI. Shallow reactivity can prevent this overhead.
*   **Fine-grained Control:** You might want to customize when and how updates are triggered based on specific conditions.
*   **Integration with External Libraries:** Some libraries might require specific update patterns that don't align with Vue's default reactivity.
*   **Deferred Updates:**  You might need to batch updates or introduce delays to avoid performance bottlenecks.

## `shallowRef`: Shallow Reactivity

`shallowRef` creates a reactive reference that tracks only the **identity** of the value, not its properties.  This means Vue will only re-render the component if the ref's value is replaced with a completely new object (or primitive value). Changes to properties *within* the object will *not* trigger updates.

**When to Use `shallowRef`:**

*   When you're dealing with large, complex objects and only care about whether the object itself has changed (e.g., replacing a list of users, but not updating individual user properties).
*   When you are integrating with external libraries where deep reactivity is undesirable.
*   When performance is critical and deep reactivity is unnecessary.

**Example:**

```vue
<script setup>
import { shallowRef, onMounted } from 'vue';

const myObject = shallowRef({
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe',
  details: {
    age: 30,
    city: 'New York'
  }
});

function updateName() {
  myObject.value.name = 'Jane Doe'; // This will NOT trigger a re-render!
  console.log("Name changed, but component won't update!");
}

function replaceObject() {
  myObject.value = { // This WILL trigger a re-render!
    id: 2,
    name: 'Peter Pan',
    details: {
      age: 100,
      city: 'Neverland'
    }
  };
  console.log("Object replaced, component will update!");
}

onMounted(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    updateName();
  }, 1000);

  setTimeout(() => {
    replaceObject();
  }, 2000);
});
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <p>ID: {{ myObject.value.id }}</p>
    <p>Name: {{ myObject.value.name }}</p>
    <p>City: {{ myObject.value.details.city }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

In this example, `updateName` modifies a property *within* the `myObject.value`, but it *doesn't* trigger a re-render. The component only re-renders when `replaceObject` assigns a *new* object to `myObject.value`.  This demonstrates the shallow nature of `shallowRef`.

## `customRef`: Ultimate Control Over Reactivity

`customRef` gives you the most control over reactivity. It allows you to define your own `get` and `set` functions for a ref, enabling you to:

*   **Control when reactivity is triggered.**
*   **Implement custom update logic.**
*   **Debounce or throttle updates.**
*   **Integrate with external state management systems.**

**How `customRef` Works:**

`customRef` takes a factory function as an argument.  This factory function should return an object with `get` and `set` methods:

*   **`get`:**  Returns the current value of the ref. This function is called when the ref is accessed in the template or in computed properties.
*   **`set`:**  Updates the ref's value.  This function is called when the ref is assigned a new value.  Inside the `set` function, you have full control over whether and how to trigger reactivity.

**Example: Debouncing Updates with `customRef`**

This example demonstrates how to debounce updates to a text input using `customRef`. This prevents excessive re-renders while the user is typing:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, customRef, onMounted } from 'vue';

function useDebouncedRef(value, delay) {
  let timeout;
  return customRef((track, trigger) => {
    return {
      get() {
        track(); // Track the dependency
        return value;
      },
      set(newValue) {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => {
          value = newValue;
          trigger(); // Trigger update after delay
        }, delay);
      }
    };
  });
}

const debouncedText = useDebouncedRef('', 500);
const inputText = ref('');

onMounted(() => {
    //This is just for demo purposes. In reality you should be using v-model
    inputText.value = debouncedText.value
});

</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <label for="my-input">Enter text:</label>
    <input id="my-input" type="text" v-model="inputText" @input="debouncedText = $event.target.value" />
    <p>Debounced value: {{ debouncedText }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`useDebouncedRef(value, delay)`:**  This custom hook creates a debounced ref.
2.  **`customRef((track, trigger) => { ... })`:**  The factory function takes `track` and `trigger` as arguments.
    *   **`track()`:** This *must* be called in the `get` function. It tells Vue to track this ref as a dependency. Vue knows the component needs to be re-rendered when this ref changes.
    *   **`trigger()`:** This function triggers reactivity and re-renders the component. It's called after the debouncing delay in the `set` function.
3.  **`get()`:**  Calls `track()` to establish reactivity and returns the current `value`.
4.  **`set(newValue)`:**
    *   Clears any existing timeout.
    *   Sets a new timeout that will update the `value` and call `trigger()` after the specified `delay`.
5.  **`inputText` and `debouncedText`:** We are using a regular ref to bind the input to the value, so we can see the text changing instantly as we type. We are using customRef with debouncing logic to assign a final value to the `debouncedText`. This ensures that the debounced value is updated after typing stops, and the component re-renders.

**Key Considerations When Using `customRef`:**

*   **`track()` is Mandatory:** Always call `track()` in the `get` function.  Failing to do so will prevent Vue from tracking this ref as a dependency, and the component won't re-render when the ref changes.
*   **Control Over Re-renders:** You are responsible for calling `trigger()` to trigger re-renders. Be mindful of performance and avoid unnecessary updates.
*   **Complexity:** `customRef` introduces more complexity than `ref` or `reactive`.  Use it only when you need fine-grained control over reactivity.

## Best Practices

*   **Start with `ref` or `reactive`:**  Use the simplest reactive primitives first. Only resort to `shallowRef` or `customRef` if you encounter performance issues or need custom behavior.
*   **Document Custom Refs:**  Clearly document the purpose and behavior of your custom refs to make your code easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your custom refs to ensure they behave as expected and don't introduce unexpected side effects.
*   **Profile Performance:** Use Vue Devtools to profile your application and identify areas where custom refs can improve performance.

## Conclusion

`shallowRef` and `customRef` provide powerful tools for building custom reactive primitives in Vue.js. `shallowRef` offers a simple way to optimize performance by disabling deep reactivity, while `customRef` allows for maximum control over reactivity with debouncing, throttling, and integration with external systems. By understanding these tools and their use cases, you can create more efficient and maintainable Vue.js applications. Remember to use them judiciously and prioritize simpler solutions when appropriate.
