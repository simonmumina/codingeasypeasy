# How to Customize BootstrapVue Styles: Overriding SCSS Variables

BootstrapVue is a powerful Vue.js component library that provides a wide range of pre-built UI components based on Bootstrap 4 or Bootstrap 5. However, sometimes the default styles might not perfectly align with your application's branding or desired aesthetic. Fortunately, BootstrapVue, leveraging the power of Bootstrap's SCSS architecture, allows you to easily customize its appearance by overriding SCSS variables.

This guide will walk you through the different methods to override BootstrapVue's SCSS variables, ensuring you can create a unique and visually appealing application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Vue.js project:** A Vue.js project set up. You can use Vue CLI to quickly scaffold a new project.
*   **BootstrapVue installed:** BootstrapVue is installed and configured within your Vue.js project.  Refer to the official [BootstrapVue documentation](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/) for installation instructions.
*   **SCSS support:**  Your project should be configured to handle SCSS files. This often involves using `vue-cli-service` with the appropriate loaders. If you're using Vue CLI, you likely already have SCSS support.

## Understanding SCSS Variables in BootstrapVue

BootstrapVue's components are styled using Bootstrap's SCSS variables. These variables control various aspects of the components' appearance, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and sizes. By overriding these variables, you can effectively change the default styles of BootstrapVue components.

You can find a comprehensive list of all Bootstrap SCSS variables in the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/theming/) (for Bootstrap 4) or [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/sass/) (for Bootstrap 5). BootstrapVue mostly uses these variables, although there are some BootstrapVue-specific variables in some components which you can explore through BootstrapVue source code.

## Methods to Override SCSS Variables

There are several ways to override BootstrapVue SCSS variables, each with its own advantages and considerations. Let's explore the most common and effective methods:

### 1. Using a Custom SCSS File

This is the most common and recommended approach.  You create a custom SCSS file where you redefine the BootstrapVue SCSS variables *before* importing BootstrapVue's SCSS. This ensures your custom values take precedence.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create a Custom SCSS File:** Create a new SCSS file, for example, `src/assets/scss/_custom.scss`. This file will contain your variable overrides.

2.  **Override Variables:**  In your custom SCSS file, redefine the Bootstrap SCSS variables you want to change.  For example, to change the primary color:

    ```scss
    // src/assets/scss/_custom.scss

    // Import Bootstrap functions first
    @import "~bootstrap/scss/functions";

    // Override Bootstrap variables here
    $primary: #007bff; // Your desired primary color

    // Override more variables as needed
    $body-bg: #f8f9fa;

    // Example modifying button size
    $btn-padding-y:   .75rem;
    $btn-padding-x:   1.5rem;
    $btn-font-size:   1.25rem;

    // Then import the rest of Bootstrap
    @import "~bootstrap/scss/variables";
    @import "~bootstrap/scss/mixins";
    ```

    **Important:**  Always import Bootstrap's `functions.scss` *before* overriding variables.  Bootstrap's components rely on these functions to calculate derived values. Additionally, consider importing `variables.scss` and `mixins.scss` *after* your overrides, so your variables are available when mixins are used.  This ensures the mixins use your custom variables.

3.  **Import the Custom SCSS File:** In your main application entry point (usually `src/main.js` or `App.vue`), import your custom SCSS file *before* importing BootstrapVue's CSS.

    **main.js:**

    ```javascript
    // src/main.js
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import App from './App.vue'
    import BootstrapVue from 'bootstrap-vue'

    import './assets/scss/_custom.scss' // Import your custom SCSS
    import 'bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css' // Import BootstrapVue CSS

    Vue.use(BootstrapVue)

    new Vue({
      render: h => h(App),
    }).$mount('#app')
    ```

    **App.vue:**

    ```vue
    // src/App.vue
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <b-button variant="primary">Primary Button</b-button>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script>
    export default {
      name: 'App'
    }
    </script>

    <style lang="scss">
    // Import your custom SCSS file. This approach is also valid.
    @import "./assets/scss/_custom.scss";
    </style>
    ```

    In your `App.vue`, you can either put the `@import` inside the `<style lang="scss">` block, or use the import statement in your `main.js` file.  Choosing depends on project structure and preference.

4.  **Verify Changes:** Run your application and verify that the BootstrapVue components now reflect your custom styles. The primary button should now be the color you defined in your `_custom.scss` file.

**Advantages:**

*   **Clean separation of concerns:** Keeps your custom styles separate from the BootstrapVue library.
*   **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update your custom styles.
*   **Overriding precedence:** Ensures your variables take precedence over BootstrapVue's defaults.

**Disadvantages:**

*   Requires SCSS processing setup (usually already in place with Vue CLI).

### 2.  Using Vue CLI's `vue.config.js` (Recommended for Vue CLI Projects)

If you're using Vue CLI, you can leverage the `vue.config.js` file to configure the SCSS loader and inject your custom variables globally.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create or Modify `vue.config.js`:**  If you don't already have a `vue.config.js` file in your project root, create one.

2.  **Configure `sass-loader`:**  Add the following configuration to `vue.config.js`:

    ```javascript
    // vue.config.js
    const { defineConfig } = require('@vue/cli-service')
    module.exports = defineConfig({
      transpileDependencies: true,
      css: {
        loaderOptions: {
          scss: {
            additionalData: `@import "@/assets/scss/_custom.scss";`,
          },
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    Replace `@import "@/assets/scss/_custom.scss";` with the correct path to your custom SCSS file.

    **Explanation:**

    *   `css.loaderOptions.scss.additionalData`: This option allows you to inject SCSS code into every SCSS file processed by Vue CLI.  By importing your `_custom.scss` file here, you ensure that your variable overrides are available globally.

3.  **Create Custom SCSS File (same as before):** Create `src/assets/scss/_custom.scss` and define your variable overrides, remembering to import `functions.scss` first.

    ```scss
    // src/assets/scss/_custom.scss

    @import "~bootstrap/scss/functions";

    $primary: #007bff;
    $body-bg: #f8f9fa;
    ```

4.  **Restart the Development Server:**  Restart your Vue CLI development server to apply the changes.

**Advantages:**

*   **Global scope:**  Variables are available in all components without needing to import the custom SCSS file in each component.
*   **Convenient for Vue CLI users:** Integrates directly with Vue CLI's configuration.
*   **Cleaner code:** Reduces the need for repetitive imports in individual components.

**Disadvantages:**

*   Requires using Vue CLI.
*   Might be less explicit, making it harder to track where styles are coming from if you're not careful.

### 3. Inline Styles (Not Recommended)

While you can override styles directly within a component's `<style>` tag, this is generally **not recommended** for overriding BootstrapVue SCSS variables.  It's less maintainable and can lead to style conflicts.  However, for quick and dirty tweaks, it's *possible*.

**Example:**

```vue
<template>
  <b-button variant="primary">Primary Button</b-button>
</template>

<style lang="scss" scoped>
@import "~bootstrap/scss/functions";
$primary: #007bff; // Overriding here is generally bad practice!
@import "~bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "~bootstrap/scss/mixins";

.btn-primary {
    background-color: $primary; // Need to redeclare relevant styles due to scope!
    border-color: $primary;
}
</style>
```

**Why it's not recommended:**

*   **Scope limitations:** Styles are scoped to the component, making it difficult to apply global theme changes.
*   **Maintenance:** Hard to manage and update styles across multiple components.
*   **Specificity conflicts:**  Inline styles can be overridden by other styles, leading to unexpected behavior.
*   You will have to manually redeclare component style. This is because overriding a Bootstrap variable doesn't automatically update the component's styles, you have to find the CSS rules that depend on the variable and redefine those rules with the new variable's value. This makes the code complex and less maintainable.

### 4. CSS Variables (CSS Custom Properties)

While Bootstrap leverages SCSS variables during the build process, CSS variables (also known as CSS Custom Properties) can be used for runtime theming.  This allows you to dynamically change the look and feel of your application without recompiling your SCSS. However, BootstrapVue may not be fully compatible with them in all cases. Also, you would still have to manually redeclare styles that use CSS variable, same reason as above.

**Example (Illustrative - may require adjustments):**

1.  **Define CSS Variables in `_custom.scss`:**

    ```scss
    // src/assets/scss/_custom.scss

    :root {
      --primary-color: #007bff;
      --body-background: #f8f9fa;
    }
    ```

2.  **Use CSS Variables in CSS Rules (and update component styles):**

    ```vue
    <template>
      <b-button variant="primary">Primary Button</b-button>
    </template>

    <style lang="scss" scoped>
    .btn-primary {
        background-color: var(--primary-color);
        border-color: var(--primary-color);
    }
    body {
      background-color: var(--body-background);
    }

    </style>
    ```

3.  **Update CSS Variables with JavaScript:**

    ```javascript
    // In your component's script
    methods: {
      changeTheme() {
        document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--primary-color', '#ff0000'); // Red!
      }
    }
    ```

**Caveats:**

*   BootstrapVue's components are often styled using SCSS variables, which are compiled into static CSS.  Changing CSS variables at runtime *might not* affect all BootstrapVue styles, especially those that are not directly tied to CSS variables.  You might need to override more specific CSS rules.
*   Requires a more manual approach to styling, as you'll need to identify which CSS properties to target.
*   Older browsers might not fully support CSS variables.  Use a polyfill if necessary.

## Best Practices for Overriding BootstrapVue Styles

*   **Start with the recommended methods:**  Using a custom SCSS file or `vue.config.js` is generally the best approach.
*   **Import `functions.scss` first:** Ensure that Bootstrap's `functions.scss` file is imported *before* your variable overrides.
*   **Inspect the BootstrapVue CSS:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS rules applied to BootstrapVue components.  This will help you identify the variables and styles you need to override.
*   **Avoid excessive overrides:** Only override the variables and styles that are necessary to achieve your desired look and feel.  Overriding too much can make your application harder to maintain and update.
*   **Use descriptive variable names:**  Choose variable names that clearly indicate their purpose.
*   **Document your changes:**  Add comments to your SCSS files to explain why you are overriding specific variables and styles.
*   **Test thoroughly:**  Test your application thoroughly after making changes to ensure that your custom styles are applied correctly and that no unexpected issues arise.
*   **Upgrade Bootstrap/BootstrapVue carefully:** Always check for breaking changes with style variables when upgrading versions of Bootstrap or BootstrapVue.
