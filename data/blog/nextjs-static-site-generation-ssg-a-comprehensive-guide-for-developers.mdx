# Next.js Static Site Generation (SSG): A Comprehensive Guide for Developers

Static Site Generation (SSG) is a powerful technique for building fast, secure, and SEO-friendly websites. Next.js, a popular React framework, makes SSG incredibly easy to implement. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about SSG with Next.js, from the fundamentals to more advanced concepts.

## What is Static Site Generation (SSG)?

Unlike traditional server-side rendering (SSR) or client-side rendering (CSR), SSG pre-renders HTML pages at build time. This means that when a user requests a page, the server simply serves a pre-built HTML file, without needing to execute any JavaScript on the server or in the browser to render the initial content.

**Benefits of SSG:**

- **Performance:** SSG sites are incredibly fast because the browser receives a fully rendered HTML page almost instantly. This leads to a better user experience and improved search engine rankings.
- **SEO:** Search engines can easily crawl and index pre-rendered HTML, resulting in better search engine optimization (SEO).
- **Security:** With no server-side logic, SSG sites are less vulnerable to security threats.
- **Scalability:** Serving static files is much more efficient than dynamically rendering pages, making SSG sites highly scalable.
- **Reduced Cost:** Deploying static sites is often cheaper as you can leverage CDNs for content delivery.

## When to Use Static Site Generation

SSG is an excellent choice for websites with content that doesn't change frequently, such as:

- Blogs
- Documentation sites
- Marketing websites
- Portfolios

If your content is highly dynamic and requires frequent updates, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) might be more suitable options. We will touch on ISR later.

## Getting Started with Next.js and SSG

Let's dive into how to use SSG with Next.js. First, make sure you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed.

1.  **Create a new Next.js project:**

    ```plaintext
    npx create-next-app my-ssg-app
    cd my-ssg-app
    ```

2.  **Basic SSG with `getStaticProps`:**

    The core of SSG in Next.js is the `getStaticProps` function. This function allows you to fetch data at build time and pass it as props to your page component.

    Create a file named `pages/index.js` and add the following code:

    ```plaintext
    // pages/index.js
    function HomePage({ posts }) {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome to My Blog!</h1>
          <ul>
            {posts.map((post) => (
              <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export async function getStaticProps() {
      // Simulate fetching data from an API or database
      const posts = [
        { id: 1, title: 'My First Post' },
        { id: 2, title: 'My Second Post' },
        { id: 3, title: 'My Third Post' },
      ]

      return {
        props: {
          posts,
        },
      }
    }

    export default HomePage
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - The `HomePage` component receives the `posts` as props.
    - The `getStaticProps` function fetches the `posts` data. **Crucially, this function runs only at build time, not on the client or server during runtime.**
    - The `return` statement in `getStaticProps` _must_ include a `props` key, which is an object containing the data you want to pass to your component.

3.  **Build and Run:**

    Run the following commands in your terminal:

    ```plaintext
    npm run build
    npm run start
    ```

    Now, visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see your blog posts. If you inspect the source code of the page, you'll see that the HTML is already fully rendered.

## Dynamic Routes with `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`

For blog posts or any content with dynamic URLs, you need to use both `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.

1.  **Create a `pages/posts/[id].js` file:**

    ```plaintext
    // pages/posts/[id].js
    function Post({ post }) {
      if (!post) {
        return <div>Post not found</div>
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{post.title}</h1>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      // Simulate fetching a list of post IDs
      const posts = [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }, { id: '3' }]

      const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
        params: { id: post.id },
      }))

      return {
        paths,
        fallback: false, // or 'blocking' or true (see below)
      }
    }

    export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
      const { id } = params

      // Simulate fetching post data based on the ID
      const postsData = {
        1: { id: '1', title: 'My First Post', content: 'This is the content of my first post.' },
        2: { id: '2', title: 'My Second Post', content: 'This is the content of my second post.' },
        3: { id: '3', title: 'My Third Post', content: 'This is the content of my third post.' },
      }
      const post = postsData[id] || null

      return {
        props: {
          post,
        },
      }
    }

    export default Post
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - **`getStaticPaths`:** This function defines which paths should be statically generated. It returns an object with a `paths` array and a `fallback` property.
      - The `paths` array contains an array of objects, each representing a possible route. The `params` property within each object specifies the dynamic route parameters (in this case, `id`).
      - The `fallback` property determines what happens when a user requests a route that hasn't been statically generated at build time. Possible values are:
        - `false`: Returns a 404 error for any route not in the `paths` array. This is generally the safest option.
        - `true`: Next.js will serve a fallback page while it generates the static page in the background. The user will see the fully rendered page on subsequent requests.
        - `'blocking'`: Like `true`, but the user will wait for the page to be generated before seeing anything. Good for UX when you want to ensure content is always there, but it takes a performance hit on the first request.
    - **`getStaticProps`:** This function fetches the data for a specific post based on the `id` parameter.
      - The `params` object contains the route parameters extracted from the URL. In this case, it contains the `id` of the post.

2.  **Build and Run:**

    Run the following commands again:

    ```plaintext
    npm run build
    npm run start
    ```

    Now, visit `http://localhost:3000/posts/1`, `http://localhost:3000/posts/2`, and `http://localhost:3000/posts/3` in your browser. You should see the corresponding posts. Visiting any other URL under `/posts/` will result in a 404 error (because `fallback` is set to `false`).

## Fetching Data from External Sources

In real-world scenarios, you'll likely fetch data from an API, database, or CMS. Here's an example of fetching data from a simple JSON placeholder API:

```plaintext
// pages/posts/[id].js
async function fetchPost(id) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${id}`)
  const data = await res.json()
  return data
}

function Post({ post }) {
  if (!post) {
    return <div>Post not found</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.body}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`)
  const posts = await res.json()

  const paths = posts.slice(0, 10).map((post) => ({
    // Limit the number of statically generated pages for demonstration
    params: { id: post.id.toString() },
  }))

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { id } = params
  const post = await fetchPost(id)

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  }
}

export default Post
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Error Handling:** Always handle potential errors when fetching data.
- **API Rate Limits:** Be mindful of API rate limits and implement appropriate caching mechanisms.

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

While SSG is great for static content, it can be challenging to update content frequently. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update static pages _after_ they've been built.

To enable ISR, add the `revalidate` property to your `getStaticProps` function:

```plaintext
// pages/posts/[id].js

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { id } = params
  const post = await fetchPost(id)

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
    revalidate: 10, // Re-generate the page every 10 seconds
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `revalidate` property specifies the number of seconds after which Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page in the background when a user requests it.
- The first request after the revalidation interval will serve the stale (cached) version of the page.
- Next.js will then regenerate the page in the background, and subsequent requests will receive the updated version.

ISR strikes a balance between the performance benefits of SSG and the flexibility of dynamic updates.

## Advanced Techniques

- **Using a CMS:** Integrate with a headless CMS like Contentful, Sanity.io, or Strapi for content management.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to improve performance and reduce API calls. Next.js automatically caches the results of `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.
- **Image Optimization:** Use the `next/image` component for optimized image delivery.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely manage environment variables using `.env.local` files and the `process.env` object.

## Conclusion

Next.js SSG provides a powerful and efficient way to build performant and SEO-friendly websites. By leveraging `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`, you can statically generate your content at build time, resulting in faster load times and improved user experience. Combining SSG with ISR allows for dynamic updates without sacrificing performance. Understanding these concepts will empower you to create exceptional web applications with Next.js.
