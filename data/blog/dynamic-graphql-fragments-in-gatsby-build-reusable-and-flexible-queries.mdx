# Dynamic GraphQL Fragments in Gatsby: Build Reusable & Flexible Queries

Gatsby is a powerful React-based framework for building static sites and applications. It leverages GraphQL to fetch data during the build process. While Gatsby provides excellent tools for data fetching, complex projects often require more advanced techniques to keep your queries DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and manageable. This is where dynamic GraphQL fragments come in. This blog post will guide you through the process of creating and using dynamic GraphQL fragments in your Gatsby project.

## What are GraphQL Fragments?

Before diving into the "dynamic" part, let's understand what GraphQL fragments are. A GraphQL fragment is a reusable unit of query logic that allows you to specify a set of fields to be fetched for a particular type. Think of it as a mini-query that can be included in other queries. They promote code reuse and make your GraphQL queries more readable.

**Example (Static Fragment):**

```plaintext
fragment BlogPostFields on MarkdownRemark {
  id
  frontmatter {
    title
    date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
    author
    tags
  }
  fields {
    slug
  }
  excerpt(pruneLength: 160)
}

query AllBlogPosts {
  allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
    edges {
      node {
        ...BlogPostFields
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `BlogPostFields` is a fragment defined for the `MarkdownRemark` type. The `...BlogPostFields` syntax in the `AllBlogPosts` query includes all the fields defined in the fragment.

## The Need for Dynamic Fragments

Static fragments are useful, but they lack flexibility. What if you need to fetch different fields based on certain conditions? For example:

- **User Roles:** Fetch additional user profile information only for administrators.
- **Content Types:** Fetch different fields based on whether a node is a blog post, a page, or a product.
- **Performance Optimization:** Fetch only the necessary fields for a specific component to improve performance.
- **A/B testing:** Experiment fetching different data and based on which version the visitor sees, fetch the appropriate fragment.

This is where dynamic GraphQL fragments become invaluable. They allow you to generate fragments programmatically, based on variables or conditions.

## Implementing Dynamic GraphQL Fragments in Gatsby

Here's how you can implement dynamic GraphQL fragments in your Gatsby project:

**1. Creating a Helper Function:**

First, you'll create a helper function that generates the fragment based on your desired logic. This function will typically take some input parameters and return a string containing the GraphQL fragment definition.

```plaintext
// src/utils/graphql-fragments.js

export const createBlogPostFragment = (includeContent = false) => {
  let fragment = `
    fragment BlogPostFields on MarkdownRemark {
      id
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
        author
        tags
      }
      fields {
        slug
      }
      excerpt(pruneLength: 160)
  `;

  if (includeContent) {
    fragment += `
      html
    `;
  }

  fragment += `
    }
  `;

  return fragment;
};
```

In this example, `createBlogPostFragment` takes a boolean `includeContent` as input. If `includeContent` is true, the `html` field (containing the entire post content) is included in the fragment.

**2. Using the Dynamic Fragment in your GraphQL Query:**

Now, import and use the helper function in your Gatsby page or component. You'll need to use Gatsby's `graphql` template literal tag to define your query. Make sure to use template literal syntax (backticks) and properly escape any variables you inject.

```plaintext
// src/pages/index.js

import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { createBlogPostFragment } from '../utils/graphql-fragments'

const IndexPage = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      {data.allMarkdownRemark.edges.map(({ node }) => (
        <div key={node.id}>
          <h2>{node.frontmatter.title}</h2>
          <p>{node.excerpt}</p>
          <a href={node.fields.slug}>Read More</a>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query AllBlogPosts($includeContent: Boolean!) {
    allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
      edges {
        node {
          ...BlogPostFields
        }
      }
    }
    ${createBlogPostFragment(true)} # Always include full content for the index.
  }
`

export default IndexPage
```

**Explanation:**

- **Import the Helper:** `import { createBlogPostFragment } from '../utils/graphql-fragments';` imports the function you created earlier.
- **`graphql` Tag:** The `graphql` tag from Gatsby is used to define the GraphQL query.
- **Template Literal:** Note that the entire query is defined using backticks (` `` `). This is crucial for template literal syntax.
- **Fragment Inclusion:** `${createBlogPostFragment(true)}` invokes the helper function with the `includeContent` argument set to `true`, generating the fragment dynamically. This adds the `html` field to each node in the index page.
- **Variables in Query**: Note the inclusion of `$includeContent: Boolean!` in the query and its use in the createBlogPostFragment function, now the query needs to send a `includeContent` variable during execution.

**3. Conditional Rendering with Dynamic Fragments based on variable**:

Now, lets enhance the usage of fragments so that it reacts to the query variable given during execution.

```plaintext
// src/templates/blog-post.js

import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { createBlogPostFragment } from '../utils/graphql-fragments'

const BlogPostTemplate = ({ data }) => {
  const { markdownRemark } = data
  const { frontmatter, html } = markdownRemark

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <p>{frontmatter.date}</p>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
    </div>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query BlogPostBySlug($slug: String!, $includeContent: Boolean!) {
    markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      ...BlogPostFields
    }
    ${createBlogPostFragment(true)}  # Include html for blog post pages
  }
`

export default BlogPostTemplate
```

This example includes the `html` field in the blog post page using the previously created fragment. This ensures you have access to the full content.

**4. Passing Variables:**

Now that the `includeContent` variable is available, you can use gatsby to provide its value to the query. You would need to pass `context` variable with the respective Boolean `true` or `false`. Lets look at gatsby-node.js file.

```plaintext
// gatsby-node.js

const path = require('path');

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions;

  const blogPostTemplate = path.resolve('./src/templates/blog-post.js');

  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) {
        edges {
          node {
            fields {
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  if (result.errors) {
    throw result.errors;
  }

  const posts = result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;

  posts.forEach((post, index) => {
    const previous = index === posts.length - 1 ? null : posts[index + 1].node;
    const next = index === 0 ? null : posts[index - 1].node;

    createPage({
      path: post.node.fields.slug,
      component: blogPostTemplate,
      context: {
        slug: post.node.fields.slug,
        includeContent: true, // Pass true to include content
      },
    });
  });
};
```

This is the standard `gatsby-node.js` code used in gatsby projects to generate pages for blog post. Notice the line `includeContent: true`. It makes sure that the value `true` is provided as the value for `$includeContent` in `BlogPostBySlug` graphql query. If the requirement changes so that content needs to be excluded then, the value can be changed to `false`. This reduces any re-deployment required when the content can be toggled remotely without a new deployment.

## Benefits of Dynamic Fragments

- **Code Reusability:** Avoid duplicating GraphQL queries across your components.
- **Maintainability:** Easily update fragments in one place and have the changes reflected throughout your application.
- **Flexibility:** Adapt your queries based on dynamic conditions, user roles, or content types.
- **Performance:** Fetch only the necessary data for each component, improving load times.
- **Readability:** Complex queries become more manageable with well-defined fragments.

## Advanced Techniques

- **Nested Fragments:** Create fragments that include other fragments.
- **Fragment Spread Operators:** Use the `...` spread operator to include multiple fragments in a single query.
- **GraphQL Directives:** Use directives like `@include` and `@skip` to conditionally include or exclude fields in your fragments directly within the GraphQL query.

## Conclusion

Dynamic GraphQL fragments are a powerful tool for building scalable and maintainable Gatsby applications. By leveraging these techniques, you can write cleaner, more efficient code and optimize your site's performance. Experiment with different scenarios and tailor your dynamic fragments to meet the specific needs of your project. Remember to consider performance implications when including large fields conditionally. Happy coding!
