# Mastering Nitro Server Routes in Nuxt 3: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Nuxt 3, built on top of Vue.js and Vite, offers a powerful and flexible development experience. One of its key strengths lies in its seamless integration with Nitro, a hybrid server engine that enables you to build server-side functionalities directly within your Nuxt application. This blog post dives deep into Nitro server routes, exploring how to create, use, and optimize them for building robust and scalable backend APIs for your Nuxt 3 projects.

## What are Nitro Server Routes?

Nitro server routes are essentially serverless functions that you define within your Nuxt 3 project. They allow you to handle HTTP requests, interact with databases, access environment variables, and perform any other server-side logic required by your application. These routes are automatically deployed and managed by Nitro, making it incredibly easy to build backend functionality without needing a separate backend server.

Think of them as tiny, self-contained API endpoints living right inside your Nuxt project.

## Why Use Nitro Server Routes?

Using Nitro server routes offers several compelling advantages:

- **Simplified Development:** No need to manage a separate backend server or API gateway. All your logic resides within your Nuxt project, making development and deployment much simpler.
- **Performance Optimization:** Nitro provides automatic code splitting and dynamic imports, leading to optimized bundle sizes and faster execution times.
- **Scalability:** Nitro is designed for scalability. Server routes are automatically deployed as serverless functions, which can scale on demand to handle varying traffic loads.
- **Security:** By handling sensitive logic on the server, you can protect your client-side code and prevent exposing API keys or database credentials.
- **Full-Stack Capabilities:** Nuxt 3 with Nitro provides a true full-stack development experience, allowing you to build both the front-end and back-end of your application within a single codebase.
- **Hot Reloading:** Nitro supports hot reloading, meaning that any changes you make to your server routes are automatically reflected in the browser without requiring a full server restart. This significantly speeds up development.

## Creating Your First Nitro Server Route

Let's start by creating a simple "Hello World" server route. In your Nuxt 3 project, create a `server/api` directory (if it doesn't already exist). Inside this directory, create a file named `hello.ts`:

```plaintext
// server/api/hello.ts
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  return {
    message: 'Hello, Nitro!',
  }
})
```

That's it! Nuxt automatically detects this file and creates a route at `/api/hello`. You can now access this route in your browser or using `fetch` in your Nuxt components.

Let's break down this code:

- **`server/api/hello.ts`**: This defines the route's endpoint as `/api/hello`. Nuxt uses a file-based routing system for server routes. The filename directly corresponds to the route path.
- **`defineEventHandler`**: This is a helper function provided by Nuxt for defining event handlers. It provides type safety and ensures that the handler is properly integrated with Nitro.
- **`event`**: This object contains information about the incoming request, such as headers, query parameters, and body.
- **`return { message: 'Hello, Nitro!' }`**: This returns a JSON object as the response to the request. Nitro automatically handles serializing the object to JSON.

## Accessing Query Parameters

Server routes often need to access query parameters passed in the URL. Here's how you can do that:

```plaintext
// server/api/greet.ts
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const name = getQuery(event).name || 'Guest'
  return {
    message: `Hello, ${name}!`,
  }
})
```

Now, if you access `/api/greet?name=John`, you'll get the response:

```plaintext
{
  "message": "Hello, John!"
}
```

If you access `/api/greet` without the `name` parameter, you'll get:

```plaintext
{
  "message": "Hello, Guest!"
}
```

The `getQuery(event)` function retrieves all query parameters from the request URL as an object. You can then access specific parameters by their name. The `|| 'Guest'` part is a default value that's used if the `name` parameter is not provided.

## Handling POST Requests and Request Bodies

Server routes can also handle POST requests and access the request body. Here's an example:

```plaintext
// server/api/submit.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const body = await readBody(event)

  // Perform some operation with the data, e.g., save to a database
  console.log('Received data:', body)

  return {
    message: 'Data received successfully!',
  }
})
```

In this example:

- **`readBody(event)`**: This function reads the request body and parses it as JSON. Make sure the client sends the data with the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
- **`await`**: `readBody` is an asynchronous function, so you need to use `await` to wait for the body to be parsed.
- **`body`**: This variable contains the parsed JSON data from the request body. You can then access properties within the `body` object and use them in your server-side logic.

To test this, you can use `fetch` in your Nuxt component or a tool like `curl` or `Postman`:

```plaintext
// Example using fetch in a Nuxt component
async function submitData() {
  const data = { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' }

  const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  })

  const result = await response.json()
  console.log(result) // Output: { message: 'Data received successfully!' }
}
```

## Accessing Environment Variables

It's crucial to avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys or database passwords directly into your code. Instead, you should use environment variables. Nuxt provides a straightforward way to access these variables within your server routes:

```plaintext
// server/api/config.ts
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY // Access the API_KEY environment variable
  return {
    apiKey: apiKey || 'API key not set',
  }
})
```

To define environment variables, you can use a `.env` file in your project's root directory or set them directly in your deployment environment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

**Important:** By default, environment variables are only accessible on the server-side. If you need to expose some environment variables to the client-side, you need to configure them in your `nuxt.config.ts` file using the `runtimeConfig` option.

```plaintext
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    // Private keys are only available on the server
    apiSecret: '123',

    // Public keys that are exposed to the client
    public: {
      apiUrl: '/api',
    },
  },
})
```

Then you can access these variables in your server routes like this:

```plaintext
// server/api/example.ts
import { useRuntimeConfig } from '#imports'

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const config = useRuntimeConfig()
  return {
    apiSecret: config.apiSecret,
    apiUrl: config.public.apiUrl,
  }
})
```

And in your client-side components like this:

```plaintext
<script setup>
const runtimeConfig = useRuntimeConfig()

console.log(runtimeConfig.public.apiUrl)
</script>
```

## Interacting with Databases

Nitro server routes can interact with databases to persist and retrieve data. Here's a simplified example using Prisma, a popular ORM:

1.  **Install Prisma:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install @prisma/client prisma --save-dev
    npx prisma init
    ```

2.  **Configure Prisma:** Edit your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to define your database schema. For example:

    ```prisma
    generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
    }

    datasource db {
      provider = "sqlite"
      url      = "file:./dev.db" // Use a SQLite database for development
    }

    model Post {
      id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      title     String
      content   String?
      published Boolean  @default(false)
    }
    ```

3.  **Generate Prisma Client:**

    ```plaintext
    npx prisma generate
    ```

4.  **Create a Server Route:**

    ```plaintext
    // server/api/posts.ts
    import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

    const prisma = new PrismaClient()

    export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
      const posts = await prisma.post.findMany()
      return posts
    })
    ```

This code fetches all posts from the database and returns them as a JSON array. You can then access this data from your Nuxt components. Remember to handle database connection errors and implement proper error handling in your production code. Also, consider using a connection pool for more efficient database access.

**Important:** Remember to configure your database connection details (e.g., connection string) using environment variables for security and portability.

## Advanced Routing

Nitro offers more advanced routing features:

- **Dynamic Routes:** Create routes with parameters that can be accessed in the event handler. For example, `server/api/users/[id].ts` will match routes like `/api/users/123` and `/api/users/456`. You can access the `id` parameter using `event.context.params.id`.

  ```plaintext
  // server/api/users/[id].ts
  export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
    const userId = event.context.params.id
    return {
      message: `User ID: ${userId}`,
    }
  })
  ```

- **Middleware:** Define middleware functions that run before or after your server routes. Middleware can be used for authentication, authorization, logging, and other common tasks. Create a file in `server/middleware/` directory.

  ```plaintext
  // server/middleware/auth.ts
  export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
    // Example: Check for an authentication token
    const token = getRequestHeader(event, 'authorization')
    if (!token) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 401,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized',
      })
    }

    // Optionally, verify the token and set user information on the event context
    // event.context.user = { id: 123, name: 'John Doe' };
  })
  ```

  This middleware will be automatically applied to all routes. You can apply middleware to specific routes by using the `use` option in your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

- **Error Handling:** Nitro provides a built-in error handling mechanism. You can throw errors from your server routes using `createError`. Nitro will automatically handle the error and return an appropriate response to the client. You can customize the error handling behavior by creating a `server/error.ts` file.

  ```plaintext
  // server/error.ts
  import { defineEventHandler } from 'h3'

  export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    const error = event.error
    // Log the error, send to monitoring service, etc.
    console.error(error)

    return {
      statusCode: error.statusCode || 500,
      message: error.message || 'Internal Server Error',
    }
  })
  ```

## Best Practices for Nitro Server Routes

- **Keep Routes Focused:** Each server route should have a clear and specific purpose. Avoid creating overly complex routes that handle multiple responsibilities.
- **Use Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations like database queries or API calls to avoid blocking the event loop.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement proper error handling to prevent unexpected crashes and provide informative error messages to the client.
- **Validate Input:** Validate incoming data to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
- **Use Caching:** Cache frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce database load.
- **Secure Your API:** Implement authentication and authorization to protect your API from unauthorized access.
- **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that your server routes only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks. Avoid granting excessive privileges that could be exploited.
- **Use TypeScript:** Leveraging TypeScript provides type safety and helps catch errors early in the development process.
- **Logging:** Implement logging to track requests, errors, and other important events. This will help you debug issues and monitor the performance of your server routes.
