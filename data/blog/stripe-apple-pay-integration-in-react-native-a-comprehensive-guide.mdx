# Stripe Apple Pay Integration in React Native: A Comprehensive Guide

Accepting payments in your React Native app is crucial for many mobile applications, especially those involved in e-commerce or offering premium services. Apple Pay provides a seamless and secure way for iOS users to make purchases directly within your app. Combining Apple Pay with Stripe's powerful payment processing capabilities offers a robust and reliable solution. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Stripe Apple Pay into your React Native application, complete with detailed code examples.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have the following set up:

- **A Stripe Account:** If you don't have one already, sign up for a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com). Ensure you have access to your API keys (both test and live).
- **React Native Development Environment:** You should have a working React Native development environment configured with Node.js, npm/yarn, and Xcode (for iOS).
- **Expo (Optional but Recommended):** While you can use React Native CLI, Expo simplifies many aspects of development, particularly during initial setup. This guide will primarily focus on Expo but will highlight key differences for React Native CLI users.
- **Apple Developer Account:** You'll need an active Apple Developer account to configure Apple Pay entitlements and certificates.
- **Physical iOS Device:** While simulators can be useful for initial development, testing Apple Pay _requires_ a physical iOS device with Apple Pay enabled. The simulator can sometimes "pretend" to work, but real transaction flows require a device.

## Step 1: Installing the Necessary Packages

We'll primarily be using the `@stripe/stripe-react-native` library, which provides the necessary components and functionalities for integrating Stripe with React Native.

```plaintext
# Using npm
npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native

# Using yarn
yarn add @stripe/stripe-react-native
```

## Step 2: Configuring your Stripe Account for Apple Pay

1.  **Domain Verification:** In your Stripe dashboard, go to Settings -> Payment Methods and enable Apple Pay. You'll need to verify your domain. Follow Stripe's instructions for adding a file to your website to prove domain ownership. This step ensures that your app can securely process payments.
2.  **Adding your App as a Merchant:** Register your React Native app as a merchant on your Stripe dashboard. This typically involves adding your app's bundle identifier. Navigate to Settings -> Apple Pay -> Register Merchant. Follow the instructions, providing your app's identifier.

## Step 3: Setting up your iOS Project

This step involves configuring your Xcode project to enable Apple Pay.

1.  **Enabling Apple Pay Capability:** Open your project in Xcode. Select your target (your app) and navigate to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. Click the "+ Capability" button and search for "Apple Pay". Add the Apple Pay capability.

2.  **Adding Merchant Identifiers:** In the "Apple Pay" capability settings, click the "+" button to add your merchant identifiers. These identifiers should match the ones you registered in your Stripe dashboard. The format is typically: `merchant.com.yourdomain.yourappname`. **Important:** Double-check that these identifiers are exactly the same as those in your Stripe dashboard. Typos are a common cause of Apple Pay failures.

3.  **Entitlements File:** Xcode may automatically create an `entitlements.plist` file. Ensure it contains the Apple Pay entitlement with your merchant identifiers. If it doesn't exist, Xcode will prompt you to create one when you enable the capability.

4.  **Expo specific note**: If you are using Expo, you need to configure the `app.json` file. Specifically, use the `expo build:ios` command and download the provisioning profile that is created. Also, configure the `appleId` and `appleTeamId` in the `app.json` file under the `ios` section. Add also the `entitlements` key in the `app.json` file under the `ios` section and include the Apple Pay capability. You need to rebuild the native app after these changes.

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourdomain.yourappname",
      "appleId": "your_apple_id",
      "appleTeamId": "your_apple_team_id",
      "entitlements": {
        "com.apple.developer.in-app-payments": ["merchant.com.yourdomain.yourappname"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Implementing the React Native Code

Now, let's write the React Native code to integrate Apple Pay.

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, Button, Alert, Platform } from 'react-native'
import {
  initStripe,
  useStripe,
  ApplePayButton,
  PaymentSheet,
  usePaymentSheet,
} from '@stripe/stripe-react-native'

const App = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [applePayAvailable, setApplePayAvailable] = useState(false) // New State
  const { initPaymentSheet, presentPaymentSheet, confirmPaymentSheetPayment } = usePaymentSheet()
  const { isApplePaySupported, presentApplePay, confirmApplePayPayment } = useStripe()

  const initialize = async () => {
    const { error, paymentIntent } = await fetch('YOUR_BACKEND_ENDPOINT/create-payment-intent', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: 1099, // Amount in cents
        currency: 'usd',
      }),
    }).then((r) => r.json())

    if (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error creating payment intent:', error.message)
      return
    }
    return paymentIntent
  }

  const fetchPaymentParams = async () => {
    try {
      const paymentIntent = await initialize()

      if (!paymentIntent) {
        return
      }
      const { error } = await initPaymentSheet({
        paymentIntentClientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret,
        merchantDisplayName: 'Your App Name', // Your App Name
        allowsDelayedPaymentMethods: true,
        style: 'automatic',
        applePay: {
          merchantCountryCode: 'US', // Replace with your merchant country code
        },
      })

      if (error) {
        Alert.alert('Error initializing Payment Sheet', error.message)
      }
    } catch (e) {
      Alert.alert('fetchPaymentParams catch error:', e.message)
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const initStripeAsync = async () => {
      try {
        initStripe({
          publishableKey: 'YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY', // Replace with your publishable key
          merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.com.yourdomain.yourappname', // Replace with your merchant identifier
          urlScheme: 'yourappname',
        })
        if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
          const applePaySupport = await isApplePaySupported()
          setApplePayAvailable(applePaySupport)
        } else {
          setApplePayAvailable(false) // Apple Pay is only for iOS
        }
      } catch (e) {
        Alert.alert('initStripe catch error:', e.message)
      }
    }

    initStripeAsync()
    fetchPaymentParams()
  }, [])

  const handleApplePayPress = async () => {
    setLoading(true)
    try {
      const { error: paymentError } = await presentPaymentSheet()

      if (paymentError) {
        Alert.alert(`Error presenting Apple Pay: ${paymentError.message}`)
        setLoading(false)
        return
      }

      const { error: confirmError } = await confirmPaymentSheetPayment()
      if (confirmError) {
        Alert.alert(`Error confirming payment: ${confirmError.message}`)
        setLoading(false)
        return
      }

      Alert.alert('Payment complete!')
    } catch (e) {
      Alert.alert(`Error in handleApplePayPress: ${e.message}`)
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      {Platform.OS === 'ios' && applePayAvailable ? (
        <Button title="Pay with Apple Pay" onPress={handleApplePayPress} disabled={loading} />
      ) : (
        <Text>Apple Pay not available on this device or platform.</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

export default App
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Necessary Modules:** Imports required components from `react-native` and `@stripe/stripe-react-native`.
2.  **`initStripe`:** Initializes the Stripe SDK with your publishable key and merchant identifier. **Crucially, ensure `merchantIdentifier` matches your configured merchant identifier in Xcode and Stripe dashboard.** Also set the `urlScheme` so that stripe sdk can properly handle redirect back to the app.
3.  **`isApplePaySupported`:** This method is important! The component will render only if Apple pay is supported by device, is configured correctly, and is enabled.
4.  **`fetchPaymentParams`:** In this function we create the payment intent on the backend, and then we initialize the payment sheet on the frontend with all the applePay parameters to create the applePay payment.
5.  **`presentPaymentSheet`:** Presents the Apple Pay sheet to the user.
6.  **`confirmPaymentSheetPayment`:** Confirms the payment after the user approves it on the Apple Pay sheet.
7.  **Rendering the Apple Pay Button:** Conditionally renders the `ApplePayButton` only if Apple Pay is available on the platform (iOS) and `applePayAvailable` is true.

## Step 5: Backend Integration (Important!)

The React Native code above interacts with a backend endpoint (`YOUR_BACKEND_ENDPOINT/create-payment-intent`). You _must_ create this backend endpoint using a server-side language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP) and the Stripe server-side SDK. This endpoint is responsible for:

1.  **Creating a Payment Intent:** Using your Stripe secret key, create a Payment Intent with the desired amount, currency, and other relevant details.
2.  **Returning the Client Secret:** Return the `client_secret` from the Payment Intent to your React Native app. This secret is essential for confirming the payment on the client-side.

**Example Node.js Backend:**

```plaintext
const stripe = require('stripe')('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY') // Replace with your secret key
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
app.use(express.json())

app.post('/create-payment-intent', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { amount, currency } = req.body

    // Create a Payment Intent
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount: amount,
      currency: currency,
      automatic_payment_methods: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    })

    res.json({ client_secret: paymentIntent.client_secret, paymentIntent: paymentIntent })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message })
  }
})

app.listen(4242, () => console.log('Running on port 4242'))
```

**Important Considerations for Backend Integration:**

- **Security:** Never expose your Stripe secret key in your client-side code. Store it securely on your server.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your backend to gracefully handle unexpected issues during payment processing.
- **Idempotency:** Implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges in case of network errors or retries. Stripe provides mechanisms for this.
- **Webhook Integration (Highly Recommended):** Set up Stripe webhooks to listen for payment-related events (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.failed`). This allows you to update your database and fulfill orders asynchronously, ensuring that you don't miss any payment events.

## Step 6: Testing your Apple Pay Integration

1.  **Enable Apple Pay on your iOS Device:** Go to Settings -> Wallet & Apple Pay and add a card. You can use test cards provided by Stripe for testing purposes. Look for Stripe's documentation on test cards.
2.  **Run your React Native App on a Physical Device:** Build and run your app on a physical iOS device. Apple Pay _will not work_ on the simulator for end-to-end testing.
3.  **Click the Apple Pay Button:** Trigger the payment flow.
4.  **Authenticate with Touch ID/Face ID:** Authorize the payment using Touch ID or Face ID.
5.  **Verify the Transaction:** Check your Stripe dashboard to confirm that the payment was processed successfully. Also, check your backend logs for any errors or webhook events.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Apple Pay is not available"**: Double-check that you have:
  - Enabled Apple Pay in Xcode.
  - Added the correct merchant identifiers in Xcode and your Stripe dashboard.
  - Added a card to your Apple Wallet.
  - Are testing on a physical iOS device.
- **"Invalid Merchant Identifier"**: Verify that the merchant identifier in your React Native code, Xcode, and Stripe dashboard _exactly_ match.
- **"Payment Intent Creation Failed"**: Check your backend logs for any errors related to Payment Intent creation. Ensure that your Stripe secret key is correctly configured.
- **PaymentSheet Errors**: Review the error message and Stripe's documentation for potential solutions. The most common causes are incorrect configurations in your backend or issues with the Payment Intent.

## Conclusion

Integrating Stripe Apple Pay in React Native offers a streamlined and secure payment experience for your users. By following this comprehensive guide and carefully configuring your Stripe account and Xcode project, you can successfully implement Apple Pay in your app and start accepting payments seamlessly.
