# Best Resources to Learn Django: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners to Experts

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. If you're looking to build robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications, Django is an excellent choice. But where do you start? This comprehensive guide covers the best resources to learn Django, catering to all skill levels from complete beginners to experienced developers.

## Why Learn Django?

Before diving into the resources, let's briefly recap why Django is so popular:

- **Batteries Included:** Django provides almost everything you need out of the box, including an ORM, templating engine, form handling, and security features.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Django encourages reusable code, reducing redundancy and making your projects easier to maintain.
- **Security:** Django has built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
- **Scalability:** Django can handle high traffic websites and applications.
- **Large Community:** A vibrant and active community provides ample support, tutorials, and packages.

        # Read permissions are allowed to any request,
