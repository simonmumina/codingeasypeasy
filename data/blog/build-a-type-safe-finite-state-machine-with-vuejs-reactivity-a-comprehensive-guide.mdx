# Build a Type-Safe Finite State Machine with Vue.js Reactivity: A Comprehensive Guide

Finite State Machines (FSMs) are a powerful tool for modeling systems with a limited number of states and well-defined transitions between them. They provide a clear and predictable way to manage complex application logic, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations, user interactions, or complex workflows. This guide will walk you through building a type-safe FSM using Vue.js reactivity and TypeScript, offering a more lightweight alternative to libraries like XState for simpler use cases.

## Why Use a Finite State Machine?

Before diving into the code, let's understand the benefits of using an FSM:

- **Predictability:** FSMs ensure that your system only behaves in a predefined set of states, making debugging and reasoning about its behavior much easier.
- **Maintainability:** The explicit definition of states and transitions makes the code more organized and easier to understand, leading to improved maintainability.
- **Testability:** The clear boundaries between states and transitions simplify testing, as you can easily verify that the system behaves as expected under various conditions.
- **Visual Representation:** FSMs can be easily visualized, aiding in understanding and communicating the system's logic to others.

## Setting Up Your Vue.js Project with TypeScript

Make sure you have a Vue.js project set up with TypeScript. If you don't, you can quickly create one using the Vue CLI:

```plaintext
vue create my-fsm-app
# Select "Manually select features"
# Choose TypeScript, Vuex (optional), Router (optional) and any other features you need.
```

## Defining the State Machine

Let's imagine a simple scenario: a loading indicator. Our FSM will have three states:

- **`idle`:** The initial state, indicating that the data hasn't been loaded yet.
- **`loading`:** The state when the data is being fetched.
- **`loaded`:** The state when the data has been successfully loaded.
- **`error`:** The state when loading fails.

First, define the state types:

```plaintext
// src/types/fsm.ts
export type State = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error'

interface Context {
  data: any | null // Holds the loaded data (can be more specific based on your data structure)
  error: string | null // Holds the error message if loading fails
}

interface StateDefinition {
  onEnter?: () => void
  onExit?: () => void
}

type StateDefinitions = {
  [key in State]?: StateDefinition
}

export interface FSMConfig {
  initial: State
  states: StateDefinitions
  context: Context
  transitions: Transitions
}

export type Event =
  | { type: 'FETCH' }
  | { type: 'RESOLVE'; data: any }
  | { type: 'REJECT'; error: string }
  | { type: 'RESET' }

type TransitionTarget = State | ((context: Context) => State)

interface TransitionDefinition {
  target: TransitionTarget
  condition?: (context: Context) => boolean // Optional condition for transition
  effect?: (context: Context, event?: Event) => void // Optional side effect
}

type Transitions = {
  [key in State]?: {
    [event: string]: TransitionDefinition
  }
}
```

This defines a `State` type with our four possible states and an `Event` type that represents the possible events that can trigger transitions. We also introduce a `Context` object to hold data related to the state. Finally, we define `Transitions` which contains the transition logic of the state machine.

## Implementing the State Machine Logic

Now, let's create the core FSM logic using Vue.js reactivity:

```plaintext
// src/composables/useFSM.ts
import { reactive, ref, readonly, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { FSMConfig, State, Event, Context } from '../types/fsm'

export function useFSM(config: FSMConfig) {
  const state = ref<State>(config.initial)
  const context = reactive<Context>({ ...config.context })
  const history = ref<State[]>([config.initial]) // Keep track of state history

  const send = (event: Event) => {
    const currentState = state.value
    const transitions = config.transitions?.[currentState]

    if (!transitions) {
      console.warn(`No transitions defined for state: ${currentState}`)
      return
    }

    const transitionDefinition = transitions[event.type]

    if (!transitionDefinition) {
      console.warn(`No transition defined for event ${event.type} in state: ${currentState}`)
      return
    }

    if (transitionDefinition.condition && !transitionDefinition.condition(context)) {
      console.log(`Condition not met for event ${event.type} in state: ${currentState}`)
      return
    }

    const target = transitionDefinition.target

    const nextState = typeof target === 'function' ? target(context) : target

    if (nextState === currentState) {
      // Prevent redundant state changes
      console.log(`State remains the same: ${nextState}`)
      return
    }

    // Execute onExit handler for the current state
    config.states?.[currentState]?.onExit?.()

    // Execute the transition effect
    transitionDefinition.effect?.(context, event)

    // Update the state
    state.value = nextState

    //Record History
    history.value.push(nextState)

    // Execute onEnter handler for the new state
    config.states?.[nextState]?.onEnter?.()

    console.log(`Transitioned from ${currentState} to ${nextState} due to event ${event.type}`)
  }

  //Lifecycle hooks
  onMounted(() => {
    config.states?.[config.initial]?.onEnter?.()
  })

  return {
    state: readonly(state),
    context: readonly(context),
    send,
    history: readonly(history),
  }
}
```

This `useFSM` composable takes the FSM configuration as input and returns the current `state`, the `context`, and a `send` function that triggers transitions. It makes use of `ref` and `reactive` from Vue to ensure reactivity. It also includes helpful console logs for debugging, a condition to prevent redundant state changes, and optional `onEnter` and `onExit` handlers for each state. History is also tracked to provide state management for things like "undo" or "back" functions.

## Defining the FSM Configuration

Now, let's define the actual FSM configuration for our loading indicator:

```plaintext
// src/fsm/loadingFSM.ts
import { FSMConfig, State, Event } from '../types/fsm'
import { ref } from 'vue'

const loadingFSMConfig: FSMConfig = {
  initial: 'idle',
  context: {
    data: null,
    error: null,
  },
  states: {
    idle: {
      onEnter: () => {
        console.log('Entering idle state')
      },
    },
    loading: {
      onEnter: () => {
        console.log('Starting loading...')
      },
      onExit: () => {
        console.log('Loading complete (or failed).')
      },
    },
    loaded: {
      onEnter: () => {
        console.log('Data loaded successfully!')
      },
    },
    error: {
      onEnter: () => {
        console.error('An error occurred during loading.')
      },
    },
  },
  transitions: {
    idle: {
      FETCH: {
        target: 'loading',
        effect: (context) => {
          // Reset context when starting a new fetch
          context.data = null
          context.error = null
        },
      },
    },
    loading: {
      RESOLVE: {
        target: 'loaded',
        effect: (context, event) => {
          if (event && event.type === 'RESOLVE') {
            context.data = event.data
          }
        },
      },
      REJECT: {
        target: 'error',
        effect: (context, event) => {
          if (event && event.type === 'REJECT') {
            context.error = event.error
          }
        },
      },
    },
    loaded: {
      RESET: {
        target: 'idle',
        effect: (context) => {
          context.data = null
        },
      },
    },
    error: {
      RESET: {
        target: 'idle',
        effect: (context) => {
          context.error = null
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

export default loadingFSMConfig
```

This configuration defines the initial state, the states with optional `onEnter` and `onExit` handlers (which perform side effects when entering and exiting each state), and the transitions between states. We also define `effect` functions which manipulate the context based on the event that triggered the transition.

## Integrating the FSM into a Vue Component

Now, let's use the `useFSM` composable in a Vue component:

```vue
// src/components/LoadingComponent.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Current State: {{ state }}</p>

    <div v-if="state === 'idle'">
      <button @click="loadData">Load Data</button>
    </div>

    <div v-if="state === 'loading'">
      <p>Loading...</p>
    </div>

    <div v-if="state === 'loaded'">
      <p>Data: {{ context.data }}</p>
      <button @click="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>

    <div v-if="state === 'error'">
      <p>Error: {{ context.error }}</p>
      <button @click="reset">Reset</button>
    </div>

    <p>History: {{ history }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { useFSM } from '../composables/useFSM'
import loadingFSMConfig from '../fsm/loadingFSM'

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'LoadingComponent',
  setup() {
    const { state, context, send, history } = useFSM(loadingFSMConfig)

    const loadData = async () => {
      send({ type: 'FETCH' })

      try {
        // Simulate an API call
        const data = await new Promise((resolve) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            resolve('Successfully loaded data!')
          }, 2000)
        })

        send({ type: 'RESOLVE', data })
      } catch (error: any) {
        send({ type: 'REJECT', error: error.message || 'Unknown error' })
      }
    }

    const reset = () => {
      send({ type: 'RESET' })
    }

    return {
      state,
      context,
      loadData,
      reset,
      history,
    }
  },
})
</script>
```

This component uses the `useFSM` composable to manage the state of the loading indicator. It displays different content based on the current state and provides buttons to trigger transitions. A simulated API call is used for demonstration.

## Benefits of this approach

- **Type safety**: TypeScript ensures that your states and events are correctly typed, preventing runtime errors.
- **Reactivity**: Vue's reactivity system automatically updates the UI when the state changes.
- **Lightweight**: This approach provides a simple and lightweight alternative to larger FSM libraries for simpler use cases.
- **Composable**: The `useFSM` composable can be easily reused in different components.
- **Explicit State Management:** Defines the state transitions and states in a concise and easily read manner.

## Further Enhancements

Here are some ways you can enhance this FSM implementation:

- **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling, including retry mechanisms or more detailed error messages.
- **Asynchronous Transitions:** Handle asynchronous transitions more gracefully, potentially using a queue to manage multiple events.
- **Visualization:** Integrate a visualization library to visually represent the FSM.
- **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the FSM behaves as expected.
- **Conditional Transitions:** Add support for conditional transitions, allowing transitions to occur only under certain conditions. This is already implemented in the provided code through the `condition` field in the transition definition.
- **Guards:** Implement guards (similar to XState) that can prevent transitions from occurring based on the current context. The `condition` property in the `TransitionDefinition` provides this capability.
- **Actions:** Add actions (similar to XState) that are executed when a transition occurs. The `effect` property in the `TransitionDefinition` provides this capability.
- **Hierarchical States:** Implement hierarchical states to model more complex systems. This could involve nesting `useFSM` composables within each other.

## Conclusion

This guide has shown you how to build a type-safe Finite State Machine with Vue.js reactivity and TypeScript. By leveraging Vue's reactivity system and TypeScript's type checking, you can create robust, maintainable, and predictable applications. Remember to consider the complexity of your application when choosing between a lightweight FSM implementation like this one and a more feature-rich library like XState. This composable approach is a great way to add state management to simple components and applications, while XState is better for complex projects with many moving parts. By mastering this technique, you can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of your Vue.js applications.
