# Configure Liveness and Readiness Probes for Spring Boot Applications

Running Spring Boot applications in a containerized environment like Kubernetes unlocks numerous benefits, including scalability, resilience, and efficient resource utilization.  However, to truly leverage these advantages, it's crucial to configure proper health checks, specifically **liveness and readiness probes**. These probes allow Kubernetes to monitor the health and availability of your application and automatically restart or redirect traffic as needed. This ensures high availability and a better user experience.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through how to configure liveness and readiness probes for your Spring Boot applications, providing code examples and best practices along the way.

## What are Liveness and Readiness Probes?

Before diving into the configuration, let's understand what liveness and readiness probes are and why they are important:

*   **Liveness Probe:**  A liveness probe checks if an application is still running and healthy. If the probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container.  Think of it as a "restart if dead" mechanism. A liveness probe failure indicates a critical problem that requires restarting the application. Examples include a deadlock, memory leak, or other unrecoverable errors.

*   **Readiness Probe:**  A readiness probe checks if an application is ready to serve traffic. If the probe fails, Kubernetes will stop sending traffic to the container. This is useful when your application is still initializing, has dependencies that are not yet available, or is performing maintenance tasks.  A readiness probe failure indicates that the application is currently unavailable to handle requests, but it's not necessarily in a critical state requiring a restart.

## Why are Liveness and Readiness Probes Important?

Without liveness and readiness probes, Kubernetes has no way to understand the internal state of your application. It might continue sending traffic to an unresponsive application or fail to restart a crashed container.

*   **Improved Availability:**  By restarting failing containers, liveness probes prevent extended downtime.
*   **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** Readiness probes ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy containers during deployments and updates.
*   **Automated Recovery:**  When applications experience temporary issues, probes allow Kubernetes to automatically recover them.
*   **Better Resource Utilization:** By not sending traffic to unready containers, resources are used more efficiently.

## Configuring Liveness and Readiness Probes in Spring Boot

There are several ways to configure liveness and readiness probes for Spring Boot applications. We'll cover the most common and effective approaches:

### 1. Spring Boot Actuator

The Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features, including health endpoints that can be used for liveness and readiness probes.  This is the recommended approach.

**a. Add Spring Boot Actuator Dependency:**

First, add the Spring Boot Actuator dependency to your `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) file:

**Maven (`pom.xml`):**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle (`build.gradle`):**

```gradle
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'
```

**b. Configure Health Indicators:**

Spring Boot Actuator comes with default health indicators that check the status of various components, such as the database connection, disk space, and more. You can customize these indicators or create your own.

**Example: Custom Health Indicator:**

Let's create a simple health indicator that checks if a specific property is set.

```java
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.Health;
import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.HealthIndicator;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CustomHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {

    @Value("${custom.property:}")
    private String customProperty;

    @Override
    public Health health() {
        if (customProperty.isEmpty()) {
            return Health.down().withDetail("message", "Custom property is not set").build();
        }
        return Health.up().withDetail("message", "Custom property is set").build();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `@Component`: Marks this class as a Spring component, making it available for dependency injection.
*   `@Value("${custom.property:}")`:  Injects the value of the `custom.property` from the application configuration. The `:` after the property name provides a default value (empty string in this case) if the property is not set.
*   `health()`:  This method is called by the Spring Boot Actuator to determine the health status.
*   `Health.down()`:  Indicates that the application is unhealthy.
*   `Health.up()`:  Indicates that the application is healthy.
*   `withDetail()`: Adds details to the health status, providing more context.

**c. Expose Health Endpoints:**

By default, Actuator endpoints are not exposed. You need to configure them in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

**application.properties:**

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health, info
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always # Show full details of health checks
management.health.probes.enabled=true # Enable liveness and readiness probes
```

**application.yml:**

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
  health:
    probes:
      enabled: true
```

**Important Notes:**

*   `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health, info`:  Exposes the `health` and `info` endpoints.  You can expose other endpoints as needed.  Be careful exposing sensitive endpoints in production.
*   `management.endpoint.health.show-details=always`: Shows detailed information about each health indicator. This can be helpful for debugging.
*   `management.health.probes.enabled=true`: This is crucial!  Enables the dedicated liveness and readiness probe endpoints.  Without this, Kubernetes will need to infer the readiness state based on the overall health status, which can be less precise.

**d. Accessing the Endpoints:**

After configuring the Actuator, you can access the health endpoints at:

*   `/actuator/health`:  Returns a summary of the application's health.
*   `/actuator/health/liveness`: Returns the liveness probe status.
*   `/actuator/health/readiness`: Returns the readiness probe status.

**e. Understanding the Response:**

The `/actuator/health` endpoint returns a JSON response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "customHealthIndicator": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "message": "Custom property is set"
      }
    },
    "diskSpace": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "total": 499963680768,
        "free": 367209056256,
        "threshold": 10485760,
        "exists": true
      }
    },
    "ping": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}
```

The `/actuator/health/liveness` and `/actuator/health/readiness` endpoints will return a simpler JSON response:

```json
{
  "status": "UP"
}
```

If the status is `DOWN`, it indicates a failure.

### 2.  Kubernetes Configuration

Now that you have the health endpoints exposed, you need to configure your Kubernetes deployment to use them as liveness and readiness probes.

**Example Kubernetes Deployment YAML:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-boot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spring-boot-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: spring-boot-app
          image: your-docker-registry/spring-boot-app:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health/liveness
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 3
            successThreshold: 1
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health/readiness
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
            timeoutSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 3
            successThreshold: 1
```

**Explanation:**

*   `livenessProbe`: Configures the liveness probe.
    *   `httpGet`:  Specifies that the probe should use an HTTP GET request.
        *   `path`: The path to the liveness endpoint (`/actuator/health/liveness`).
        *   `port`: The port your application is listening on (8080 in this example).
    *   `initialDelaySeconds`:  The number of seconds to wait before the first probe is executed (30 seconds is a common starting point).
    *   `periodSeconds`:  How often (in seconds) to perform the probe (10 seconds is a good balance).
    *   `timeoutSeconds`:  How long (in seconds) the probe should wait for a response (5 seconds is generally sufficient).
    *   `failureThreshold`:  The number of consecutive failures required before Kubernetes considers the probe failed and restarts the container (3 is a common value).
    *   `successThreshold`: The number of consecutive successful probes after a failure required to mark the container as healthy.
*   `readinessProbe`: Configures the readiness probe.  It's configured similarly to the liveness probe, but points to the readiness endpoint (`/actuator/health/readiness`).

**Important Considerations for Kubernetes Configuration:**

*   **Initial Delay:** `initialDelaySeconds` is crucial, especially for readiness probes.  Give your application enough time to start up and become ready before probes are executed.
*   **Probe Frequency:** `periodSeconds` should be set to a reasonable value.  Too frequent probes can add unnecessary load, while infrequent probes might not detect problems quickly enough.
*   **Timeout:**  `timeoutSeconds` should be long enough to allow your application to respond but short enough to prevent Kubernetes from waiting too long for a response.
*   **Failure Threshold:** Adjust `failureThreshold` based on your application's tolerance for temporary glitches.
*   **HTTP Status Codes:**  By default, Kubernetes considers any HTTP status code in the 200-399 range as a success.  You can configure this using the `httpHeaders` section within the `httpGet` probe configuration to specify expected status codes.

### 3.  Alternative Approaches (Less Recommended)

While Spring Boot Actuator is the preferred method, here are a couple of alternative approaches, though they are generally less flexible and maintainable:

*   **Implementing Custom HTTP Endpoints:** You could create your own dedicated HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/liveness` and `/readiness`) and implement the health check logic within those endpoints. This requires more manual coding and management compared to using Actuator.

*   **Executing Commands:**  You can configure probes to execute commands within the container.  This is less common for Spring Boot applications, as it often requires shell scripting and might not be as portable. For example:

    ```yaml
          livenessProbe:
            exec:
              command: ["cat", "/tmp/healthy"] # Check if a file exists
    ```

    This approach is generally not recommended unless you have very specific needs that cannot be addressed with HTTP probes.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Spring Boot Actuator:**  Leverage the power and flexibility of Spring Boot Actuator for health checks.
*   **Custom Health Indicators:**  Implement custom health indicators to monitor specific aspects of your application and dependencies.
*   **Differentiate Liveness and Readiness:** Clearly distinguish between liveness and readiness checks.  A readiness probe should only fail if the application is not ready to serve traffic.  A liveness probe should only fail if the application is truly unhealthy and requires a restart.
*   **Appropriate Probe Configuration:**  Carefully configure the probe parameters (initial delay, period, timeout, failure threshold) based on your application's needs.
*   **Avoid Overly Complex Checks:**  Keep the probes simple and focused.  Avoid performing resource-intensive operations within the probes, as this can impact application performance.
*   **Monitor Probes:**  Monitor the health of your application and the effectiveness of your probes.  Adjust the configuration as needed based on your observations.
*   **Security Considerations:** If you expose Actuator endpoints, make sure to secure them appropriately to prevent unauthorized access.  Consider using Spring Security to protect these endpoints.
*   **Logging:** Include sufficient logging in your health indicators to help diagnose any issues.
