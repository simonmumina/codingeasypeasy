# TypeScript with Expo: A Comprehensive Configuration Guide for 2025

TypeScript has become a cornerstone of modern JavaScript development, offering static typing, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer tooling. When combined with Expo, the popular framework for building universal React Native applications, you get a powerful and efficient development workflow. This guide provides an in-depth walkthrough of configuring your Expo project with TypeScript, covering everything from initial setup to advanced considerations.

## Why TypeScript with Expo?

Before we dive into the configuration, let's briefly explore the benefits of using TypeScript with Expo:

- **Improved Code Quality:** TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors early in the development process, reducing runtime surprises.
- **Enhanced Code Maintainability:** Explicit type annotations make your code easier to understand and maintain, especially in large projects.
- **Better Developer Tooling:** TypeScript integrates seamlessly with IDEs like VS Code, providing features like autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring.
- **Increased Confidence:** Knowing your code adheres to specific types allows for more confident refactoring and faster debugging.
- **Collaboration Boost:** Well-defined types clearly communicate the structure and behavior of your code to other developers on your team.

## Setting Up Your Expo Project with TypeScript

There are two primary ways to create an Expo project with TypeScript support:

**1. Using the Expo CLI (Recommended)**

The Expo CLI provides a streamlined way to initialize a TypeScript-ready project. This is the recommended approach for new projects.

- **Install the Expo CLI:**

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

- **Create a new Expo project with the `typescript` template:**

  ```plaintext
  expo init MyAwesomeApp --template tabs@ts
  ```

  or

  ```plaintext
  expo init
  # Choose the "blank (TypeScript)" template or a template that supports Typescript such as 'tabs (Typescript)'
  # Navigate to the directory
  cd MyAwesomeApp
  ```

  The `--template` flag allows you to select a pre-configured template, in this case a tabbed template. If you don't use the `--template` flag you will be guided through the different templates. The blank template is the simplest and a good starting point.

- **Run your app:**

  ```plaintext
  expo start
  ```

  This will start the Expo development server, allowing you to run your app on a simulator/emulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app.

**2. Adding TypeScript to an Existing Expo Project**

If you already have an Expo project, you can add TypeScript support using the following steps:

- **Install TypeScript and related dependencies:**

  ```plaintext
  npx expo install typescript @types/react @types/react-native @types/jest
  ```

  This command installs the core TypeScript compiler, type definitions for React and React Native, and optional type definitions for Jest, if you're using it for testing. `@types/react` and `@types/react-native` are crucial as they provide type definitions for React and React Native components and APIs. This allows TypeScript to understand and validate your React and React Native code. `@types/jest` provides type definitions for the Jest testing framework.

- **Create a `tsconfig.json` file:**

  Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project. This file configures the TypeScript compiler. You can use the following basic configuration:

  ```plaintext
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "esnext",
      "module": "esnext",
      "jsx": "react-native",
      "lib": ["esnext"],
      "moduleResolution": "node",
      "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "noEmit": true,
      "isolatedModules": true,
      "strict": true,
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "*": ["./src/*"] // Adjust this path based on your project structure
      },
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "resolveJsonModule": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
    },
    "exclude": ["node_modules"]
  }
  ```

  **Explanation of `tsconfig.json` options:**

  - `target`: Specifies the ECMAScript target version. `esnext` supports the latest JavaScript features.
  - `module`: Specifies the module system. `esnext` allows for modern module loading.
  - `jsx`: Specifies the JSX transformation mode. `react-native` is correct for React Native.
  - `lib`: Includes predefined type definitions for the target environment (JavaScript features, DOM APIs etc.). `esnext` provides a set of the latest features.
  - `moduleResolution`: Specifies how TypeScript resolves module imports. `node` mimics Node.js's module resolution strategy.
  - `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Allows importing modules that don't have a default export as if they did.
  - `esModuleInterop`: Enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES modules.
  - `noEmit`: Prevents TypeScript from emitting JavaScript files, as Expo handles the compilation.
  - `isolatedModules`: Ensures that each file can be compiled independently.
  - `strict`: Enables all strict type-checking options for improved code safety. **This is highly recommended.**
  - `baseUrl`: The base directory to resolve non-absolute module names. Setting it to "." means the project root.
  - `paths`: Allows you to map import paths to specific locations in your project, improving code organization. The example above allows you to import files from your `src` folder using absolute paths like `import Component from 'Component'`. Remember to adjust the path if you have a different project structure.
  - `skipLibCheck`: Skips type checking of declaration files (`.d.ts`). Useful for improving compilation speed but can hide some type errors in library definitions.
  - `resolveJsonModule`: Allows importing JSON files as modules. Very helpful for configuration files and data.
  - `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`: Prevents issues related to file system case-sensitivity, especially when working on different platforms.

- **Rename your JavaScript files to TypeScript files:**

  Rename your `.js` and `.jsx` files to `.ts` and `.tsx` respectively. For example, rename `App.js` to `App.tsx`. `.tsx` is used for files that contain JSX (React components).

- **Update your imports:**

  Adjust your import statements to reflect the new file extensions (e.g., `import App from './App';` becomes `import App from './App';`). No changes are needed in the import path itself as the file extension is implicit during module resolution when using TypeScript.

- **Start using TypeScript!**

  You can now start adding type annotations to your code and leveraging TypeScript's features.

## Example: Converting a Simple Component to TypeScript

Let's consider a simple React Native component written in JavaScript:

```plaintext
// JavaScript (App.js)
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

const App = () => {
  const message = 'Hello, Expo with JavaScript!'

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{message}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default App
```

Here's the same component converted to TypeScript:

```plaintext
// TypeScript (App.tsx)
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

interface Props {} // Define a type for props if needed. In this case, it's an empty object.

const App: React.FC<Props> = () => {
  const message: string = "Hello, Expo with TypeScript!";

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{message}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`React.FC<Props>`:** This defines the component as a functional component (`FC`) using React's type definitions. `<Props>` specifies the type of the component's props. We define an empty `Props` interface in this example because this component takes no props. If it took props, we would define the properties in that interface.
- **`message: string`:** This explicitly types the `message` variable as a string.

## Type Definitions

One of the most important aspects of using TypeScript is understanding type definitions. Type definitions provide information about the shape of objects, functions, and other values, allowing TypeScript to perform type checking.

- **Built-in Types:** TypeScript has built-in types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `any`.

- **Interfaces:** Interfaces define the structure of an object. You can use interfaces to specify the types of props, state, or other data structures. (See the `Props` interface example above).

- **Types:** Types are similar to interfaces but can also be used to define more complex type structures, such as unions and intersections.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using a Type Alias

  type Result =
    | {
        success: true
        data: any
      }
    | {
        success: false
        error: string
      }
  ```

- **Generic Types:** Generic types allow you to write code that can work with different types while still maintaining type safety.

  ```plaintext
  // Example using Generics
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg
  }

  let myString: string = identity<string>('hello') // type of myString: string
  let myNumber: number = identity<number>(123) // type of myNumber: number
  ```

## Working with React Native Types

React Native provides its own set of type definitions that you can use in your TypeScript code. Some common types include:

- **`StyleProp<ViewStyle>`:** Represents a style object for a `View` component. Use this to type your style props.
- **`TextStyle`:** Represents a style object for a `Text` component.
- **`ImageSourcePropType`:** Represents the source of an image (e.g., a URL or a local file).
- **`TouchableOpacityProps`:** Represents the props for a `TouchableOpacity` component.

You can import these types from the `react-native` module:

```plaintext
import { View, Text, StyleProp, ViewStyle, ImageSourcePropType } from 'react-native';

interface MyComponentProps {
  style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
  imageSource: ImageSourcePropType;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ style, imageSource }) => {
  return (
    <View style={style}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
      {/* Example using imageSource is outside the scope here */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Advanced Configuration and Best Practices

- **ESLint and Prettier:** Integrate ESLint and Prettier with TypeScript to enforce code style and formatting. Install the necessary packages:

  ```plaintext
  npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
  ```

  Create `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` files to configure ESLint and Prettier according to your preferences. Here are examples of commonly used configurations:

  **`.eslintrc.js`:**

  ```plaintext
  module.exports = {
    parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
    parserOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2020,
      sourceType: 'module',
      ecmaFeatures: {
        jsx: true,
      },
    },
    settings: {
      react: {
        version: 'detect',
      },
    },
    extends: [
      'eslint:recommended',
      'plugin:react/recommended',
      'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
      'prettier/@typescript-eslint',
      'plugin:prettier/recommended',
    ],
    rules: {
      'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off', // No need to import React in newer React versions
      '@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type': 'off', // Allows omitting return types
    },
  }
  ```

  **`.prettierrc.js`:**

  ```plaintext
  module.exports = {
    semi: false,
    trailingComma: 'es5',
    singleQuote: true,
    printWidth: 100,
    tabWidth: 2,
  }
  ```

  Then, add lint and format scripts to your `package.json`:

  ```plaintext
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
  ```

  Now, you can run `npm run lint` to check your code for style issues and `npm run format` to automatically format your code.

- **Path Aliases:** Use path aliases in your `tsconfig.json` to simplify import statements. For example, you can map `@components` to your `src/components` directory:

  ```plaintext
  // tsconfig.json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "@components/*": ["./src/components/*"],
        "@screens/*": ["./src/screens/*"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Then you can import components like this: `import MyComponent from '@components/MyComponent';`

- **Global Type Declarations:** Create a `global.d.ts` file to declare global types that you want to use throughout your project. This is helpful for defining types for environment variables or other global data. For example, this file should be located in your `src` folder or another appropriate directory.

  ```plaintext
  // global.d.ts
  declare global {
    interface Window {
      __REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__: any // Example for Redux DevTools
    }

    namespace NodeJS {
      interface ProcessEnv {
        API_URL: string
        // Add other environment variables here
      }
    }
  }

  export {} // This is important to make it a module declaration
  ```

  Be sure that the file where you make global type declarations gets compiled. This can be accomplished by including it within the `"include"` array or as part of the files included based on `"exclude"` within your tsconfig file.

- **Custom Hooks:** Define the return types and argument types of your custom React hooks for better type safety.

  ```plaintext
  import { useState } from 'react'

  interface UseCounter {
    count: number
    increment: () => void
    decrement: () => void
  }

  const useCounter = (initialValue: number = 0): UseCounter => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue)

    const increment = () => {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1)
    }

    const decrement = () => {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount - 1)
    }

    return { count, increment, decrement }
  }

  export default useCounter
  ```

- **Testing with TypeScript:** Ensure that your tests are written in TypeScript and properly typed. Use `@types/jest` for Jest and consider using testing libraries like React Testing Library, which integrates well with TypeScript.

## Common TypeScript Issues and Solutions

- **"Cannot find module" error:** This usually happens when the module resolution is not configured correctly. Double-check your `tsconfig.json`'s `moduleResolution` and `paths` settings.
- **"Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'" error:** This indicates a type mismatch. Ensure that your variables are properly typed and that you handle cases where a value might be undefined. Use optional properties or union types (e.g., `string | undefined`).
- **"JSX element type '...' does not have any construct or call signatures" error:** This often occurs when you're using a component from a library that doesn't have proper type definitions. Check if there's a `@types` package for the library or consider creating your own type definitions.

## Conclusion

Configuring your Expo project with TypeScript is a valuable investment that will pay off in the long run. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can create a more robust, maintainable, and enjoyable development experience. Remember to embrace type definitions, utilize ESLint and Prettier for code quality, and explore advanced configurations like path aliases to streamline your workflow. Happy coding!
