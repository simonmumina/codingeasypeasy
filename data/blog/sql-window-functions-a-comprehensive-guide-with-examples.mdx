# SQL Window Functions: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

SQL window functions are a powerful tool for performing calculations across sets of table rows that are related to the current row. They are similar to aggregate functions, but instead of grouping the rows into a single summary row, window functions return a value for _each_ row. This allows you to perform calculations like running totals, rankings, and moving averages within a result set without needing to use subqueries or self-joins.

This blog post provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using SQL window functions, complete with practical examples.

## What are Window Functions?

Think of window functions as allowing you to look "through a window" at a specific subset (a "window") of your data for each row in your result set. This window can be defined by a specific order or partition, and the window function then performs a calculation on the rows within that window. The result of that calculation is then associated with the current row being processed.

**Key Advantages of Window Functions:**

- **More Efficient:** Often more efficient than equivalent queries using subqueries or joins.
- **Simpler Syntax:** Can often simplify complex queries.
- **Greater Flexibility:** Allows for calculations that are difficult or impossible to achieve with standard aggregate functions.
- **Row Context:** Maintains the individual row context while performing calculations across related rows.

## Basic Syntax of Window Functions

The general syntax of a window function is as follows:

```plaintext
WINDOW_FUNCTION(arguments) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    [ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [ROWS | RANGE frame_extent]
)
```

Let's break down each part:

- **`WINDOW_FUNCTION(arguments)`:** The function you want to apply to the window (e.g., `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `RANK()`). Some window functions don't take arguments (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`).
- **`OVER(...)`:** This clause is what distinguishes a window function from a regular aggregate function.
  - **`PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...` (Optional):** Divides the rows into partitions based on the specified columns. The window function is applied independently to each partition. If `PARTITION BY` is omitted, the entire result set is treated as a single partition.
  - **`ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...` (Optional):** Specifies the order of rows within each partition. This is crucial for functions like `RANK()`, `LAG()`, and `LEAD()`.
  - **`ROWS | RANGE frame_extent` (Optional):** Defines the "window frame" - the set of rows within the partition that the window function operates on. This is useful for calculating moving averages or running totals. If omitted, the default frame is `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` for functions with `ORDER BY` and `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` for functions without `ORDER BY`.

## Common Window Functions and Examples

Let's explore some of the most commonly used window functions with practical examples. We'll assume a table named `employees` with the following structure:

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, salary, hire_date) VALUES
(1, 10, 60000.00, '2022-01-15'),
(2, 10, 75000.00, '2022-03-01'),
(3, 20, 55000.00, '2022-05-10'),
(4, 20, 80000.00, '2022-07-20'),
(5, 10, 70000.00, '2022-09-05'),
(6, 20, 65000.00, '2022-11-12'),
(7, 30, 90000.00, '2023-01-01'),
(8, 30, 100000.00, '2023-03-15');

```

### 1. Ranking Functions: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`

These functions assign a rank to each row within a partition based on the specified order.

- **`RANK()`:** Assigns a rank based on the ordering. Rows with the same value receive the same rank, and the next rank is skipped.
- **`DENSE_RANK()`:** Similar to `RANK()`, but assigns consecutive ranks without gaps, even if there are ties.
- **`ROW_NUMBER()`:** Assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within the partition, regardless of value.

**Example: Rank employees by salary within each department:**

```plaintext
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_dense_rank,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_row_number
FROM
    employees;
```

**Output:**

| employee_id | department_id | salary    | salary_rank | salary_dense_rank | salary_row_number |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 2           | 10            | 75000.00  | 1           | 1                 | 1                 |
| 5           | 10            | 70000.00  | 2           | 2                 | 2                 |
| 1           | 10            | 60000.00  | 3           | 3                 | 3                 |
| 4           | 20            | 80000.00  | 1           | 1                 | 1                 |
| 6           | 20            | 65000.00  | 2           | 2                 | 2                 |
| 3           | 20            | 55000.00  | 3           | 3                 | 3                 |
| 8           | 30            | 100000.00 | 1           | 1                 | 1                 |
| 7           | 30            | 90000.00  | 2           | 2                 | 2                 |

**Explanation:**

- `PARTITION BY department_id`: The ranking is done separately for each department.
- `ORDER BY salary DESC`: Employees are ranked within each department based on their salary in descending order (highest salary gets rank 1).

### 2. Aggregate Window Functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()`

These aggregate functions can also be used as window functions to calculate aggregate values over a window of rows.

**Example: Calculate the cumulative salary within each department:**

```plaintext
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date) AS cumulative_salary
FROM
    employees;
```

**Output:**

| employee_id | department_id | salary    | cumulative_salary |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 1           | 10            | 60000.00  | 60000.00          |
| 2           | 10            | 75000.00  | 135000.00         |
| 5           | 10            | 70000.00  | 205000.00         |
| 3           | 20            | 55000.00  | 55000.00          |
| 4           | 20            | 80000.00  | 135000.00         |
| 6           | 20            | 65000.00  | 200000.00         |
| 7           | 30            | 90000.00  | 90000.00          |
| 8           | 30            | 100000.00 | 190000.00         |

**Explanation:**

- `SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date)`: Calculates the sum of salaries for each employee and all employees hired before them within the same department, ordered by `hire_date`.

### 3. Value Window Functions: `LAG()`, `LEAD()`

These functions allow you to access data from previous or subsequent rows within the partition.

- **`LAG(column, offset, default_value)`:** Accesses the value of the `column` from the row `offset` rows _before_ the current row. If there's no row at the specified offset, it returns `default_value`.
- **`LEAD(column, offset, default_value)`:** Accesses the value of the `column` from the row `offset` rows _after_ the current row. If there's no row at the specified offset, it returns `default_value`.

**Example: Calculate the salary difference between each employee and the previous employee hired in the same department:**

```plaintext
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    hire_date,
    LAG(salary, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date) AS previous_salary,
    salary - LAG(salary, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date) AS salary_difference
FROM
    employees;
```

**Output:**

| employee_id | department_id | salary    | hire_date  | previous_salary | salary_difference |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| 1           | 10            | 60000.00  | 2022-01-15 | 0.00            | 60000.00          |
| 2           | 10            | 75000.00  | 2022-03-01 | 60000.00        | 15000.00          |
| 5           | 10            | 70000.00  | 2022-09-05 | 75000.00        | -5000.00          |
| 3           | 20            | 55000.00  | 2022-05-10 | 0.00            | 55000.00          |
| 4           | 20            | 80000.00  | 2022-07-20 | 55000.00        | 25000.00          |
| 6           | 20            | 65000.00  | 2022-11-12 | 80000.00        | -15000.00         |
| 7           | 30            | 90000.00  | 2023-01-01 | 0.00            | 90000.00          |
| 8           | 30            | 100000.00 | 2023-03-15 | 90000.00        | 10000.00          |

**Explanation:**

- `LAG(salary, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY hire_date)`: Gets the salary of the previous employee hired in the same department, ordered by `hire_date`. If there is no previous employee (for the first employee hired), it returns 0.

### 4. First_Value and Last_Value

These window functions return the first or last value from the window.

- **`FIRST_VALUE(column) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`:** Retrieves the first value of the specified column within the defined window frame.
- **`LAST_VALUE(column) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)`:** Retrieves the last value of the specified column within the defined window frame.

**Example: Find the highest salary in each department and display it alongside each employee's record:**

```plaintext
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_salary_in_department
FROM
    employees;
```

**Output:**

| employee_id | department_id | salary    | highest_salary_in_department |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2           | 10            | 75000.00  | 75000.00                     |
| 5           | 10            | 70000.00  | 75000.00                     |
| 1           | 10            | 60000.00  | 75000.00                     |
| 4           | 20            | 80000.00  | 80000.00                     |
| 6           | 20            | 65000.00  | 80000.00                     |
| 3           | 20            | 55000.00  | 80000.00                     |
| 8           | 30            | 100000.00 | 100000.00                    |
| 7           | 30            | 90000.00  | 100000.00                    |

**Explanation:**

- `FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC)`: For each employee, find the first salary (highest due to the `DESC` ordering) in the respective department.

### 5. NTILE()

The `NTILE()` window function divides the rows in a partition into a specified number of ranked groups. Each row is assigned a "tile number" indicating which group it belongs to.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
NTILE(number_of_tiles) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)
```

**Example: Divide employees into 4 groups (quartiles) based on salary within each department:**

```plaintext
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    salary,
    NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_quartile
FROM
    employees;
```

**Output:**

| employee_id | department_id | salary    | salary_quartile |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 2           | 10            | 75000.00  | 1               |
| 5           | 10            | 70000.00  | 2               |
| 1           | 10            | 60000.00  | 3               |
| 4           | 20            | 80000.00  | 1               |
| 6           | 20            | 65000.00  | 2               |
| 3           | 20            | 55000.00  | 3               |
| 8           | 30            | 100000.00 | 1               |
| 7           | 30            | 90000.00  | 1               |

**Explanation:**

- `NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC)`: Divides the employees in each department into 4 groups based on their salary, with the highest salary earners in group 1.

## Window Frames

As mentioned earlier, the `ROWS` or `RANGE` clause in the `OVER` clause allows you to define a window frame. The window frame specifies the set of rows within the partition that the window function operates on.

**Common Frame Specifications:**

- **`ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` (Default if `ORDER BY` is present):** Includes all rows from the beginning of the partition up to and including the current row.
- **`ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` (Default if `ORDER BY` is absent):** Includes all rows in the partition.
- **`ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`:** Includes the `n` rows preceding the current row and the current row.
- **`ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND n FOLLOWING`:** Includes the current row and the `n` rows following the current row.
- **`ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND n FOLLOWING`:** Includes the `n` rows preceding the current row, the current row, and the `n` rows following the current row.
- **`RANGE BETWEEN value PRECEDING AND value FOLLOWING`:** This frame is based on the _values_ of the `ORDER BY` column rather than row numbers.

**Example: Calculate a 3-day moving average of sales:**

Assuming a `sales` table with `sale_date` and `amount` columns:

```plaintext
SELECT
    sale_date,
    amount,
    AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_average
FROM
    sales;
```

**Explanation:**

- `AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`: Calculates the average `amount` for each day, considering the current day and the two preceding days.

## Best Practices for Using Window Functions

- **Understand the Data:** Carefully analyze your data and the problem you are trying to solve to choose the appropriate window function and frame.
- **Use `PARTITION BY` Strategically:** Partitioning allows you to perform calculations independently on different subsets of your data.
- **Order Your Data Carefully:** The `ORDER BY` clause is crucial for functions like `RANK()`, `LAG()`, and `LEAD()`, and for defining meaningful window frames.
- **Consider Performance:** While window functions are often more efficient than subqueries or joins, complex window function queries can still be resource-intensive. Make sure to test your queries on large datasets and optimize them if necessary.
- **Check Your Database Support:** Window function support varies slightly across different database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle). Consult your database documentation to ensure that the functions you are using are supported.
