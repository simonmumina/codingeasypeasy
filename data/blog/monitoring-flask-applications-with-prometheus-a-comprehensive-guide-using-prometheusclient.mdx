# Monitoring Flask Applications with Prometheus: A Comprehensive Guide using prometheus_client

Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of any application, especially in production environments. Prometheus, a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, provides a powerful way to collect and analyze metrics from your applications. This blog post will guide you through instrumenting your Flask applications with Prometheus using the `prometheus_client` library, allowing you to gain valuable insights into your application's behavior.

## Why Use Prometheus with Flask?

Prometheus offers several advantages for monitoring Flask applications:

- **Real-time Metrics:** Gain immediate insight into the performance of your application with frequently updated metrics.
- **Flexible Querying:** Prometheus provides a powerful query language (PromQL) to analyze your metrics and create custom dashboards.
- **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on metric thresholds, enabling you to proactively address issues before they impact users.
- **Scalability:** Prometheus is designed to handle large volumes of metrics from numerous applications.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other tools like Grafana for visualization and alertmanager for handling alerts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.6+:** This guide assumes you have a working Python environment.
- **Flask:** Your Flask application that you want to monitor.
- **prometheus_client:** Install this library using pip: `pip install prometheus_client`
- **Prometheus Server:** A running Prometheus server configured to scrape your application's metrics endpoint (details on how to configure this are covered later).

## Step-by-Step Guide to Instrumenting Your Flask App

### 1. Installing the `prometheus_client` Library

As mentioned earlier, begin by installing the `prometheus_client` Python library:

```bash
pip install prometheus_client
```

### 2. Creating Metrics in Your Flask Application

The `prometheus_client` library provides various metric types, including:

- **Counter:** Tracks cumulative values that only increase or reset to zero (e.g., number of requests).
- **Gauge:** Represents a single numerical value that can increase or decrease (e.g., memory usage).
- **Histogram:** Samples observations (usually request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. Provides a distribution of the values.
- **Summary:** Similar to a histogram, but also calculates quantiles over a sliding time window (e.g., 95th percentile request latency).

Let's start by creating some simple metrics in our Flask application. Here's an example:

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest, REGISTRY

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define Prometheus metrics
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('app_http_requests_total', 'Total number of HTTP requests')
REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram('app_http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request latency in seconds')

@app.route('/')
@REQUEST_LATENCY.time()  # Use decorator to track latency automatically
def hello_world():
    REQUEST_COUNT.inc()  # Increment request count
    return 'Hello, World!'

# Expose metrics endpoint
@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    return Response(generate_latest(), mimetype='text/plain')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

**Explanation:**

- **`REQUEST_COUNT`**: A `Counter` metric to track the total number of HTTP requests.
- **`REQUEST_LATENCY`**: A `Histogram` metric to track the latency of HTTP requests in seconds. The `.time()` decorator automatically measures the duration of the function call.
- **`@REQUEST_LATENCY.time()`**: A decorator that automatically records the execution time of the `hello_world` function. This provides a simple way to measure request latency.
- **`REQUEST_COUNT.inc()`**: Increments the `REQUEST_COUNT` metric each time the `hello_world` function is called.
- **`/metrics` endpoint**: This endpoint exposes the metrics in a format that Prometheus can understand. `generate_latest()` serializes the metrics from the default `REGISTRY` into a text-based format.

### 3. Customizing Metrics

You can further customize your metrics by adding labels. Labels allow you to slice and dice your data based on different dimensions, such as HTTP method, status code, or user ID.

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest

app = Flask(__name__)

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter(
    'app_http_requests_total', 'Total number of HTTP requests',
    ['method', 'endpoint', 'status_code']
)
REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram(
    'app_http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request latency in seconds',
    ['method', 'endpoint']
)

@app.route('/')
@REQUEST_LATENCY.time()
def hello_world():
    REQUEST_COUNT.labels(method='GET', endpoint='/', status_code=200).inc()
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    return Response(generate_latest(), mimetype='text/plain')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

**Explanation:**

- **Labels in Metric Definition:** We've added labels `method`, `endpoint`, and `status_code` to the `REQUEST_COUNT` metric definition and `method` and `endpoint` to the `REQUEST_LATENCY` metric.
- **`labels()` method:** The `labels()` method is used to specify the values for each label when incrementing the counter. In this example, we're setting `method` to `GET`, `endpoint` to `/`, and `status_code` to `200` for each successful request.

### 4. Handling Different Request Types and Status Codes

To properly track request metrics for various scenarios, you'll want to capture the HTTP method, endpoint, and status code. Here's a more robust example using Flask's request context:

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, request, Response, make_response
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

REQUEST_COUNT = Counter(
    'app_http_requests_total', 'Total number of HTTP requests',
    ['method', 'endpoint', 'status_code']
)
REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram(
    'app_http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request latency in seconds',
    ['method', 'endpoint']
)


@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    start_time = time.time()
    response = make_response('Hello, World!')
    status_code = response.status_code
    end_time = time.time()
    latency = end_time - start_time

    REQUEST_COUNT.labels(
        method=request.method,
        endpoint=request.path,
        status_code=status_code
    ).inc()
    REQUEST_LATENCY.labels(method=request.method, endpoint=request.path).observe(latency)

    return response

@app.route('/error')
def error_route():
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        raise Exception("Simulated Error")
    except Exception as e:
        response = make_response("An error occurred", 500)
        status_code = response.status_code # will be 500
    finally:
        end_time = time.time()
        latency = end_time - start_time

        REQUEST_COUNT.labels(
            method=request.method,
            endpoint=request.path,
            status_code=status_code
        ).inc()
        REQUEST_LATENCY.labels(method=request.method, endpoint=request.path).observe(latency)

        return response # return 500

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    return Response(generate_latest(), mimetype='text/plain')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

**Key Improvements:**

- **`request.method` and `request.path`:** We use `request.method` and `request.path` from the Flask request context to dynamically capture the HTTP method and endpoint.
- **`status_code`:** Retrieves the response's status code after the route handler executes.
- **`make_response`:** Uses `make_response` to explicitly create a Flask response object, allowing us to access its `status_code` property.
- **Error Handling (`/error` Route):** Demonstrates how to capture metrics even when an exception occurs within a route. The `try...except...finally` block ensures that metrics are recorded regardless of whether the route succeeds or fails. We create a response with a 500 status code in the error route to simulate an error.

### 5. Setting Up Prometheus to Scrape Metrics

Now that your Flask application is exposing metrics, you need to configure Prometheus to scrape them. Create a `prometheus.yml` configuration file (or modify your existing one) with the following:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # Scrape every 15 seconds.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds.

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'flask_app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:5000'] # Replace with your Flask app's address
```

**Explanation:**

- **`scrape_interval`:** Specifies how often Prometheus should scrape metrics from the targets.
- **`scrape_configs`:** Defines the scraping configuration for your Flask application.
- **`job_name`:** A name for this scrape job.
- **`static_configs`:** Defines a list of target endpoints to scrape.
- **`targets`:** A list of host:port addresses where your Flask application's `/metrics` endpoint is exposed. **Make sure to replace `localhost:5000` with the actual address of your Flask application.**

After updating the `prometheus.yml` file, restart your Prometheus server for the changes to take effect.

### 6. Visualizing Metrics with Grafana (Optional)

While Prometheus provides a web interface for querying metrics, Grafana offers a more powerful and flexible way to visualize your data. You can connect Grafana to your Prometheus data source and create dashboards to monitor your Flask application's performance.

Here are some example Grafana panels you could create:

- **Total Request Count:** A simple graph showing the total number of requests over time.
- **Request Latency (Percentiles):** A graph showing the 95th and 99th percentile request latencies. This uses the `histogram_quantile` function.
- **Requests per Second (Rate):** A graph showing the rate of requests per second.
- **Error Rate:** A graph showing the rate of errors (status codes 5xx) per second.

Example PromQL queries for Grafana:

- **Total Request Count:** `sum(app_http_requests_total)`
- **95th Percentile Request Latency:** `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(app_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))`
- **Requests per Second:** `sum(rate(app_http_requests_total[5m]))`
- **Error Rate:** `sum(rate(app_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m]))`

### 7. Best Practices and Considerations

- **Metric Naming:** Follow a consistent naming convention for your metrics. Use prefixes like `app_` or `service_` to identify metrics specific to your application.
- **Label Cardinality:** Be mindful of the number of labels you use, as high-cardinality labels can significantly increase the storage requirements of Prometheus. Avoid using labels with unbounded values (e.g., user IDs) unless absolutely necessary.
- **Expose Necessary Metrics:** Focus on exposing metrics that provide meaningful insights into your application's performance. Don't expose everything just because you can.
- **Security:** If your `/metrics` endpoint is exposed publicly, consider implementing authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect your `/metrics` endpoint from abuse by implementing rate limiting.
- **Custom Collectors:** For more complex instrumentation scenarios, consider using custom collectors to gather and expose metrics from different sources.

### 8. Advanced Usage: Custom Collectors

While the built-in metric types are sufficient for many use cases, you might need to create custom collectors to expose more specific or complex metrics. Custom collectors allow you to gather data from various sources and present it in a format that Prometheus can understand.

Here's an example of a custom collector that exposes the number of active database connections:

```plaintext
from flask import Flask, request, Response
from prometheus_client import Gauge, CollectorRegistry, generate_latest, GaugeMetricFamily

app = Flask(__name__)

class DatabaseConnectionCollector:
    def collect(self):
        # Simulate fetching the number of active database connections
        active_connections = self.get_active_connections()

        # Create a GaugeMetricFamily
        g = GaugeMetricFamily('app_database_active_connections', 'Number of active database connections')
        g.add_metric([], active_connections)
        yield g

    def get_active_connections(self):
        # Replace this with your actual database connection logic
        # For example, using SQLAlchemy:
        # return len(db.engine.pool._connections)
        return 42  # Simulate 42 active connections


# Create a custom registry
registry = CollectorRegistry()
registry.register(DatabaseConnectionCollector())

@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    return Response(generate_latest(registry), mimetype='text/plain')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

**Explanation:**

- **`DatabaseConnectionCollector`:** A custom class that implements the `collect()` method.
- **`collect()` method:** This method is called by Prometheus when it scrapes the `/metrics` endpoint. It gathers the metrics data and yields a `GaugeMetricFamily` object.
- **`GaugeMetricFamily`:** Represents a Gauge metric. You create an instance of this class and add a metric to it with the desired value.
- **`get_active_connections()`:** This is a placeholder method. Replace this with your actual logic to retrieve the number of active database connections. The example comments show how this _could_ work with `SQLAlchemy`.
- **Custom Registry:** Creates a separate registry just for the custom collector.
- **`registry.register()`:** Registers the custom collector with the registry.
- **`generate_latest(registry)`:** The `generate_latest()` function is called with custom registry as an argument.
