# Mastering Expo Application Services (EAS): A Comprehensive Guide for 2025

Expo Application Services (EAS) is a suite of cloud services designed to simplify the build, update, and distribution processes for React Native applications built with Expo. It provides a seamless and efficient way to manage your app lifecycle, allowing you to focus on building amazing user experiences instead of struggling with complex configuration and deployment pipelines. This guide will walk you through the key features of EAS and provide practical examples to get you started.

## Why Use Expo Application Services (EAS)?

EAS offers several significant advantages over traditional methods of building and deploying React Native apps:

- **Simplified Build Process:** EAS Build handles the complexities of native builds for iOS and Android, freeing you from managing Xcode and Android Studio configurations locally.
- **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** EAS Update allows you to push updates to your app instantly without requiring users to download a new version from the app store. This is crucial for bug fixes and minor feature enhancements.
- **Effortless Submissions:** EAS Submit streamlines the process of submitting your app to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate EAS into your existing CI/CD workflows for automated builds and deployments.
- **Free Tier:** EAS provides a generous free tier allowing you to get started and explore the services without immediate financial commitment.
- **Managed Workflow Advantages:** EAS is designed to work seamlessly with the Expo managed workflow, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations. However, some EAS features can also be used with bare React Native projects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into EAS, ensure you have the following:

- **An Expo Project:** You'll need an existing Expo project. If you don't have one, create a new one using `npx create-expo-app my-app`.
- **Expo CLI:** Install the Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`. Make sure you're using the latest version for compatibility with EAS.
- **Expo Account:** Create an Expo account at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev) if you don't already have one.
- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

## Getting Started with EAS

### 1. Installing EAS CLI

The EAS CLI is your primary interface for interacting with EAS. Install it globally:

```plaintext
npm install -g eas-cli
# OR
yarn global add eas-cli
```

### 2. Logging in to EAS

Authenticate with your Expo account using the following command:

```plaintext
eas login
```

This will open a browser window where you can log in with your Expo credentials.

### 3. Initializing EAS in your Project

Navigate to your Expo project directory and run:

```plaintext
eas init
```

This command initializes EAS in your project by creating an `eas.json` file. This file configures your build profiles and update channels. You will be prompted to choose between setting up with JavaScript (EAS Build config) or Turtle CLI (legacy). For most new projects, choose the JavaScript option.

```plaintext title="eas.json Example"
{
  "cli": {
    "version": "latest"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

## EAS Build: Building Your App in the Cloud

EAS Build takes the burden of native builds off your shoulders. It utilizes Expo's cloud infrastructure to build your iOS and Android app binaries.

### 1. Configuring Build Profiles

The `eas.json` file defines different build profiles. Each profile specifies the environment variables, platform, and other build-related settings. You can customize these profiles to suit your needs.

**Example: Adding a production build profile:**

Edit your `eas.json` file to include a production build profile:

```plaintext title="eas.json (with production profile)"
{
  "cli": {
    "version": "latest"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk" // or "app-bundle"
      },
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest" // or specify a specific image version
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

- **android.buildType:** Specifies the Android build type (APK or App Bundle). App Bundles are recommended for larger apps.
- **ios.image:** Specifies the iOS build environment image. `latest` is usually fine, but you can specify a specific image version for reproducibility.

### 2. Starting a Build

To start a build, use the following command:

```plaintext
eas build -p android --profile production
# OR
eas build -p ios --profile production
```

- `-p`: Specifies the platform (`android` or `ios`).
- `--profile`: Specifies the build profile defined in `eas.json`.

EAS will upload your project, provision the build environment, and build your app. You can monitor the build progress in your Expo dashboard at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev).

### 3. Code Signing

Code signing is a crucial step in the build process, especially for iOS. EAS handles code signing seamlessly. You have several options:

- **Managed Code Signing (Recommended):** EAS can automatically manage your code signing certificates and provisioning profiles. This is the easiest option. You'll need an Apple Developer account for iOS managed code signing.
- **Manual Code Signing:** You can provide your own certificates and provisioning profiles. This gives you more control but requires more configuration.

EAS CLI will guide you through the code signing setup process during your first build. Follow the prompts to configure code signing for your project.

### 4. Downloading the Build Artifacts

Once the build is complete, you can download the app binaries (APK for Android, IPA for iOS) from the Expo dashboard.

## EAS Update: Pushing Updates Over-the-Air

EAS Update enables you to deploy updates to your app instantly without requiring users to download a new version from the app store. This is incredibly valuable for bug fixes, minor UI changes, and A/B testing.

### 1. Setting Up EAS Update

Ensure your app is configured for updates. This usually involves installing the `expo-updates` package and configuring the `expo` section in your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-updates
```

```plaintext title="app.json (example)"
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "updates": {
      "url": "https://u.expo.dev/[your-project-id]" // This is generated after first publish
    },
    "runtimeVersion": "exposdk:49.0.0" //Recommended. Use correct SDK version
  }
}
```

- **updates.url:** This URL is generated by EAS and points to your update server. It's populated automatically after you publish your first update.
- **runtimeVersion**: Important to specify the correct SDK version to guarantee compatibilty.

### 2. Publishing Updates

To publish an update, use the following command:

```plaintext
eas update
```

This command builds a new JavaScript bundle and uploads it to the EAS Update server.

### 3. Channels

Channels are a crucial concept in EAS Update. They allow you to target specific users or groups with different updates. For example, you can have a "staging" channel for internal testing and a "production" channel for your live users.

You can specify the channel when publishing an update:

```plaintext
eas update --channel staging
```

You can configure different channels in your `eas.json` under the "update" key (if needed, although the command line flag usually suffices).

### 4. Updating the App

To apply an update, your app needs to check for updates and download them. You can use the `Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()` and `Updates.reloadAsync()` functions from the `expo-updates` package.

```plaintext title="App.js (example)"
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates'
import { Platform } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function updateApp() {
      try {
        const update = await Updates.checkForUpdateAsync()
        if (update.isAvailable) {
          await Updates.fetchUpdateAsync()
          await Updates.reloadAsync()
        }
      } catch (e) {
        // Handle errors gracefully
        console.log("Couldn't check for updates", e)
      }
    }

    if (Platform.OS === 'android' || Platform.OS === 'ios') {
      updateApp()
    }
  }, [])

  // Your app code here
  return (
    // Your UI
    <></>
  )
}
```

**Important considerations for updates:**

- **Binary Compatibility:** Updates can only change JavaScript and assets. Native code changes require a new app store submission.
- **CodePush Best Practices:** Similar to CodePush (another popular OTA update solution), avoid making breaking changes in your JavaScript code that would be incompatible with older versions of your app. Use feature flags or version checks to manage these scenarios.
- **A/B Testing:** EAS Update is excellent for A/B testing. Create different channels with different feature sets and direct users to the appropriate channel.
- **Runtime Version**: It is highly recommended to configure the `runtimeVersion` to guarantee compatibily, otherwise updates might break.

## EAS Submit: Submitting to the App Stores

EAS Submit simplifies the process of submitting your app to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

### 1. Configuring EAS Submit

Your `eas.json` file contains a `submit` section. You can configure this section to specify the platform (iOS or Android) and any necessary credentials.

```plaintext title="eas.json (with submit configuration)"
{
  "cli": {
    "version": "latest"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      },
      "ios": {
        "image": "latest"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "./path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json", // Required for Android
        "track": "internal" // Optional (e.g., "alpha", "beta", "production")
      },
      "ios": {
        "appleId": "your.apple.id@example.com", // Optional, but recommended
        "ascApiKeyPath": "./path/to/your/ascApiKey.json" // Required for iOS
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **android.serviceAccountKeyPath:** The path to your Google Play Developer service account key. This is required for submitting to the Google Play Store.
- **android.track:** The track to submit your app to (e.g., "internal", "alpha", "beta", "production").
- **ios.appleId**: Your apple ID.
- **ios.ascApiKeyPath**: The path to your App Store Connect API key. This is required for submitting to the Apple App Store.

### 2. Submitting Your App

To submit your app, use the following command:

```plaintext
eas submit -p android --profile production
# OR
eas submit -p ios --profile production
```

EAS will validate your app, upload it to the appropriate app store, and guide you through the remaining submission steps. You'll still need to provide app metadata (description, screenshots, etc.) in the app store console.

## EAS and CI/CD

EAS integrates well with popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI. You can automate your build and deployment process using EAS commands in your CI/CD pipeline.

**Example: GitHub Actions Workflow**

```plaintext title=".github/workflows/eas-build.yml"
name: EAS Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18 # or your preferred Node.js version

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Install EAS CLI
        run: npm install -g eas-cli

      - name: Build Android
        run: eas build -p android --profile production

      - name: Build iOS
        run: eas build -p ios --profile production

      # Add steps to handle build artifacts (e.g., upload to a distribution service)
```

**Key Considerations for CI/CD Integration:**

- **Authentication:** Securely store your EAS credentials (Expo access token) as secrets in your CI/CD environment.
- **Caching:** Cache dependencies and build artifacts to speed up your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Notifications:** Configure notifications (e.g., Slack, email) to be alerted of build failures or successful deployments.
