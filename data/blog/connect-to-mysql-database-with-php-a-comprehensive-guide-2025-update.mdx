# Connect to MySQL Database with PHP: A Comprehensive Guide (2025 Update)

Connecting to a MySQL database using PHP is a fundamental skill for any web developer.  This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to establish a connection, execute queries, and handle potential errors. We'll cover two primary methods: `mysqli` and `PDO` (PHP Data Objects), showcasing their strengths and weaknesses.  By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped to securely connect to your MySQL database and interact with it effectively using PHP.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **A running MySQL Server:** You can install MySQL Server on your local machine using tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP.  Alternatively, you can connect to a remote MySQL server.
*   **PHP installed and configured:**  Verify that PHP is installed correctly and configured to work with your web server.
*   **MySQLi or PDO extensions enabled:**  Check your `php.ini` file to ensure that either `mysqli` or `PDO_MySQL` extensions are enabled (uncomment the relevant lines by removing the leading semicolon).

## Method 1: Connecting with `mysqli`

The `mysqli` extension is a native PHP extension designed specifically for working with MySQL databases. It offers both procedural and object-oriented interfaces.

### Procedural Style (`mysqli_*` functions)

This style uses functions prefixed with `mysqli_`. While still functional, the object-oriented approach is generally recommended for better code organization.

```php
<?php
// Database credentials
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
$database = "your_database";

// Create connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $database);

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
echo "Connected successfully (Procedural)!";

// Example query
$sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM users";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    // output data of each row
    while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
        echo "<br> id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["firstname"]. " " . $row["lastname"]. "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}


mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Credentials:**  Store your database credentials (`servername`, `username`, `password`, `database`) in variables.  **Never hardcode these directly into your live application.**  Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.
2.  **`mysqli_connect()`:** This function attempts to establish a connection to the MySQL server using the provided credentials.
3.  **Error Handling:**  The `if (!$conn)` block checks if the connection was successful.  If not, `mysqli_connect_error()` returns an error message, and `die()` stops the script execution.  This is crucial for debugging and preventing unexpected behavior.
4.  **`mysqli_query()`:**  Executes the SQL query provided as the second argument. The first argument is the connection object.
5.  **`mysqli_num_rows()`:** Returns the number of rows in the result set.
6.  **`mysqli_fetch_assoc()`:** Fetches a result row as an associative array.
7.  **`mysqli_close()`:** Closes the database connection to release resources.

### Object-Oriented Style (`mysqli` class)

This style utilizes the `mysqli` class, providing a more structured and modern approach.

```php
<?php
// Database credentials
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
$database = "your_database";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $database);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully (Object-Oriented)!";

// Example query
$sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM users";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
    // output data of each row
    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        echo "<br> id: " . $row["id"]. " - Name: " . $row["firstname"]. " " . $row["lastname"]. "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}


$conn->close();
?>
```

**Key Differences from Procedural Style:**

*   **`new mysqli()`:** Creates a new `mysqli` object instead of using a function.
*   **`$conn->connect_error`:**  Accesses the connection error property of the `$conn` object.
*   **`$conn->query()`:**  Calls the `query()` method of the `$conn` object to execute the SQL query.
*   **`$result->num_rows`:**  Accesses the number of rows property of the `$result` object.
*   **`$result->fetch_assoc()`:**  Calls the `fetch_assoc()` method of the `$result` object to fetch the next row.
*   **`$conn->close()`:** Calls the `close()` method on the `$conn` object.

## Method 2: Connecting with PDO (PHP Data Objects)

PDO provides a consistent interface for accessing different database types (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).  This promotes code reusability and makes it easier to switch databases if needed.

```php
<?php
// Database credentials
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
$database = "your_database";

try {
    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=$database", $username, $password);
    // set the PDO error mode to exception
    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
    echo "Connected successfully (PDO)!";

    //Example query
    $sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM users";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->execute();

    // set the resulting array to associative
    $stmt->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    foreach(new RecursiveArrayIterator(new RecursiveIteratorIterator($stmt->fetchAll())) as $k=>$v) {
        echo "<br>". $k . " : ". $v."<br>";
    }
    }
catch(PDOException $e)
    {
    echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
    }
$conn = null;
?>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **DSN (Data Source Name):** The first argument to the `PDO` constructor is the DSN, which specifies the database driver (`mysql`), host (`servername`), and database name (`dbname`).
2.  **Error Handling with `try...catch`:** PDO uses exceptions for error handling. The `try...catch` block allows you to gracefully handle connection errors.  `PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION`  is crucial for enabling exception-based error reporting. This makes debugging significantly easier.
3.  **`setAttribute()`:** Sets attributes on the PDO connection. `PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION` configures PDO to throw exceptions for errors, which are then caught in the `catch` block.
4.  **Prepared Statements (`prepare()` and `execute()`):** While this example doesn't explicitly use bound parameters, prepared statements are **highly recommended** for security reasons (to prevent SQL injection).  The `$conn->prepare($sql)` prepares the SQL statement for execution, and `$stmt->execute()` executes it.
5.   **`setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)`:**  Sets the default fetch mode to associative arrays.
6.  **Fetching Results:** `fetchAll()` fetches all rows as an array.
7.  **Closing the Connection:** `$conn = null;` closes the connection by unsetting the `$conn` variable.

## Security Considerations

*   **SQL Injection:**  Always use prepared statements with bound parameters to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is **especially important** when accepting user input.  PDO provides excellent support for prepared statements.
*   **Storing Credentials:**  Never hardcode your database credentials directly into your script.  Use environment variables or configuration files to store them securely.
*   **Error Reporting:**  While error reporting is essential for debugging, avoid displaying detailed error messages in a production environment, as they can reveal sensitive information.
*   **User Permissions:** Ensure that the database user account has the necessary permissions to perform the required operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and no more.
*   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server, protecting your data and credentials from eavesdropping.

##  Choosing Between `mysqli` and PDO

| Feature          | `mysqli`                                   | PDO                                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Database Support | MySQL only                                  | Multiple database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) |
| API Style        | Procedural and Object-Oriented             | Object-Oriented                             |
| Portability      | Less portable                               | More portable                               |
| Performance     | Generally slightly faster for MySQL-specific tasks | Slightly slower due to abstraction layer      |
| Security        | Requires careful handling to prevent SQL injection | Built-in support for prepared statements     |

**Recommendation:**

*   If you are only working with MySQL and prefer a slightly faster (though often negligible in modern hardware) and more direct approach, `mysqli` is a viable option. However, **always use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.**

*   If you need to support multiple database types or anticipate switching databases in the future, PDO is the preferred choice. Its consistent interface and built-in support for prepared statements make it a more flexible and secure option.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided a detailed overview of how to connect to a MySQL database using PHP with both `mysqli` and PDO. Remember to prioritize security by using prepared statements and properly handling errors. Choose the method that best suits your project requirements and coding style. With a solid understanding of these techniques, you'll be well-equipped to build robust and secure PHP applications that interact with MySQL databases.
