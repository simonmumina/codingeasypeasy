# SQL Server UNICODE() Function: Understanding & Practical Examples for Character Code Conversion

The `UNICODE()` function in SQL Server is a powerful tool for retrieving the Unicode integer value of the first character of a given string. Understanding this function is crucial when dealing with character encoding issues or when you need to perform operations based on the numeric representation of characters. This blog post provides a detailed explanation of the `UNICODE()` function, its syntax, and numerous practical examples to help you leverage it effectively in your SQL Server queries.

## What is the `UNICODE()` Function?

The `UNICODE()` function in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) returns the Unicode integer value for the first character in an input string. Unicode is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique numeric value to each character, allowing for consistent representation of text across different systems and languages. `UNICODE()` allows you to access this underlying numeric representation.

Think of it like a lookup table. You give it a character, and it tells you the numeric code assigned to that character within the Unicode standard.

## Syntax

The syntax for the `UNICODE()` function is straightforward:

```plaintext
UNICODE ( expression )
```

Where:

- `expression`: This is the character string or expression you want to evaluate. It can be a literal string, a column name, or any valid expression that evaluates to a character string.

## Return Value

The `UNICODE()` function returns an integer value representing the Unicode code point of the first character in the `expression`. If the `expression` is `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`.

## Practical Examples with Code

Let's explore some practical examples to illustrate how the `UNICODE()` function works:

**1. Basic Example: Getting the Unicode value of a single character**

```plaintext
SELECT UNICODE('A');  -- Output: 65
SELECT UNICODE('a');  -- Output: 97
SELECT UNICODE('0');  -- Output: 48
```

These examples demonstrate how to retrieve the Unicode values for uppercase 'A', lowercase 'a', and the digit '0'. As you can see, even seemingly simple characters have specific Unicode values.

**2. Using `UNICODE()` with strings**

The `UNICODE()` function only evaluates the _first_ character of the string.

```plaintext
SELECT UNICODE('ABC');  -- Output: 65 (because 'A' is the first character)
SELECT UNICODE('abc');  -- Output: 97 (because 'a' is the first character)
SELECT UNICODE('123');  -- Output: 49 (because '1' is the first character, not '0' as in the previous example)
```

**3. Handling Non-ASCII Characters**

Unicode is especially useful for handling characters outside the ASCII range (0-127).

```plaintext
SELECT UNICODE('é');   -- Output: 233 (Unicode value for the lowercase 'e' with an acute accent)
SELECT UNICODE('你好');  -- Output: 20320 (Unicode value for the Chinese character '你')
```

This illustrates how `UNICODE()` can represent characters from different languages and alphabets.

**4. Using `UNICODE()` with `NULL` values**

```plaintext
SELECT UNICODE(NULL); -- Output: NULL
```

As mentioned earlier, when the input is `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`.

**5. Using `UNICODE()` with Columns in a Table**

This is where the `UNICODE()` function becomes truly powerful. Let's assume you have a table called `Products` with a column called `ProductName`:

```plaintext
-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop'),
(2, 'Keyboard'),
(3, 'Mouse'),
(4, 'écran'); -- French word for screen (with a special character)

-- Retrieve the Unicode value of the first character of each product name
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, UNICODE(ProductName) AS UnicodeValue
FROM Products;

-- Drop the table (clean up)
DROP TABLE Products;
```

This code snippet first creates a sample `Products` table. Then, it inserts some sample data, including a product name with a non-ASCII character ('écran'). Finally, it uses `UNICODE()` to retrieve the Unicode value of the first character of each product name. The query will return a result set similar to this:

| ProductID | ProductName | UnicodeValue |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1         | Laptop      | 76           |
| 2         | Keyboard    | 75           |
| 3         | Mouse       | 77           |
| 4         | écran       | 233          |

**6. Combining `UNICODE()` with other String Functions (e.g., `SUBSTRING()`)**

You can combine `UNICODE()` with other string functions for more complex operations. For example, to get the Unicode value of the _second_ character in a string:

```plaintext
SELECT UNICODE(SUBSTRING('HelloWorld', 2, 1)); -- Output: 101 (Unicode value for 'e')
```

`SUBSTRING('HelloWorld', 2, 1)` extracts the second character ('e') from the string, and then `UNICODE()` returns its Unicode value.

**7. Using `UNICODE()` in `WHERE` clauses**

You can use `UNICODE()` in `WHERE` clauses to filter data based on the Unicode value of characters. For instance, to find all product names in the `Products` table that start with a character whose Unicode value is greater than 100:

```plaintext
-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop'),
(2, 'Keyboard'),
(3, 'Mouse'),
(4, 'écran'); -- French word for screen (with a special character)

SELECT ProductID, ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE UNICODE(ProductName) > 100;

-- Drop the table (clean up)
DROP TABLE Products;
```

This query filters the `Products` table and returns only the rows where the `ProductName` starts with a character whose Unicode value is greater than 100. In this example, the 'écran' would be returned.

**8. Detecting Character Sets**

While not a foolproof method, you can use `UNICODE()` in conjunction with other T-SQL functions to attempt to identify the character set being used in a particular column. This is especially useful when dealing with legacy databases or data sources where the character encoding is not explicitly defined.

```plaintext
-- Example: Checking if a string contains characters outside of the ASCII range
DECLARE @TestString NVARCHAR(255) = N'Hello World! éàç';

IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM STRING_SPLIT(@TestString, '') WHERE UNICODE(value) > 127)
BEGIN
  PRINT 'The string contains characters outside the ASCII range.';
END
ELSE
BEGIN
  PRINT 'The string contains only ASCII characters.';
END
```

**9. Sorting and Ordering by Unicode Values**

You can use `UNICODE()` in the `ORDER BY` clause to sort results based on the Unicode values of the first character in a column. This can be useful for ordering data in a specific linguistic order or when dealing with mixed character sets.

```plaintext
-- Assuming you have a Products table as defined previously
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Insert some sample data (with varying first characters)
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName) VALUES
(1, 'zebra'),
(2, 'apple'),
(3, 'banana'),
(4, '1234');


SELECT ProductID, ProductName
FROM Products
ORDER BY UNICODE(ProductName);

DROP TABLE Products;
```

This will order the products alphabetically based on the Unicode value of the first character, which typically corresponds to alphabetical order for most characters. The digit '1' will likely be ordered before 'a'.

## Considerations and Best Practices

- **`NVARCHAR` vs. `VARCHAR`**: Make sure your column data types are appropriate for the characters you're storing. Use `NVARCHAR` or `NCHAR` when dealing with Unicode data to avoid data loss or corruption. `VARCHAR` is for single-byte character sets.
- **Performance**: While `UNICODE()` is generally efficient, using it extensively in `WHERE` clauses might impact performance. Consider indexing the relevant columns if you frequently filter based on Unicode values.
- **Collation**: Be aware of the collation settings of your database and columns. Collations define the sorting and comparison rules for character data, which can affect how `UNICODE()` is used in conjunction with other functions.
- **Context is Key:** Understanding the purpose and scope of Unicode and its relationship to character encoding is fundamental to using the function effectively.

## Conclusion

The `UNICODE()` function in SQL Server is a versatile tool for working with character data at a fundamental level. By understanding its syntax and capabilities, you can effectively extract the Unicode integer representation of characters, perform advanced string manipulation, and address character encoding challenges in your database applications.
