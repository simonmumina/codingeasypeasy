# Deploying Pyramid Web Applications on AWS Lambda with Zappa (Serverless Guide)

This guide walks you through deploying a Pyramid web application to AWS Lambda using Zappa.  This approach offers a serverless architecture, providing scalability, cost-effectiveness, and reduced operational overhead.  By leveraging AWS Lambda and Zappa, you can focus on building your application rather than managing servers.

## Why Use AWS Lambda and Zappa for Pyramid?

*   **Scalability:** AWS Lambda automatically scales to handle increasing traffic, ensuring your application remains responsive under load.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** You only pay for the compute time your application consumes, leading to significant cost savings compared to traditional server-based deployments.
*   **Reduced Operational Overhead:**  Serverless architecture eliminates the need for server management, patching, and scaling, freeing up your team to focus on development and innovation.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** Zappa simplifies the deployment process, allowing you to deploy your Pyramid application with minimal configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **An AWS Account:** You'll need an active AWS account with appropriate permissions (IAM roles) to create Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and other required resources.
*   **Python 3.7 or higher:**  AWS Lambda supports multiple Python versions.  Choose a version compatible with Pyramid.
*   **Pip:** Python's package installer.
*   **Virtualenv (Recommended):** For isolating project dependencies.  You can use `venv` as an alternative.
*   **Zappa:**  Installed globally or within your virtual environment.  `pip install zappa`
*   **AWS CLI:**  Configured with your AWS credentials. You can configure it using `aws configure`.

## Step 1: Setting up Your Pyramid Application

If you already have a Pyramid application, skip this step. Otherwise, let's create a basic Pyramid application.

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

2.  **Install Pyramid and other dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install pyramid waitress
    ```

3.  **Create a Basic Pyramid Application (e.g., `tutorial.py`):**

    ```python
    from pyramid.config import Configurator
    from pyramid.response import Response

    def hello_world(request):
        return Response('Hello, World from Pyramid on Lambda!')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Configurator() as config:
            config.add_route('hello', '/')
            config.add_view(hello_world, route_name='hello')
            app = config.make_wsgi_app()

        from waitress import serve
        serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=6543)
    ```

4.  **Create a `__init__.py` file in the same directory (if it doesn't exist).** This makes the directory a Python package.

5.  **Test your application locally:**

    ```bash
    python tutorial.py  # Replace 'tutorial.py' with your main application file
    ```

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6543` (or the port you specified). You should see "Hello, World from Pyramid on Lambda!".

## Step 2: Configuring Zappa

Zappa uses a `zappa_settings.json` file to configure deployment parameters.  Create this file in the root directory of your Pyramid application.

```json
{
    "dev": {
        "app_function": "tutorial.app",  // Replace 'tutorial' with your main application file name
        "aws_region": "us-east-1",        // Choose your AWS region
        "profile_name": "default",      // Your AWS CLI profile name
        "project_name": "pyramid-lambda",  // Your project name
        "runtime": "python3.9",          //  Choose your Python runtime. MUST match your local.
        "s3_bucket": "your-unique-s3-bucket-name", // Replace with a unique S3 bucket name
        "slim_handler": true,
        "wsgi_path": "tutorial.app"    //Replace with your application path
    }
}
```

**Explanation of `zappa_settings.json` parameters:**

*   `app_function`:  The WSGI application object within your Pyramid application file. In the example above, `tutorial.app` means the `app` object in `tutorial.py`. We need to slightly modify the `tutorial.py` file (shown below) to ensure the app is accessible this way.
*   `aws_region`: The AWS region where you want to deploy your application.
*   `profile_name`: The AWS CLI profile to use for authentication.
*   `project_name`:  A name for your project. This is used in Lambda function names, API Gateway names, and other AWS resources.
*   `runtime`: The Python runtime to use for your Lambda function. Ensure it matches your local Python version and the versions supported by AWS Lambda.
*   `s3_bucket`: A unique S3 bucket name where Zappa will upload your application code and dependencies.  **Important:** This bucket must already exist or Zappa will create it. Make sure the bucket name is globally unique.
*   `slim_handler`:  Optimizes the deployment package by only including necessary dependencies. Setting this to `true` is generally recommended.
*    `wsgi_path`: The path to your WSGI application, similar to app_function but used by the WSGI container.

**Modify your Pyramid application (`tutorial.py`) to expose the `app` variable:**

```python
from pyramid.config import Configurator
from pyramid.response import Response

def hello_world(request):
    return Response('Hello, World from Pyramid on Lambda!')

with Configurator() as config:
    config.add_route('hello', '/')
    config.add_view(hello_world, route_name='hello')
    app = config.make_wsgi_app()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    from waitress import serve
    serve(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=6543)
```

**Important:**  Ensure the `app` variable is defined outside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.  This is crucial for Zappa to find and use your Pyramid application.

## Step 3: Initialize Zappa

Navigate to the root directory of your Pyramid application in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
zappa init
```

Zappa will guide you through the initialization process, asking questions about your deployment configuration. If you have already created the `zappa_settings.json` file, you can largely accept the defaults. This step isn't strictly necessary if you already have a `zappa_settings.json` file, but running `zappa init` can help you verify your settings and create a basic configuration.

## Step 4: Deploying to AWS Lambda

Now you're ready to deploy your Pyramid application! Run the following command:

```bash
zappa deploy dev
```

Replace "dev" with the environment name you defined in your `zappa_settings.json` file (e.g., "production", "staging").

Zappa will:

1.  Package your application code and dependencies.
2.  Upload the package to your specified S3 bucket.
3.  Create a Lambda function in your AWS account.
4.  Configure an API Gateway endpoint to trigger your Lambda function.
5.  Output the API Gateway URL, which you can use to access your deployed Pyramid application.

The deployment process may take a few minutes.  Pay attention to the output in your terminal for any errors or warnings.

## Step 5: Testing Your Deployed Application

Once the deployment is complete, Zappa will output the API Gateway URL.  Copy this URL and paste it into your web browser.  You should see the same "Hello, World from Pyramid on Lambda!" message, but this time it's being served by your Pyramid application running on AWS Lambda.

## Step 6: Updating Your Application

When you make changes to your application, you can redeploy it using the `zappa update` command:

```bash
zappa update dev
```

This will update the Lambda function with your latest code.

## Step 7: Undeploying Your Application

To remove your deployed application and associated AWS resources, use the `zappa undeploy` command:

```bash
zappa undeploy dev
```

This will delete the Lambda function, API Gateway endpoint, and other resources created by Zappa.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

*   **"Unable to import module" errors:** This usually indicates that Zappa can't find your application's entry point (the `app` variable). Double-check the `app_function` and `wsgi_path` settings in `zappa_settings.json` and ensure your application exposes the `app` variable correctly.  Also, confirm that all dependencies are correctly installed in your virtual environment.
*   **IAM Permissions:** Ensure that the IAM role associated with your AWS CLI profile has the necessary permissions to create Lambda functions, S3 buckets, API Gateway endpoints, and other required resources. You can create a new IAM role with the `AWSLambdaFullAccess` policy (for testing purposes; use more restrictive policies in production).
*   **Lambda Function Timeout:** The default Lambda function timeout is 3 seconds. If your application takes longer to respond, you may need to increase the timeout value in `zappa_settings.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "dev": {
            "app_function": "tutorial.app",
            "aws_region": "us-east-1",
            "profile_name": "default",
            "project_name": "pyramid-lambda",
            "runtime": "python3.9",
            "s3_bucket": "your-unique-s3-bucket-name",
            "slim_handler": true,
            "wsgi_path": "tutorial.app",
            "timeout": 30 //Increased timeout to 30 seconds
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Package Size Limits:** AWS Lambda has limits on the size of deployment packages. If your application has many dependencies, you may exceed these limits.  Consider using `slim_handler: true` in your `zappa_settings.json` file to reduce the package size.  Alternatively, you can use Lambda Layers to share dependencies across multiple functions.
*   **Error Logs:** Check the CloudWatch logs for your Lambda function to troubleshoot errors. You can find the CloudWatch logs in the AWS Management Console.  The log group will typically be named `/aws/lambda/your-lambda-function-name`.
*   **Database Connections:** If your Pyramid application connects to a database, make sure your database is accessible from the Lambda function. This may require configuring security groups or using a VPC.
*   **Zappa Version:** Ensure you have the latest version of Zappa installed.  `pip install --upgrade zappa`

## Conclusion

Deploying Pyramid applications to AWS Lambda with Zappa offers a powerful way to build scalable, cost-effective, and serverless web applications.  By following this guide, you can quickly deploy your Pyramid applications and take advantage of the benefits of serverless computing. Remember to carefully configure your `zappa_settings.json` file, handle dependencies correctly, and monitor your application's logs for any issues. Happy deploying!
