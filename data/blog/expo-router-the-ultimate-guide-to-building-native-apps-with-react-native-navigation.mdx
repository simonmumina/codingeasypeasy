# Expo Router: The Ultimate Guide to Building Native Apps with React Native Navigation

Expo Router has revolutionized React Native development, offering a simplified and powerful approach to navigation and routing within native mobile applications. This guide dives deep into Expo Router, exploring its features, benefits, and how to effectively leverage it to build complex and performant cross-platform apps.

## What is Expo Router?

Expo Router is a file-based routing system built on top of React Navigation, specifically designed for Expo applications. It allows you to define your app's navigation structure directly through your project's file system, making it intuitive and easy to manage. Think of it as the Next.js file-based routing, but for React Native.

**Key Advantages of Expo Router:**

- **File-Based Routing:** Define your app's navigation structure directly in your file system. No more complex navigation configurations!
- **Automatic Linking:** Expo Router automatically handles deep linking, making it easy to share links that take users directly to specific screens within your app.
- **Universal Apps:** Build truly universal apps that run natively on iOS, Android, and the web (with Expo Web).
- **Optimized for Performance:** Expo Router leverages React Navigation under the hood, ensuring smooth transitions and optimal performance.
- **Easy to Learn and Use:** If you're familiar with React and file-based routing concepts, you'll pick up Expo Router quickly.
- **Hot Reloading:** Enjoy a fast development loop with hot reloading, seeing your changes reflected instantly in your app.
- **SEO Friendly (for Web):** When used with Expo Web, your app's routes are SEO-friendly, improving discoverability.

## Getting Started with Expo Router

Let's dive into setting up Expo Router in a new Expo project.

**1. Create a new Expo Project:**

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app my-expo-router-app --template tabs
cd my-expo-router-app
```

The `--template tabs` flag bootstraps your app with a basic tab navigation structure, allowing you to see Expo Router in action immediately. You can also use `blank` or other templates based on your needs.

**2. Understanding the File Structure:**

After creating your project, you'll find a directory named `app`. This is where Expo Router does its magic. The file structure within this directory directly corresponds to your app's navigation.

- **`app/_layout.js` (or `.tsx`):** This is the root layout file. It wraps your entire application and defines the overall navigation structure (e.g., tab navigation, stack navigation). This is a crucial file for setting up the core navigation component.

- **`app/index.js` (or `.tsx`):** This is the default route (equivalent to `/` in web development). It's the screen users see when they first open your app.

- **`app/settings.js` (or `.tsx`):** This will be a route corresponding to `/settings`.

- **`app/users/[id].js` (or `.tsx`):** This is a dynamic route. `[id]` is a route parameter. Visiting `/users/123` will render this component with `id` set to "123".

**3. Running Your App:**

```plaintext
npx expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server. You can then run your app on a physical device or simulator using the Expo Go app or with an emulator.

## Core Concepts and Code Examples

Let's explore some of the core concepts of Expo Router and how to implement them.

**1. Layout Routes (`_layout.js` / `_layout.tsx`):**

Layout routes are the cornerstone of Expo Router's navigation structure. They define the shared UI and navigation components that wrap specific routes or groups of routes.

**Example: `app/_layout.js` (Tab Navigation)**

```javascript
import { Tabs } from 'expo-router'

export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="index"
        options={{
          tabBarLabel: 'Home',
          title: 'Home Screen', //  Screen title
        }}
      />
      <Tabs.Screen
        name="settings"
        options={{
          tabBarLabel: 'Settings',
          title: 'Settings Screen',
        }}
      />
    </Tabs>
  )
}
```

In this example, we're using the `Tabs` component from `expo-router` to create a bottom tab navigator. Each `Tabs.Screen` defines a tab. The `name` prop corresponds to the filename (without the extension) within the `app` directory. The `options` prop allows you to customize the tab bar label, title, and other properties.

**2. Stack Navigation:**

To create a stack navigator (for pushing and popping screens), you can use the `Stack` component within a layout route.

**Example: `app/users/_layout.js` (Stack Navigation within a Tab)**

```javascript
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'

export default function UsersLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen
        name="index" // users/index.js
        options={{ title: 'User List' }}
      />
      <Stack.Screen
        name="[id]" // users/[id].js
        options={{ title: 'User Details' }}
      />
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

This example defines a stack navigator for the `users` route. `users/index.js` will display a list of users, and tapping on a user will push the `users/[id].js` screen onto the stack, displaying the user's details.

**3. Navigation using `useRouter` Hook:**

The `useRouter` hook provides access to navigation methods within your components.

**Example: Navigating to a Different Route**

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router'
import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native'

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button title="Go to Settings" onPress={() => router.push('/settings')} />
      <Button title="Go to User Details (ID: 123)" onPress={() => router.push('/users/123')} />
    </View>
  )
}
```

In this example, we're using `router.push()` to navigate to different routes. `router.push('/settings')` navigates to the `settings` screen, and `router.push('/users/123')` navigates to the dynamic user details screen with the ID "123".

**Other helpful router methods include:**

- `router.replace()`: Replaces the current route in the history stack.
- `router.back()`: Goes back to the previous screen.
- `router.reload()`: Refreshes the current route.

**4. Accessing Route Parameters:**

For dynamic routes (e.g., `app/users/[id].js`), you can access the route parameters using the `useLocalSearchParams` hook.

**Example: `app/users/[id].js`**

```javascript
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

export default function UserDetailsScreen() {
  const { id } = useLocalSearchParams()

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>User Details for ID: {id}</Text>
      {/* Fetch user data based on the ID */}
    </View>
  )
}
```

This component retrieves the `id` parameter from the URL (e.g., `/users/123`) using `useLocalSearchParams` and displays it. You would typically use this ID to fetch user data from an API or local storage.

**5. Deep Linking:**

Expo Router automatically handles deep linking. To set up deep linking:

1.  **Configure `app.json` (or `app.config.js`)**: Add a `scheme` to your app configuration.

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "my-expo-router-app",
        "slug": "my-expo-router-app",
        "scheme": "myapp" // Define your deep link scheme
        // ... other configurations
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Use the Scheme in Your Links:**

    Now you can use links like `myapp://users/123` to directly open the user details screen within your app. Expo Router will automatically handle navigating to the correct screen based on the URL.

**6. Conditional Routing:**

You can use conditional rendering in your `_layout.js` files to dynamically adjust the navigation based on user authentication or other factors.

**Example: Conditional Authentication Check**

```javascript
import { useRouter, Redirect } from 'expo-router'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { checkAuthStatus } from '../utils/auth' // Replace with your authentication logic

export default function Layout() {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkAuthentication = async () => {
      const authStatus = await checkAuthStatus()
      setIsAuthenticated(authStatus)
      setLoading(false)
    }

    checkAuthentication()
  }, [])

  if (loading) {
    return null // Or a loading spinner
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // Redirect to the login page.  Ensure a login route exists (e.g., `/login`).
    return <Redirect href="/login" />
  }

  // If authenticated, render the main app layout (e.g., Tab navigation)
  return (
    // Your Tab or Stack Navigation Component
    // Example:
    // <Tabs>...</Tabs>
    null //Replace with your actual Tab or Stack Navigation component
  )
}
```

This example checks the user's authentication status using a hypothetical `checkAuthStatus` function. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects them to the login page. Remember to replace `checkAuthStatus` with your actual authentication logic and create a `/login` route.

## Advanced Topics

**1. Expo Web Support:**

Expo Router works seamlessly with Expo Web, allowing you to build web versions of your React Native apps with minimal code changes. Simply run `npx expo start --web` to build and serve your app in the browser. When used with Expo Web, Expo Router provides proper URL routing and SEO benefits for your web app.

**2. Expo SDK Integration:**

Expo Router integrates seamlessly with the Expo SDK, making it easy to use Expo's powerful APIs for things like accessing device sensors, push notifications, and more.

**3. Custom Navigation Components:**

While Expo Router provides built-in navigation components like `Tabs` and `Stack`, you can also integrate custom navigation components from React Navigation or other libraries if you need more advanced features.

**4. Handling State Management:**

Consider using a state management library like Redux, Zustand, or Jotai to manage your app's state, especially for complex applications with shared data between components. React Context is also a valid approach for smaller apps.

## Best Practices

- **Plan Your Navigation Structure:** Before you start coding, take the time to plan out your app's navigation structure. Sketch it out, and think about how users will navigate between different screens.
- **Keep Your `_layout.js` Files Clean:** Avoid putting too much logic directly in your `_layout.js` files. Extract complex logic into separate components or hooks.
- **Use Descriptive Route Names:** Use clear and descriptive route names to make your file structure easy to understand and maintain.
- **Leverage Type Safety (TypeScript):** Use TypeScript to improve the maintainability and reliability of your code.
- **Optimize Performance:** Be mindful of performance, especially when dealing with large lists or complex components. Use techniques like memoization and virtualization to optimize rendering.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your navigation thoroughly on different devices and platforms to ensure a consistent user experience.
- **Implement Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent your app from crashing.
