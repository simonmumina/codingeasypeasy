# Create Custom Nitro Server Middleware in Nuxt 3: A Comprehensive Guide

Nuxt 3 leverages [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), a powerful server engine that allows you to build universal applications with ease. One of the key features of Nitro is its support for **server middleware**, which provides a way to intercept and modify incoming requests and outgoing responses at the server level. This is incredibly useful for tasks like authentication, logging, request validation, and more.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into how to create custom Nitro server middleware in Nuxt 3, covering everything from basic setup to more advanced use cases.

## What is Nitro Server Middleware?

Server middleware in Nuxt 3 allows you to execute code on the server before or after a request is handled by your Nuxt application. It's a fundamental building block for adding custom server-side logic without writing separate API routes for everything. Middleware functions can:

- **Inspect and modify requests:** Access request headers, query parameters, body, and more.
- **Modify responses:** Set response headers, change the response body, or redirect the user.
- **Perform authentication and authorization:** Verify user credentials before allowing access to certain routes.
- **Log requests:** Record information about incoming requests for debugging and monitoring.
- **Implement caching:** Cache responses to improve performance.
- **Handle errors:** Catch and handle errors that occur during request processing.

## Getting Started with Server Middleware in Nuxt 3

Creating custom Nitro server middleware in Nuxt 3 is surprisingly straightforward. Here's how to get started:

1.  **Create the `server/middleware` directory:** If it doesn't already exist, create a `server/middleware` directory at the root of your Nuxt 3 project. This directory is where you'll store your middleware files.

2.  **Create a middleware file:** Inside the `server/middleware` directory, create a `.ts` (or `.js`) file for your middleware. The filename will determine the route where the middleware will apply (more on this later). For example, let's create a file named `0.logging.ts`. The leading `0.` is important because it dictates the _order_ in which middleware is executed. Lower numbers run first.

3.  **Define your middleware function:** Inside your middleware file, export a default function that accepts three arguments:

    - `req`: The [H3Event](https://github.com/unjs/h3) request object, providing access to request information.
    - `res`: The [H3Event](https://github.com/unjs/h3) response object, allowing you to modify the response. It's the same H3Event passed as `req`.
    - `next`: An optional function to call the next middleware in the chain. If you don't call `next()`, the request will not be passed on to subsequent middleware or the route handler. You don't generally need `next()` in newer Nuxt versions, as all middleware is chained automatically.

Here's a basic example:

```plaintext
// server/middleware/0.logging.ts
import { defineEventHandler, getRequestHeader } from 'h3';

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const userAgent = getRequestHeader(event, 'user-agent') || 'Unknown';
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] Request from: ${userAgent}`);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `defineEventHandler` and `getRequestHeader` from the `h3` package. `h3` is the underlying HTTP handler library used by Nitro.
- `defineEventHandler` is a helper function that ensures proper type checking and auto-completion for your middleware function.
- `getRequestHeader(event, 'user-agent')` retrieves the User-Agent header from the request.
- We log a message to the console with the timestamp and the User-Agent. This simple middleware logs every incoming request.

**Important Notes:**

- **Naming Convention:** Middleware files are automatically loaded and executed based on their filename. The filename determines the route that the middleware applies to.

  - Files with a name like `middleware.ts` or `middleware.js` will run for _every_ route in your application.
  - Files with names like `[routeName].ts` or `[routeName].js` will only run for routes that match `routeName`. The route name is relative to the `pages` directory. Therefore `server/middleware/users.ts` would only be run when calling a route like `/users`
  - Numerical prefixes like `0.` control the execution order, with lower numbers executing first. This is important if you have multiple middleware that depend on each other.

- **Automatic Loading:** Nuxt 3 automatically discovers and loads all middleware files in the `server/middleware` directory. You don't need to explicitly import or register them.

## Example: Applying Middleware to a Specific Route

Let's create a middleware that only applies to routes under `/api`. Create a file named `server/middleware/api.ts` (or `api.js`):

```plaintext
// server/middleware/api.ts
import { defineEventHandler, setResponseStatus } from 'h3';

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const apiKey = event.node.req.headers['x-api-key']; // Accessing the raw Node.js request object for headers

  if (apiKey !== 'YOUR_API_KEY') {
    console.log('Unauthorized access attempt to /api');
    setResponseStatus(event, 401);
    return 'Unauthorized'; // Early return prevents further processing
  }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- This middleware checks for an `X-API-KEY` header in the request.
- If the API key is missing or incorrect, it sets the response status to 401 (Unauthorized) and returns a "Unauthorized" message.
- The important part is that this middleware will only be executed for routes that start with `/api`. For example: `/api/users`, `/api/products`.

**Important:** Returning a value from the middleware handler will stop the execution of the request. This is a crucial pattern for authentication and authorization. Make sure to set the appropriate HTTP status code using `setResponseStatus`.

## Accessing the Request and Response Objects

The `req` (or `event`) and `res` objects in the middleware function provide access to the underlying Node.js request and response objects. However, Nuxt 3 uses the `h3` library, which provides a more convenient and type-safe API for working with requests and responses.

Here's a breakdown of how to access different parts of the request:

- **Request Headers:** Use `getRequestHeader(event, headerName)` to get a specific header. For example: `getRequestHeader(event, 'user-agent')`. To access the headers object you can use `event.node.req.headers`.
- **Request Query Parameters:** Use `getQuery(event)` to get an object containing the query parameters. For example: `const query = getQuery(event); console.log(query.id);`.
- **Request Body:** Use `readBody(event)` to read the request body as a string or parsed JSON object. This is an asynchronous operation, so you'll need to use `await`. For example: `const body = await readBody(event);`. You can also use `readRawBody(event)` to read the raw request body as a string.

Here's an example of accessing the request body:

```plaintext
// server/middleware/body-parser.ts
import { defineEventHandler, readBody } from 'h3';

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  try {
    const body = await readBody(event);
    console.log('Request Body:', body);
    // You can now access properties of the body object if it's JSON
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error parsing request body:', error);
  }
});
```

## Modifying the Response

You can modify the response in your middleware by setting response headers, the response body, or the response status code.

- **Set Response Headers:** Use `setHeader(event, headerName, headerValue)` to set a response header. For example: `setHeader(event, 'Cache-Control', 'no-cache');`.
- **Set Response Status:** Use `setResponseStatus(event, statusCode)` to set the HTTP response status code. For example: `setResponseStatus(event, 404);`.
- **Set Response Body:** Returning a value from the middleware handler will set it as the response body, but it's more explicit to use `return send(event, 'Your Custom Body')` which is the modern way. You can also use `return sendError(event, createError({ statusCode: 500, statusMessage: 'Server Error' }))` to send an error response. The old way of using `res.end()` is still an option using `event.node.res.end()`, but it is not recommended.
- **Redirect the User:** Use `sendRedirect(event, url)` to redirect the user to a different URL. For example: `sendRedirect(event, '/login');`.

Here's an example of setting a custom response header and body:

```plaintext
// server/middleware/custom-response.ts
import { defineEventHandler, setHeader, send } from 'h3';

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  setHeader(event, 'X-Custom-Header', 'My Custom Value');
  return send(event, 'Custom Response from Middleware');
});
```

## Advanced Use Cases

Here are some more advanced use cases for Nitro server middleware:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication logic to verify user credentials and protect specific routes. Use middleware to check for valid JWT tokens or session cookies.

```plaintext
// server/middleware/auth.ts
import { defineEventHandler, getRequestHeader, sendError, createError } from 'h3';
import { verifyToken } from '../utils/auth'; // Assuming you have a verifyToken function

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const token = getRequestHeader(event, 'authorization')?.split(' ')[1];

  if (!token) {
    return sendError(event, createError({ statusCode: 401, statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: Missing token' }));
  }

  try {
    const user = await verifyToken(token); // Verify the token (e.g., JWT)
    // Store the user in the request context for later use in route handlers
    event.context.user = user;
  } catch (error) {
    return sendError(event, createError({ statusCode: 401, statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: Invalid token' }));
  }
});
```

- **Request Validation:** Validate incoming request data to ensure that it meets your application's requirements. Use middleware to check for required fields, data types, and valid values.

```plaintext
// server/middleware/validate-user.ts
import { defineEventHandler, readBody, sendError, createError } from 'h3';

interface UserData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function isValidUserData(data: any): data is UserData {
  return (
    typeof data === 'object' &&
    data !== null &&
    typeof data.name === 'string' &&
    data.name.trim() !== '' &&
    typeof data.email === 'string' &&
    data.email.includes('@')
  );
}

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  if (event.path !== '/api/users') return; // Only validate for /api/users

  const body = await readBody(event);

  if (!isValidUserData(body)) {
    return sendError(event, createError({ statusCode: 400, statusMessage: 'Bad Request: Invalid user data' }));
  }

  // If the data is valid, you can proceed with processing the request
  console.log('Valid user data:', body);
});
```

- **Logging and Monitoring:** Log request information (e.g., URL, IP address, headers) for debugging and monitoring purposes.

```plaintext
// server/middleware/request-logger.ts
import { defineEventHandler, getRequestURL } from 'h3';

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const url = getRequestURL(event);
  const ipAddress = event.node.req.socket.remoteAddress || 'Unknown'; // Access the raw socket

  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] Request: ${url} from ${ipAddress}`);
  // You can also log to a file or external monitoring service
});
```

- **Feature Flags:** Implement feature flags to enable or disable certain features based on user roles, environment variables, or other criteria.

```plaintext
// server/middleware/feature-flag.ts
import { defineEventHandler, getQuery } from 'h3';

const isFeatureEnabled = (featureName: string): boolean => {
  // Logic to determine if a feature is enabled (e.g., check environment variables)
  const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    NEW_DASHBOARD: process.env.NEW_DASHBOARD === 'true',
  };
  return FEATURE_FLAGS[featureName] || false;
};

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const query = getQuery(event);

  if (query.feature && !isFeatureEnabled(query.feature as string)) {
     console.log(`Feature flag "${query.feature}" is disabled.`);
     return; // Optionally, redirect or show a message
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Middleware Concise:** Middleware functions should be focused and perform a specific task. Avoid writing overly complex middleware that does too much.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in environment variables and access them in your middleware.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Catch and handle errors in your middleware to prevent unexpected crashes or disruptions.
- **Test Your Middleware:** Write unit tests for your middleware to ensure that it behaves as expected.
- **Order Matters:** Remember the order in which your middleware is executed is very important, especially when using a globally registered middleware.
