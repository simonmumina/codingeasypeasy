# Create Smooth Scrolling with CSS: A Comprehensive Guide

Smooth scrolling, the effect of gracefully animating the scroll position of a webpage, can significantly enhance the user experience. It provides a more fluid and polished feel compared to the jarring jump associated with standard scrolling. This guide will walk you through different methods to achieve smooth scrolling using CSS, focusing on the `scroll-behavior` property, accessibility considerations, and practical code examples.

## Why Use Smooth Scrolling?

- **Improved User Experience:** Smooth transitions make navigation feel more natural and engaging.
- **Professional Look and Feel:** Adds a touch of sophistication to your website design.
- **Easier to Follow:** Especially beneficial for long-form content and one-page websites where users frequently navigate between sections.

## The `scroll-behavior` Property: The Easiest Solution

The simplest way to implement smooth scrolling is by using the CSS `scroll-behavior` property. This property specifies the scrolling behavior for the scrolling box.

### Setting up Basic Smooth Scrolling

To enable smooth scrolling for the entire page, apply the `scroll-behavior` property to the `html` element:

```plaintext
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

This single line of CSS will instruct the browser to animate the scroll when users click on anchor links or use the keyboard to navigate.

### Specific Element Scrolling

You can also apply `scroll-behavior` to specific scrollable elements:

```plaintext
.scrollable-div {
  overflow: auto; /* Or overflow: scroll; */
  height: 300px;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

This will only enable smooth scrolling within the element with the class `scrollable-div`. Make sure the element is actually scrollable by setting `overflow` to `auto` or `scroll`.

## Anchor Links and Smooth Scrolling

Smooth scrolling is most effective when used with anchor links. Anchor links allow users to jump to specific sections within a page. These are created using the `<a>` tag and the `href` attribute pointing to an element ID.

### Example HTML Structure

```plaintext
<h1>Main Content</h1>

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<section id="section1">
  <h2>Section 1</h2>
  <p>Content for section 1...</p>
</section>

<section id="section2">
  <h2>Section 2</h2>
  <p>Content for section 2...</p>
</section>

<section id="section3">
  <h2>Section 3</h2>
  <p>Content for section 3...</p>
</section>
```

When a user clicks on a link in the navigation, the browser will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section. With the `scroll-behavior: smooth` declaration in place, the transition is animated instead of being a direct jump.

## Accessibility Considerations

While smooth scrolling enhances the user experience for many, it's crucial to consider its impact on accessibility.

### Respecting User Preferences

Some users might have reduced motion preferences set in their operating system for accessibility reasons. It's vital to respect these settings. We can use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable smooth scrolling for these users.

```plaintext
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  html {
    scroll-behavior: auto; /* Or initial */
  }
}
```

This code snippet ensures that users who have explicitly chosen to reduce motion are not subjected to smooth scrolling animations. `scroll-behavior: auto` reverts to the default browser behavior (instant scroll). `scroll-behavior: initial` does the same.

### Keyboard Navigation

Ensure that keyboard navigation remains intuitive and functional. Smooth scrolling should not interfere with the user's ability to navigate the page using the Tab key and other keyboard controls. Pay attention to focus states of your elements.

### Screen Readers

Test your website with a screen reader to ensure that smooth scrolling doesn't negatively affect the screen reader's ability to navigate and interpret the content. Properly structured HTML and semantic elements will help screen readers understand the content and its relationship to anchor links.

## Advanced Techniques (Beyond `scroll-behavior`)

While `scroll-behavior: smooth` is the recommended and easiest approach, there are alternative methods you can use, especially if you need more control over the animation or support older browsers (although browser support for `scroll-behavior` is excellent these days).

### Using JavaScript with `window.scrollTo()`

You can use JavaScript to create custom smooth scrolling animations. This approach allows you to fine-tune the animation's duration, easing function, and other parameters. Libraries like `gsap` or `anime.js` can simplify the process.

Here's a basic example using `window.scrollTo()`:

```plaintext
const scrollLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]')

scrollLinks.forEach((link) => {
  link.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
    e.preventDefault()

    const targetId = this.getAttribute('href')
    const targetElement = document.querySelector(targetId)

    if (targetElement) {
      window.scrollTo({
        top: targetElement.offsetTop,
        behavior: 'smooth', //This is still using the browser's built-in smooth scrolling
      })
    }
  })
})
```

This code snippet selects all anchor links, prevents the default link behavior, and uses `window.scrollTo()` to animate the scroll position. Note the use of `behavior: 'smooth'` again â€“ even in JavaScript, you can leverage the browser's built-in functionality.

**Custom Animation with `requestAnimationFrame()`**

For complete control over the animation, you can use `requestAnimationFrame()` to create a custom smooth scrolling function:

```plaintext
function smoothScroll(target, duration) {
  let targetElement = document.querySelector(target)
  let start = window.pageYOffset
  let startTime = performance.now()

  function animation(currentTime) {
    let timeElapsed = currentTime - startTime
    let run = ease(timeElapsed, start, targetElement.offsetTop - start, duration)
    window.scrollTo(0, run)
    if (timeElapsed < duration) requestAnimationFrame(animation)
  }

  function ease(t, b, c, d) {
    // Linear easing function
    t /= d
    return c * t + b
  }

  requestAnimationFrame(animation)
}

const scrollLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]')

scrollLinks.forEach((link) => {
  link.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
    e.preventDefault()
    const targetId = this.getAttribute('href')
    smoothScroll(targetId, 500) // Adjust duration (in milliseconds) as needed
  })
})
```

This example uses `requestAnimationFrame()` to update the scroll position repeatedly over a specified duration. The `ease` function defines the easing curve (e.g., linear, ease-in-out). You can replace the linear easing function with more sophisticated easing functions for a more visually appealing animation.

## Choosing the Right Method

- **`scroll-behavior: smooth`:** The recommended approach for most situations due to its simplicity and browser support. Don't forget the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
- **JavaScript with `window.scrollTo()`:** Useful when you need a little more control, but still want to rely on the browser's smooth scrolling implementation.
- **JavaScript with `requestAnimationFrame()`:** Provides the most flexibility and control but requires more code. Ideal for complex animations or when you need to support very old browsers.

## Conclusion

Implementing smooth scrolling is a simple yet effective way to enhance the user experience on your website. By using the `scroll-behavior` property, you can easily add this feature with minimal code. Remember to prioritize accessibility by respecting user preferences and ensuring that keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility are maintained. Whether you opt for the simplicity of CSS or the flexibility of JavaScript, smooth scrolling can contribute to a more engaging and user-friendly website.
