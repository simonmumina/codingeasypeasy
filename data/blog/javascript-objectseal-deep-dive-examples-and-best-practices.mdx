# JavaScript Object.seal(): Deep Dive, Examples & Best Practices

JavaScript provides several methods for controlling the mutability of objects. Among these, `Object.seal()` stands out as a crucial tool for securing your code and preventing unintended modifications. This comprehensive guide explores `Object.seal()` in detail, covering its functionality, differences from other methods like `Object.freeze()`, practical examples, and best practices.

## What is `Object.seal()`?

`Object.seal()` is a JavaScript method that _seals_ an object. This means that it prevents new properties from being added to the object and marks all existing properties as non-configurable. Crucially, unlike `Object.freeze()`, existing properties can still be changed (if they are writable) after the object is sealed. In essence, `Object.seal()` ensures the _structure_ of the object remains fixed, while allowing for modifications of its _values_ (under certain conditions).

## How `Object.seal()` Works:

1. **Prevents Adding New Properties:** You cannot add new properties to a sealed object. Any attempt to do so will either silently fail in non-strict mode or throw a `TypeError` in strict mode.

2. **Marks Existing Properties as Non-Configurable:** This is the core of `Object.seal()`. Making a property non-configurable prevents it from being deleted or having its attributes (like `writable`, `enumerable`, or `configurable` itself) changed. This means you can't use `delete obj.property` or `Object.defineProperty()` to alter the structure of the object.

3. **Existing Writable Properties Can Still Be Modified:** This is a key difference from `Object.freeze()`. If a property is writable _before_ sealing the object, it remains writable after sealing. You can still change the value of that property.

4. **Existing Non-Writable Properties Cannot Be Modified:** If a property is already non-writable _before_ sealing, it remains non-writable. You cannot change its value.

## Code Examples:

Let's illustrate `Object.seal()` with some practical examples:

**Example 1: Sealing a Simple Object**

```plaintext
// Non-strict mode
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};

Object.seal(person);

// Attempt to add a new property:
person.city = "New York"; // This will silently fail in non-strict mode

console.log(person); // Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 30 } (no city property added)

// Attempt to delete an existing property:
delete person.age; // This will silently fail

console.log(person); // Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 30 } (age property still exists)

// Modify an existing property (since it was writable):
person.name = "Bob";

console.log(person); // Output: { name: 'Bob', age: 30 } (name property changed)
```

**Example 2: Using `Object.seal()` in Strict Mode**

```plaintext
"use strict";

const product = {
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 1200,
};

Object.seal(product);

try {
  product.discount = 0.1; // Attempt to add a new property
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot add property discount, object is not extensible
}

try {
  delete product.price;  // Attempt to delete an existing property
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot delete property 'price' of [object Object]
}

product.price = 1300; // Modify an existing writable property
console.log(product); // Output: { name: 'Laptop', price: 1300 }

// Define a non-writable property before sealing
Object.defineProperty(product, 'name', { writable: false });

Object.seal(product);

try {
    product.name = "Tablet"; // Try to modify a non-writable property
} catch(error) {
    console.error("Error:", error); //Output: TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'name' of object '#<Object>'
}

console.log(product); // Output: { name: 'Laptop', price: 1300 }
```

**Example 3: Sealing with Nested Objects**

`Object.seal()` only applies shallowly. If an object contains other objects as properties, those nested objects are _not_ automatically sealed. You need to explicitly seal them as well, if desired.

```plaintext
const company = {
  name: "Acme Corp",
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
  },
};

Object.seal(company);

// You cannot add properties directly to 'company':
// company.employees = 100;  // Fails (silently or throws TypeError)

// But you *can* still modify properties of the nested 'address' object:
company.address.city = "New City";

console.log(company); // Output: { name: 'Acme Corp', address: { street: '123 Main St', city: 'New City' } }

// To seal the address as well:
Object.seal(company.address);

// Now, you can't change the address structure. This would fail/error:
// company.address.zip = "12345"; // Fails (silently or throws TypeError)

console.log(company); // Output: { name: 'Acme Corp', address: { street: '123 Main St', city: 'New City' } }
```

**Example 4: Checking if an object is sealed**

You can use `Object.isSealed()` to determine if an object is sealed.

```plaintext
const myObject = { a: 1, b: 2 };
console.log(Object.isSealed(myObject)); // Output: false

Object.seal(myObject);
console.log(Object.isSealed(myObject)); // Output: true
```

## `Object.seal()` vs. `Object.freeze()` vs. `Object.preventExtensions()`

It's crucial to understand the differences between `Object.seal()`, `Object.freeze()`, and `Object.preventExtensions()`:

| Feature             | `Object.preventExtensions()` | `Object.seal()`                    | `Object.freeze()`                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Adding Properties   | Not Allowed                  | Not Allowed                        | Not Allowed                                     |
| Deleting Properties | Allowed                      | Not Allowed                        | Not Allowed                                     |
| Modifying Values    | Allowed                      | Allowed (if property is writable)  | Not Allowed (properties become read-only)       |
| Configurability     | Remains Unchanged            | Properties become Non-Configurable | Properties become Non-Configurable              |
| Extensibility       | Becomes Non-Extensible       | Object becomes Sealed              | Object becomes Frozen                           |
| Mutability          | Least Restrictive            | More Restrictive                   | Most Restrictive                                |
| Nested Objects      | Shallow impact               | Shallow impact                     | Shallow impact (deep freeze requires recursion) |

**Key Differences Summarized:**

- **`Object.preventExtensions()`:** Only prevents adding new properties. Existing properties can still be deleted and their values can be changed.
- **`Object.seal()`:** Prevents adding _and_ deleting properties, and marks all existing properties as non-configurable. Existing writable properties _can_ still be modified.
- **`Object.freeze()`:** Prevents adding, deleting, _and_ modifying properties. It makes the object effectively immutable.

## When to Use `Object.seal()`

`Object.seal()` is useful in scenarios where you want to:

- **Enforce a specific object structure:** Ensure that the object always has a defined set of properties.
- **Prevent accidental property deletion:** Protect against bugs caused by accidentally deleting important properties.
- **Improve security:** Limit the potential for malicious code to tamper with the object's structure. While not a complete security solution, it adds a layer of protection.
- **Optimize performance:** In some JavaScript engines, sealing an object can enable optimizations, as the engine knows the object's structure won't change.

## Best Practices:

- **Understand the Limitations:** Remember that `Object.seal()` only provides a shallow level of sealing. Nested objects are not affected unless you explicitly seal them as well. Consider using recursive functions to deeply seal objects if necessary.
- **Use in Conjunction with `Object.freeze()`:** For truly immutable objects, combine `Object.seal()` and `Object.freeze()`. You could seal the structure first, then freeze to prevent modification.
- **Careful with Writable Properties:** Be mindful that writable properties can still be changed after sealing. If you want to prevent any modifications, consider using `Object.freeze()` or defining the properties as non-writable _before_ sealing.
- **Consider Performance Implications:** While sealing can sometimes improve performance, it's not always the case. Test your code to ensure that sealing doesn't introduce performance regressions.
- **Use Strict Mode:** Strict mode will cause errors to be thrown when attempting to modify sealed properties, making it easier to detect and debug issues.

## Conclusion

`Object.seal()` is a valuable tool in the JavaScript developer's arsenal. By understanding its functionality and limitations, you can use it to create more secure, predictable, and maintainable code. When choosing between `Object.seal()`, `Object.freeze()`, and `Object.preventExtensions()`, carefully consider the specific requirements of your application and the level of immutability you need to achieve. Remember to always test your code thoroughly to ensure that sealing objects doesn't introduce unexpected behavior or performance issues.
