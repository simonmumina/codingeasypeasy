# Next.js API Proxying Made Easy: A Comprehensive Guide to `next-http-proxy-middleware`

In modern web development, proxying external APIs is a common practice. It allows you to bypass CORS restrictions, mask API keys, simplify your frontend code, and improve security. When working with Next.js, `next-http-proxy-middleware` provides a straightforward and powerful way to implement API proxying within your application's API routes. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from basic setup to advanced configurations and security considerations.

## Why Use `next-http-proxy-middleware`?

`next-http-proxy-middleware` offers several key advantages for Next.js developers:

- **CORS Bypass:** Easily circumvent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when interacting with APIs hosted on different domains. This is particularly useful when the API you're consuming doesn't have permissive CORS headers.
- **API Key Masking:** Protect your sensitive API keys by keeping them on the server-side. Your frontend never directly interacts with the external API, ensuring that API keys remain hidden from the client.
- **Simplified Frontend Code:** Clean up your frontend code by abstracting away the complexities of direct API calls. Your frontend only needs to interact with your own API endpoints, which then proxy requests to the external API.
- **Improved Security:** By controlling which external APIs your frontend can access through the proxy, you can enforce security policies and prevent unauthorized requests.
- **Flexibility and Customization:** The library offers a wide range of configuration options, allowing you to customize the proxy behavior to meet your specific needs. You can modify headers, rewrite URLs, and implement advanced request handling.
- **Seamless Integration with Next.js:** `next-http-proxy-middleware` is designed to integrate seamlessly with Next.js API routes, making it easy to set up and use.

## Getting Started: Installation and Basic Configuration

### Installation

First, install the `next-http-proxy-middleware` package using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install next-http-proxy-middleware
# or
yarn add next-http-proxy-middleware
```

### Basic Configuration

Create a new API route in your `pages/api` directory (or `app/api` for the app router). For example, let's create a file named `pages/api/proxy.js` (or `app/api/proxy/route.js` for app router). This route will act as our proxy endpoint.

**Example for `pages/api/proxy.js`:**

```javascript
import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'next-http-proxy-middleware'

export default function handler(req, res) {
  return createProxyMiddleware({
    target: 'https://api.example.com', // The URL of the external API you want to proxy
    pathRewrite: {
      '^/api/proxy': '', // Remove the /api/proxy prefix when forwarding the request
    },
    changeOrigin: true, // For vhosts, change the origin of the request to the target URL
  })(req, res)
}

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false, // Disable body parsing for the API route
    externalResolver: true, // Mark as resolved by the user (allows proxy to take over)
  },
}
```

**Example for `app/api/proxy/route.js` (App Router):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'next-http-proxy-middleware'

export async function GET(req) {
  return await handleProxy(req)
}

export async function POST(req) {
  return await handleProxy(req)
}

// Add other methods as needed: PUT, DELETE, PATCH etc.

async function handleProxy(req) {
  const url = req.url

  // Extract the path after /api/proxy/
  const targetPath = url.replace(/^.*\/api\/proxy\//, '/')

  const proxy = createProxyMiddleware({
    target: 'https://api.example.com',
    pathRewrite: {
      '^/api/proxy': '',
      '^/api/proxy/': '', //remove for app router
    },
    changeOrigin: true,
    async onProxyReq(proxyReq, req, res) {
      // You might need to forward headers from the original request
      for (const [key, value] of req.headers.entries()) {
        proxyReq.setHeader(key, value)
      }
    },
    async onProxyRes(proxyRes, req, res) {
      // You might need to forward headers from the proxied response
      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(proxyRes.headers)) {
        res.setHeader(key, value)
      }
    },
  })

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    proxy(
      req,
      {
        ...NextResponse.prototype,
        setHeader: (name, value) => {
          headers[name] = value
          res.headers.set(name, value) // Important for app router, also set on NextResponse
        },
        end: (content) => {
          resolve(new NextResponse(content, { status: res.statusCode, headers })) // Return NextResponse object
        },
        statusCode: 200,
        statusMessage: 'OK',
      },
      (result) => {
        if (result instanceof Error) {
          reject(result)
        }
      }
    )

    const headers = {}
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Proxy Error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Proxy error' }, { status: 500 })
  })
}

// This is crucial for the App Router to properly handle streaming.
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
```

**Explanation:**

- **`createProxyMiddleware`:** This function creates the proxy middleware instance.
- **`target`:** Specifies the URL of the external API you want to proxy. Replace `https://api.example.com` with the actual API endpoint.
- **`pathRewrite`:** This option rewrites the request path before forwarding it to the target API. In this example, it removes the `/api/proxy` prefix from the request path. For the app router, we also add `'^/api/proxy/': ''` to remove any additional prefix.
- **`changeOrigin`:** Setting this to `true` changes the origin of the request to match the target URL. This is often necessary for virtual hosts to function correctly.
- **`config` (pages router):** The `config` object is specific to Next.js API routes. `bodyParser: false` disables the built-in body parsing, as the proxy middleware will handle the request body. `externalResolver: true` tells Next.js that the request is handled externally by the proxy middleware.
- **`headers` (app router):** We need to manually forward and set the headers when using the app router as the `NextResponse` object needs to be manipulated directly to set headers correctly and return the response object from the middleware. Also needed to ensure we set the status code correctly.
- **`dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` (app router):** This is crucial for the App Router to properly handle streaming. Without this, the endpoint might be cached and not function correctly as a proxy.
- **Async Helper Function (app router):** An async function `handleProxy` encapsulates the proxy logic. This is necessary to use `await` and ensure the promise returned by `createProxyMiddleware` is resolved before the NextResponse object is returned.
- **Error Handling (app router):** A `.catch` block handles any errors that occur during the proxy request. This prevents unhandled promise rejections and provides a user-friendly error message.

### Making Requests

Now, you can make requests to your Next.js API route (`/api/proxy`) as if it were the external API. For example, if you want to access `https://api.example.com/users`, you would make a request to `/api/proxy/users`.

```javascript
// Example Fetch request from your frontend

fetch('/api/proxy/users')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error)
  })
```

## Advanced Configuration Options

`next-http-proxy-middleware` offers a rich set of configuration options for customizing the proxy behavior. Here are some of the most useful options:

- **`router`:** Allows you to dynamically route requests to different target URLs based on the request.

  ```javascript
  // Example using the 'router' option
  import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'next-http-proxy-middleware'

  export default function handler(req, res) {
    return createProxyMiddleware({
      router: (req) => {
        if (req.url.startsWith('/api/proxy/users')) {
          return 'https://api.example.com'
        } else if (req.url.startsWith('/api/proxy/products')) {
          return 'https://api.another-example.com'
        } else {
          return 'https://api.default-example.com'
        }
      },
      pathRewrite: {
        '^/api/proxy': '',
        '^/api/proxy/': '', // remove for app router
      },
      changeOrigin: true,
    })(req, res)
  }

  export const config = {
    api: {
      bodyParser: false,
      externalResolver: true,
    },
  }
  ```

- **`headers`:** Allows you to add, modify, or remove headers in the outgoing request. This is useful for adding authentication tokens, modifying content types, or forwarding specific headers.

  ```javascript
  // Example using the 'headers' option
  import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'next-http-proxy-middleware'

  export default function handler(req, res) {
    return createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'https://api.example.com',
      pathRewrite: {
        '^/api/proxy': '',
      },
      changeOrigin: true,
      headers: {
        'X-Custom-Header': 'My Custom Value',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}`, // Access API Key from env var.
      },
    })(req, res)
  }

  export const config = {
    api: {
      bodyParser: false,
      externalResolver: true,
    },
  }
  ```

- **`onProxyReq`:** A function that allows you to modify the outgoing proxy request before it's sent. This is useful for adding custom logic, such as signing requests or modifying the request body.

  ```javascript
  // Example using the 'onProxyReq' option
  import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'next-http-proxy-middleware'

  export default function handler(req, res) {
    return createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'https://api.example.com',
      pathRewrite: {
        '^/api/proxy': '',
      },
      changeOrigin: true,
      onProxyReq: (proxyReq, req, res) => {
        // Add a custom header
        proxyReq.setHeader('X-My-Custom-Header', 'My Custom Value')

        // Modify the request body
        if (req.method === 'POST') {
          const body = JSON.stringify({
            ...req.body,
            addedProperty: 'This was added by the proxy',
          })
          proxyReq.setHeader('Content-Length', Buffer.byteLength(body))
          proxyReq.write(body)
        }
      },
    })(req, res)
  }

  export const config = {
    api: {
      bodyParser: false,
      externalResolver: true,
    },
  }
  ```

- **`onProxyRes`:** A function that allows you to modify the incoming proxy response before it's sent to the client. This is useful for modifying the response body, adding custom headers, or handling errors.

  ```javascript
  // Example using the 'onProxyRes' option
  import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'next-http-proxy-middleware'

  export default function handler(req, res) {
    return createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'https://api.example.com',
      pathRewrite: {
        '^/api/proxy': '',
      },
      changeOrigin: true,
      onProxyRes: (proxyRes, req, res) => {
        // Add a custom header
        proxyRes.headers['X-My-Custom-Header'] = 'My Custom Value'

        // Modify the response body
        let body = ''
        proxyRes.on('data', (chunk) => {
          body += chunk
        })
        proxyRes.on('end', () => {
          try {
            const json = JSON.parse(body)
            json.addedByProxy = 'This was added by the proxy'
            const newBody = JSON.stringify(json)

            res.setHeader('Content-Length', Buffer.byteLength(newBody))
            res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
            res.end(newBody)
          } catch (e) {
            console.error('Failed to parse or modify response body:', e)
            res.end(body) // Send original body on error.
          }
        })
      },
    })(req, res)
  }

  export const config = {
    api: {
      bodyParser: false,
      externalResolver: true,
    },
  }
  ```

- **`onError`:** A function that allows you to handle errors that occur during the proxy process. This is useful for logging errors, sending custom error responses, or retrying requests.

  ```javascript
  // Example using the 'onError' option
  import { createProxyMiddleware } from 'next-http-proxy-middleware'

  export default function handler(req, res) {
    return createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'https://api.example.com',
      pathRewrite: {
        '^/api/proxy': '',
      },
      changeOrigin: true,
      onError: (err, req, res) => {
        console.error('Proxy error:', err)
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Proxy error occurred.' })
      },
    })(req, res)
  }

  export const config = {
    api: {
      bodyParser: false,
      externalResolver: true,
    },
  }
  ```

## Security Considerations

When using `next-http-proxy-middleware`, it's crucial to implement proper security measures to protect your application and data:

- **Input Validation:** Always validate the input data you receive from the client before forwarding it to the external API. This helps prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect your API endpoints from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access your API endpoints. Use API keys stored as environment variables and implement secure authentication methods.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between your Next.js application and the external API. This helps protect sensitive data from eavesdropping.
- **CORS Configuration:** While the proxy helps bypass CORS on the client-side, carefully configure the CORS settings of your own API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access from other domains.

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for `next-http-proxy-middleware`:

- **Integrating with Third-Party APIs:** Proxying requests to external APIs to bypass CORS restrictions and mask API keys.
- **Migrating APIs:** Gradually migrating an existing API to a new infrastructure by proxying requests to the new API while maintaining the old API's endpoint.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple backend servers by using the proxy as a load balancer. (Advanced configuration needed).
- **Development and Testing:** Simulating a production environment during development and testing by proxying requests to a local development server.

## Best Practices

- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information, such as API keys and target URLs, in environment variables. This helps protect your credentials and makes it easier to manage your application in different environments.
- **Log Errors:** Implement proper error logging to track and diagnose issues with your proxy configuration.
- **Monitor Performance:** Monitor the performance of your proxy endpoints to identify bottlenecks and optimize your configuration.
- **Keep Up-to-Date:** Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of `next-http-proxy-middleware` and Next.js to benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and new features.
- **Document Your Configuration:** Clearly document your proxy configuration to make it easier for other developers to understand and maintain.

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Errors Still Occurring:** Double-check that the `changeOrigin` option is set to `true`. If the target API has specific CORS requirements, you might need to adjust the headers in the `onProxyReq` or `onProxyRes` options.
- **Requests Not Being Proxied:** Ensure that your API route path is correctly configured and that the `pathRewrite` option is removing the correct prefix. Verify that the `externalResolver` option is set to `true` in the `config` object (pages router).
- **500 Errors:** Check your server logs for error messages. Use the `onError` option to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error responses to the client. For app router, remember to return `NextResponse` objects for errors.
- **App Router Issues:** Double-check header forwarding logic in `onProxyReq` and `onProxyRes`. Ensure proper handling with `NextResponse` for successful and error scenarios. Ensure `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is included.

## Conclusion

`next-http-proxy-middleware` is a valuable tool for Next.js developers who need to proxy external APIs. By understanding the configuration options, security considerations, and best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively use this library to build secure, efficient, and maintainable web applications. Remember to always prioritize security and follow best practices to ensure the integrity of your application and data. Happy proxying!
