# HTML DOM Input Week Object: Mastering Week Selection with JavaScript

The `<input type="week">` element in HTML provides a convenient way for users to select a week and year.  The HTML DOM Input Week object allows you to manipulate and interact with these week input elements using JavaScript. This article provides a deep dive into the `HTML DOM Input Week` object, covering its properties, methods, and practical applications with clear and concise code examples.

## What is the `<input type="week">` Element?

The `<input type="week">` element is an HTML5 input type that allows users to select a specific week of a year. The value is returned in the format `YYYY-Www`, where `YYYY` is the year and `ww` is the week number (01 to 53). It provides a built-in week picker interface in most modern browsers, simplifying the process of week selection for users.

## The HTML DOM Input Week Object

The `HTML DOM Input Week` object represents the `<input type="week">` element in the Document Object Model (DOM). It inherits properties and methods from the generic `HTMLInputElement` interface, and also has some specific properties relevant to week selection.

## Properties of the Input Week Object

Here's a breakdown of the key properties you can access and manipulate through the `HTML DOM Input Week` object:

*   **`value`**:  Gets or sets the current value of the week input field. This is the most crucial property for getting and setting the selected week.  It is a string in the format `YYYY-Www`.

*   **`defaultValue`**: Gets or sets the default value of the week input field.  This is the initial value set in the HTML.

*   **`min`**: Gets or sets the minimum allowed week value.  This allows you to restrict the range of selectable weeks.

*   **`max`**: Gets or sets the maximum allowed week value.  This allows you to restrict the range of selectable weeks.

*   **`step`**: Gets or sets the granularity that the value must adhere to. This defines intervals for the value attribute.  For week, a step value of 1 means week intervals.

*   **`stepUp(number)`**: Increments the value of the input by the value given by the `step` attribute or by the default step size if `step` is not set (which is 1 week). The optional `number` parameter specifies how many steps to increment by.

*   **`stepDown(number)`**: Decrements the value of the input by the value given by the `step` attribute or by the default step size if `step` is not set (which is 1 week). The optional `number` parameter specifies how many steps to decrement by.

*   **`valueAsNumber`**:  Returns the week value as a number. This is typically less useful for week inputs compared to date inputs. Returns NaN if the value cannot be converted to a number.

*   **`valueAsDate`**: Returns the week as a Date object representing the first day of the selected week. This requires browser support and might not be widely implemented. Returns `null` if the value cannot be converted to a Date. *Be aware of potential cross-browser compatibility issues with this property.*

*   **Inherited Properties:**  The Input Week object also inherits properties from the `HTMLInputElement` interface and `HTMLElement` interface, such as `id`, `name`, `type`, `disabled`, `readOnly`, `required`, `form`, `classList`, `style` and many others. These properties allow you to interact with the element in a more general sense.

## Basic Usage: Getting and Setting the Week Value

The most common operation is getting and setting the selected week.  Here's how you can do it using JavaScript:

```html
<input type="week" id="weekPicker" name="weekPicker">

<script>
  const weekPicker = document.getElementById('weekPicker');

  // Get the current week value
  const currentWeek = weekPicker.value;
  console.log("Current Week:", currentWeek);

  // Set a week value
  weekPicker.value = "2024-W05"; // Set to the 5th week of 2024
  console.log("Week set to:", weekPicker.value);
</script>
```

This code snippet first gets a reference to the input element using `document.getElementById()`. Then, it retrieves the current value using the `value` property and sets a new week value also using the `value` property.  The `value` will be a string in `YYYY-Www` format.

## Setting Minimum and Maximum Weeks

Restricting the selectable week range can be important for ensuring that users only select valid weeks.

```html
<input type="week" id="weekPicker" name="weekPicker" min="2023-W52" max="2024-W10">

<script>
  const weekPicker = document.getElementById('weekPicker');

  // Get the min and max values
  const minWeek = weekPicker.min;
  const maxWeek = weekPicker.max;

  console.log("Minimum Week:", minWeek); // Output: 2023-W52
  console.log("Maximum Week:", maxWeek); // Output: 2024-W10

  // Attempt to set a value outside the range (browser behavior will vary)
  weekPicker.value = "2024-W50"; // Outside the valid range. Browser may not allow this and revert to min/max.
</script>
```

This example sets the `min` and `max` attributes of the input element.  The browser will typically prevent the user from selecting weeks outside of this range.  The behavior when setting the `value` programmatically to a value outside the range can vary depending on the browser; it may be clipped to the `min` or `max` value, or simply ignored.

## Using `stepUp()` and `stepDown()`

The `stepUp()` and `stepDown()` methods allow you to programmatically increment or decrement the selected week.

```html
<input type="week" id="weekPicker" name="weekPicker" value="2024-W01">
<button onclick="stepUpWeek()">Next Week</button>
<button onclick="stepDownWeek()">Previous Week</button>

<script>
  const weekPicker = document.getElementById('weekPicker');

  function stepUpWeek() {
    weekPicker.stepUp(); // Increments by one week (default)
    console.log("Week stepped up to:", weekPicker.value);
  }

  function stepDownWeek() {
    weekPicker.stepDown(); // Decrements by one week (default)
    console.log("Week stepped down to:", weekPicker.value);
  }
</script>
```

This code provides buttons that increment or decrement the selected week by one week each time they are clicked.

## Validation

You can validate the week input using HTML5 validation attributes such as `required`, `min`, and `max`. You can also check for validity using JavaScript:

```html
<form id="myForm">
  <label for="weekPicker">Select a Week (required):</label>
  <input type="week" id="weekPicker" name="weekPicker" required min="2023-W40" max="2024-W20">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
  const form = document.getElementById('myForm');
  const weekPicker = document.getElementById('weekPicker');

  form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    if (!weekPicker.checkValidity()) {
      alert("Please select a valid week within the specified range.");
      event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
    } else {
      alert("Form submitted with week: " + weekPicker.value);
    }
  });
</script>
```

This example shows how to use the `required`, `min`, and `max` attributes to validate the week input.  The `checkValidity()` method returns `true` if the input is valid and `false` otherwise.  The event listener prevents form submission if the input is invalid.

## Cross-Browser Considerations

While `<input type="week">` is supported by most modern browsers, older browsers may not render it correctly or provide a native week picker. In such cases, you might need to use a JavaScript polyfill or a third-party date/week picker library.  Also, be particularly aware of the limited browser support for the `valueAsDate` property.

## Practical Applications

*   **Scheduling Applications:** Allowing users to select specific weeks for appointments or events.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:** Filtering data by week ranges.
*   **Project Management:** Setting deadlines and milestones on a weekly basis.
*   **Data Entry Forms:** Collecting data for specific weeks in a year.

## Conclusion

The `HTML DOM Input Week` object provides a powerful way to interact with week input elements using JavaScript. By understanding its properties and methods, you can effectively manage week selections, validate user input, and enhance the user experience in your web applications.  Remember to test your code across different browsers and consider using polyfills or libraries to ensure compatibility with older browsers. This knowledge empowers you to create more robust and user-friendly web forms that require week-specific data.
