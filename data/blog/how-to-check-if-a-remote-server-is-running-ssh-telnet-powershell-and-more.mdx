# How to Check if a Remote Server is Running SSH: Telnet, PowerShell, and More

Secure Shell (SSH) is a crucial protocol for securely connecting to and managing remote servers.  Before attempting to connect to a server via SSH, it's often necessary to verify that the SSH service is actually running and listening on the default port (22) or a custom port.  This blog post will guide you through various methods to check if a remote server is running SSH, focusing on using Telnet and PowerShell on Windows, but also mentioning options for Linux environments. This is a fundamental skill for network administrators, developers, and anyone managing remote servers.

## Why Check if SSH is Running?

* **Troubleshooting Connection Issues:**  If you can't connect to a server via SSH, the first step is to confirm that the SSH service is active.  Failure to do so can lead you down unnecessary rabbit holes.
* **Security Audits:**  Ensuring that SSH is running only on authorized servers is an important security practice.  Identifying unexpected SSH services could indicate unauthorized access or configuration errors.
* **Pre-Deployment Verification:** Before deploying an application that relies on SSH connections, verify that the SSH service is configured correctly on the target server.
* **Port Configuration:** Confirming the SSH port is open is vital. Sometimes it may be configured on a port other than the default port 22.

## Method 1: Using Telnet (Windows)

Telnet is a simple command-line tool that can be used to test connectivity to a specific port on a remote server.  While Telnet transmits data in plaintext and is generally considered insecure for transmitting sensitive information, it's still a useful tool for basic port connectivity testing.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Telnet Client (if necessary):**  By default, the Telnet client is not enabled in Windows. You'll need to enable it through the Control Panel.
   * Go to **Control Panel** -> **Programs** -> **Programs and Features** -> **Turn Windows features on or off**.
   * Check the box next to "Telnet Client" and click **OK**.

2. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:** Search for "cmd" or "powershell" and run it.

3. **Use the `telnet` command:**

   ```bash
   telnet <server_address> 22
   ```

   Replace `<server_address>` with the IP address or hostname of the remote server you want to check. For example:

   ```bash
   telnet example.com 22
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   telnet 192.168.1.100 22
   ```

4. **Interpret the Results:**

   * **Success:** If the SSH service is running and listening on port 22, you will see a blank screen or a connection attempt that then closes. This indicates that Telnet was able to establish a connection.  **Important:** A blank screen *can* mean the port is open, but sometimes it can mean a firewall is silently dropping the connection. A closed connection is a clearer success indicator.
   * **Failure (Connection Refused):**  If you receive an error message like "Could not open connection to the host, on port 22: Connection failed" or "Connection refused," it indicates that the SSH service is not running on the specified port, is blocked by a firewall, or the server is unreachable.

**Example:**

```bash
C:\> telnet example.com 22
Connecting to example.com...Could not open connection to the host, on port 22: Connection failed
```

This indicates that SSH is *not* running on example.com on port 22, or a firewall is blocking the connection.

**Checking a Different Port:**

If the SSH service is configured to run on a non-standard port (e.g., 2222), specify that port number:

```bash
telnet example.com 2222
```

## Method 2: Using PowerShell's `Test-NetConnection` (Windows)

PowerShell's `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet provides a more robust and informative way to test network connectivity, including checking if a specific port is open.

**Steps:**

1. **Open PowerShell:** Search for "PowerShell" and run it.

2. **Use the `Test-NetConnection` cmdlet:**

   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <server_address> -Port 22
   ```

   Replace `<server_address>` with the IP address or hostname of the remote server. For example:

   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName example.com -Port 22
   ```

   or

   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName 192.168.1.100 -Port 22
   ```

3. **Interpret the Results:**

   The output of `Test-NetConnection` provides detailed information about the connection attempt.  The key indicator is the `TcpTestSucceeded` property.

   * **`TcpTestSucceeded : True`:**  This indicates that a TCP connection was successfully established on the specified port, meaning the SSH service is likely running and listening on that port.
   * **`TcpTestSucceeded : False`:**  This indicates that a TCP connection could not be established.  This could mean the SSH service is not running, is blocked by a firewall, or the server is unreachable. You'll need to investigate further.

**Example:**

```powershell
PS C:\> Test-NetConnection -ComputerName example.com -Port 22

ComputerName           : example.com
RemoteAddress          : 93.184.216.34
RemotePort             : 22
InterfaceAlias         : Ethernet
SourceAddress          : 192.168.1.105
TcpTestSucceeded       : False
```

In this example, `TcpTestSucceeded` is `False`, indicating that SSH is *not* running on example.com on port 22, or a firewall is blocking the connection.

**Checking a Different Port:**

To check a non-standard port, simply change the `-Port` parameter:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName example.com -Port 2222
```

**More Detailed Output:**

You can get even more information by adding `-InformationLevel Detailed`:

```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName example.com -Port 22 -InformationLevel Detailed
```

This will provide information about the network route taken to reach the server, which can be helpful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues.

## Method 3: Using `nmap` (Cross-Platform - Requires Installation)

`nmap` (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source utility for network exploration and security auditing.  It's available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. While it requires installation, it provides a highly reliable and detailed port scanning capabilities.

**Steps (General):**

1. **Install `nmap`:** Download and install `nmap` from [https://nmap.org/](https://nmap.org/).  Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.  On Windows, this usually involves running the installer and accepting the default options.

2. **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal:**

3. **Use the `nmap` command:**

   ```bash
   nmap -p 22 <server_address>
   ```

   Replace `<server_address>` with the IP address or hostname of the remote server. For example:

   ```bash
   nmap -p 22 example.com
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   nmap -p 22 192.168.1.100
   ```

4. **Interpret the Results:**

   `nmap` will scan port 22 on the specified server.  The output will show the status of the port.

   * **`22/tcp  open  ssh`:** This indicates that port 22 is open and `nmap` has identified it as likely running the SSH service.  This is the most reliable indication that SSH is running.
   * **`22/tcp  filtered  ssh`:** This often means a firewall is blocking the connection, preventing `nmap` from definitively determining if the port is open or closed.
   * **`22/tcp  closed  ssh`:** This indicates that port 22 is closed, meaning the SSH service is not running or is not configured to listen on that port.

**Example:**

```bash
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-10-27 14:30 EDT
Nmap scan report for example.com (93.184.216.34)
Host is up (0.018s latency).

PORT   STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp closed ssh

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.17 seconds
```

This indicates that SSH is *not* running on example.com on port 22.

**Checking a Different Port:**

```bash
nmap -p 2222 example.com
```

## Method 4: Using `ssh` (Linux/macOS)

If you have the `ssh` client available (typically on Linux and macOS systems, and sometimes installed on Windows via tools like Git for Windows or Cygwin), you can use a connection test to check if the service is available.  This method doesn't directly check if the *SSH service* is running, but it attempts to establish a connection, and any failure will indicate a problem (which could be the service not running, a firewall, or incorrect credentials).

```bash
ssh -v -T <user>@<server_address> -p 22
```

Replace `<user>` with a valid username on the server (you don't need to know the password), and `<server_address>` with the IP address or hostname. The `-v` flag enables verbose output for debugging, and the `-T` flag disables pseudo-terminal allocation (we're just checking connectivity, not running commands). The `-p 22` specifies the port.  You can omit `-p 22` if the SSH server is on the default port.

**Interpreting the Output:**

* **Success (Connection Established):** If the command returns a message indicating a successful connection (e.g., "Connection established," or a banner is displayed), SSH is running and reachable.  The connection will likely be closed immediately because we haven't provided a password.

* **Failure (Connection Refused, Timeout, etc.):**  If you receive an error message such as "Connection refused," "Connection timed out," or "Host is unreachable," it indicates that the SSH service is not running, is blocked by a firewall, or the server is unreachable.

**Example:**

```bash
ssh -v -T user@example.com -p 22

```
In this case, the "Connection established" message and the subsequent authentication attempts indicate a successful connection to the SSH server. You'd then enter the password or use SSH keys for full authentication.

A failure would result in a much shorter error message, indicating the connection problem.

## Method 5: For Linux/macOS use `nc` command

The `nc` (netcat) command is a versatile network utility available on most Linux and macOS systems. It can be used to establish basic TCP connections.

```bash
nc -zv <server_address> 22
```

Replace `<server_address>` with the server's IP or hostname. The `-z` flag tells `nc` to just scan for listening daemons without sending any data, and the `-v` flag enables verbose output.

**Interpreting the Output:**

* **`Connection to <server_address> port 22 [tcp/*] succeeded!`**: This indicates a successful connection, implying the SSH service is running.

* **`nc: connect to <server_address> port 22 (tcp) failed: Connection refused`**: This signifies the SSH service isn't running, is blocked by a firewall, or the server is unreachable.

**Example:**

```bash
nc -zv example.com 22
nc: connect to example.com port 22 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
```

This indicates that SSH is not running on example.com on port 22, or a firewall is blocking the connection.

## Important Considerations:

* **Firewalls:**  Firewalls on the remote server or in the network path can block connections to port 22 (or your custom port), even if the SSH service is running.  Make sure to check firewall rules if you are consistently getting connection failures.
* **Network Connectivity:**  Verify that you can reach the remote server in general (e.g., using `ping`). If you can't ping the server, you have a network connectivity problem that needs to be resolved before you can check the SSH service.
* **Server Configuration:**  Ensure that the SSH service is configured to listen on the correct port and interface.  Check the SSH server configuration file (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on Linux systems).
* **Security:**  Be mindful of security implications when using tools like Telnet, which transmit data in plaintext.  Prefer `Test-NetConnection` or `nmap` for more secure testing.  If testing from a local machine on your network, telnet can be safe as all communication will be internal.

## Conclusion

Checking if a remote server is running SSH is a fundamental step in network troubleshooting, security auditing, and server management.  By using the methods outlined in this guide – Telnet, PowerShell's `Test-NetConnection`, `nmap`, `ssh -v -T`, and `nc` – you can quickly and effectively verify the status of the SSH service and troubleshoot any connection issues. Remember to consider firewall rules and network connectivity when interpreting the results. Choose the method that best suits your environment and technical expertise.  Good luck!
