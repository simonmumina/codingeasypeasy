# Best Ways to Show AdMob Ads in Ionic Apps: Monetization Strategies and Implementation Guide

Monetizing your Ionic application is a crucial step in ensuring its continued development and support. AdMob, Google's mobile advertising platform, provides a relatively easy way to integrate ads into your app and generate revenue. This guide will walk you through the best practices for integrating AdMob into your Ionic application, covering various ad formats and providing code examples to get you started.

## Introduction to AdMob and Ionic

AdMob allows you to display different types of ads within your Ionic application. These ads can be banners, interstitial ads, rewarded video ads, and native advanced ads. Choosing the right ad format and strategy is essential for maximizing revenue without disrupting the user experience. Ionic, being a framework for building cross-platform hybrid mobile apps, relies on Cordova plugins to interact with native device features, including ad networks.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, make sure you have the following:

- **AdMob Account:** You'll need a Google AdMob account. Create one at [https://admob.google.com](https://admob.google.com).
- **AdMob App ID:** Register your Ionic application in AdMob to get a unique App ID.
- **Ad Unit IDs:** Create ad units within your AdMob account for each ad format you intend to use (banner, interstitial, rewarded). These IDs will be used in your Ionic app to request ads.
- **Ionic Project:** You should have an existing Ionic project or be prepared to create a new one.
- **Cordova CLI & Ionic CLI:** Ensure you have the Cordova and Ionic command-line interfaces installed globally.

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g cordova ionic
  ```

- **Cordova Plugin:** We will use a Cordova plugin to interact with AdMob's native SDKs. We'll use a community plugin for this tutorial.

## Choosing the Right Ad Format

Selecting the appropriate ad format is crucial for balancing monetization with user experience. Here's a breakdown of common ad formats and their typical use cases:

- **Banner Ads:** Small, rectangular ads that appear at the top or bottom of the screen. They are relatively unobtrusive but generally have lower revenue potential. Best suited for apps where screen real estate is limited or constant visibility is desired.
- **Interstitial Ads:** Full-screen ads that appear at natural transition points in your app, such as after completing a level, during loading screens, or when navigating between sections. They are more intrusive but offer higher earning potential. Important to use sparingly to avoid frustrating users.
- **Rewarded Video Ads:** Ads that users can choose to watch in exchange for in-app rewards, such as virtual currency, extra lives, or unlocking content. They are highly engaging and user-friendly, as users opt-in to view them. Excellent for providing value to users while generating revenue.
- **Native Advanced Ads:** Ads that are designed to seamlessly blend with the look and feel of your app's content. They offer a more integrated and less disruptive experience, but require more effort to implement correctly. Useful for integrating ads directly within your app's feed or content stream.

## Installing the AdMob Cordova Plugin

First, you need to install the Cordova plugin that bridges the gap between your Ionic/Angular code and the native AdMob SDKs. We'll use a well-maintained community plugin. Remember to always research and choose plugins that are actively maintained and have positive community feedback.

```plaintext
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-admob-free
npm install @ionic-native/admob-free
```

This command installs the plugin and its corresponding Ionic Native wrapper, making it easier to use in your Angular code.

**Important:** After installing the plugin, rebuild your Ionic app for the changes to take effect.

## Implementing Banner Ads

Banner ads are the most basic ad format. Here's how to implement them:

```plaintext
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular'
import { AdMobFree, AdMobFreeBannerConfig } from '@ionic-native/admob-free/ngx'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  constructor(
    private platform: Platform,
    private admobFree: AdMobFree
  ) {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      this.initAdMob()
    })
  }

  initAdMob() {
    if (!this.platform.is('cordova')) {
      console.warn('AdMob not available on non-cordova platform')
      return
    }

    const bannerConfig: AdMobFreeBannerConfig = {
      id: 'YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Ad Unit ID
      isTesting: true, // Remove in production
      autoShow: true,
      bannerAtTop: false, // Display banner at the bottom (default)
    }

    this.admobFree.banner.config(bannerConfig)

    this.admobFree.banner
      .prepare()
      .then(() => {
        // Banner Ad is prepared
        // Auto show is set to true, so the banner will be displayed upon preparation
        console.log('Banner ad prepared')
      })
      .catch((e) => console.log('Error preparing banner ad', e))
  }

  // Optional: Hide the banner ad
  hideBanner() {
    this.admobFree.banner
      .hide()
      .then(() => {
        console.log('Banner ad hidden')
      })
      .catch((e) => console.log('Error hiding banner ad', e))
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** Import `Platform`, `AdMobFree`, and `AdMobFreeBannerConfig` from their respective packages.
2.  **Initialize AdMob in `platform.ready()`:** This ensures that the Cordova plugins are ready before attempting to use them.
3.  **Configure the Banner Ad:** Create a `AdMobFreeBannerConfig` object and set the `id` to your banner ad unit ID. Set `isTesting` to `true` during development to avoid using real ads and potentially violating AdMob policies. `autoShow` determines whether the banner will be displayed immediately after being prepared. `bannerAtTop` determines whether it appears at the top or bottom of the screen.
4.  **Prepare the Banner Ad:** Call `this.admobFree.banner.prepare(bannerConfig)` to request and prepare the ad. The `then()` block is executed when the ad is successfully prepared. The `catch()` block handles any errors that occur during preparation.
5.  **Optional: Hide the Banner Ad:** The `hideBanner()` function allows you to programmatically hide the banner ad if needed.

**Important:** Replace `'YOUR_BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID'` with your actual AdMob banner ad unit ID. Remember to set `isTesting: false` when deploying to production.

## Implementing Interstitial Ads

Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that appear at natural transition points in your app.

```plaintext
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular'
import { AdMobFree, AdMobFreeInterstitialConfig } from '@ionic-native/admob-free/ngx'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  constructor(
    private platform: Platform,
    private admobFree: AdMobFree
  ) {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      this.initAdMob()
    })
  }

  initAdMob() {
    if (!this.platform.is('cordova')) {
      console.warn('AdMob not available on non-cordova platform')
      return
    }

    const interstitialConfig: AdMobFreeInterstitialConfig = {
      id: 'YOUR_INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Ad Unit ID
      isTesting: true, // Remove in production
      autoShow: false, // We'll show it manually
    }

    this.admobFree.interstitial.config(interstitialConfig)
  }

  // Function to show the Interstitial ad
  showInterstitial() {
    this.admobFree.interstitial
      .prepare()
      .then(() => {
        // Interstitial Ad is prepared
        this.admobFree.interstitial
          .show()
          .then(() => {
            console.log('Interstitial ad shown')
          })
          .catch((e) => console.log('Error showing interstitial ad', e))
      })
      .catch((e) => console.log('Error preparing interstitial ad', e))
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** Similar to banner ads, import the relevant modules.
2.  **Configure the Interstitial Ad:** Create an `AdMobFreeInterstitialConfig` object and set the `id` to your interstitial ad unit ID. Set `autoShow` to `false` because we'll show the ad manually at a specific point in our application.
3.  **Prepare and Show the Interstitial Ad:** The `showInterstitial()` function prepares and shows the ad. First, `prepare()` is called to load the ad. If successful, `show()` is called to display the ad.

**Important:** Replace `'YOUR_INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID'` with your actual AdMob interstitial ad unit ID. Call the `showInterstitial()` function at appropriate moments in your application, such as after a user completes a task or navigates to a new section. Avoid showing interstitial ads too frequently, as this can negatively impact the user experience.

## Implementing Rewarded Video Ads

Rewarded video ads offer users in-app rewards in exchange for watching a video.

```plaintext
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular'
import { AdMobFree, AdMobFreeRewardVideoConfig } from '@ionic-native/admob-free/ngx'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  constructor(
    private platform: Platform,
    private admobFree: AdMobFree
  ) {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      this.initAdMob()
      this.admobFree.on('admob.rewardvideo.reward').subscribe(() => {
        console.log('User rewarded!')
        //Give the user the reward here
        this.giveUserReward()
      })
    })
  }

  giveUserReward() {
    //Logic to give the user reward, example increment points

    //For example:
    //this.userPoints += 10;
    console.log('Giving user reward')
  }

  initAdMob() {
    if (!this.platform.is('cordova')) {
      console.warn('AdMob not available on non-cordova platform')
      return
    }

    const rewardVideoConfig: AdMobFreeRewardVideoConfig = {
      id: 'YOUR_REWARDED_VIDEO_AD_UNIT_ID', // Replace with your Ad Unit ID
      isTesting: true, // Remove in production
      autoShow: false, // We'll show it manually
    }

    this.admobFree.rewardVideo.config(rewardVideoConfig)
  }

  // Function to show the Rewarded Video ad
  showRewardedVideo() {
    this.admobFree.rewardVideo
      .prepare()
      .then(() => {
        // Rewarded Video Ad is prepared
        this.admobFree.rewardVideo
          .show()
          .then(() => {
            console.log('Rewarded video ad shown')
          })
          .catch((e) => console.log('Error showing rewarded video ad', e))
      })
      .catch((e) => console.log('Error preparing rewarded video ad', e))
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** Import the necessary modules as before.
2.  **Configure the Rewarded Video Ad:** Create an `AdMobFreeRewardVideoConfig` object and set the `id` to your rewarded video ad unit ID. Set `autoShow` to `false` because we'll control when the ad is shown.
3.  **Listen for Reward Events:** Subscribe to the `admob.rewardvideo.reward` event. This event is triggered when the user has successfully watched the video and is eligible for the reward. Inside the subscribe method, call your `giveUserReward()` function to provide the reward to the user.
4.  **Prepare and Show the Rewarded Video Ad:** The `showRewardedVideo()` function prepares and shows the ad.
5.  **`giveUserReward()` Function:** This is a placeholder function where you should implement the logic to give the user the reward within your application.

**Important:** Replace `'YOUR_REWARDED_VIDEO_AD_UNIT_ID'` with your actual AdMob rewarded video ad unit ID. Implement the `giveUserReward()` function to provide the user with the appropriate reward. Consider providing meaningful and valuable rewards to incentivize users to watch the videos.

## Implementing Native Advanced Ads (Advanced)

Native Advanced Ads are more complex to implement as they require you to handle the ad layout and presentation within your application. This provides better user experience as the ads are seamlessly integrated. Due to the complexity, a full code example isn't feasible here but here's the general approach:

1.  **Configure Ad Unit:** In AdMob, create a Native Advanced ad unit.
2.  **Fetch the Ad:** Use the plugin to request a native ad for your unit ID.
3.  **Render the Ad:** You will need to design a template within your Ionic application to display the ad's elements (headline, body, image, call to action button). The plugin will provide you with the data for these elements.
4.  **Handle Clicks and Impressions:** The plugin provides mechanisms to track clicks and impressions on the ad, which are essential for reporting and revenue generation.

Consult the plugin documentation and AdMob guidelines for detailed instructions on implementing Native Advanced Ads. This ad format requires more effort but offers the potential for a more integrated and less disruptive advertising experience.

## Best Practices for AdMob Implementation in Ionic Apps

- **Test Thoroughly:** Use test ad unit IDs during development to avoid generating invalid impressions and clicks, which can lead to account suspension.
- **Respect User Experience:** Avoid intrusive ad placements and excessive ad frequency. Strive to provide a balanced and enjoyable user experience.
- **Monitor Ad Performance:** Regularly monitor your AdMob dashboard to track ad performance metrics, such as impressions, click-through rates, and revenue. Use this data to optimize your ad placements and strategies.
- **Follow AdMob Policies:** Strictly adhere to AdMob's policies and guidelines to avoid account penalties.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle situations where ads fail to load or display. Provide informative messages to the user and consider alternative monetization strategies.
- **Use Mediation:** Consider using AdMob mediation to integrate multiple ad networks and maximize your revenue. Mediation allows you to serve ads from different sources and optimize based on performance.
- **Targeting and Segmentation:** Leverage AdMob's targeting options to display relevant ads to your users. This can improve ad engagement and revenue.
- **Frequency Capping:** Implement frequency capping to limit the number of times a user sees the same ad within a specific time period. This can help prevent ad fatigue and improve user experience.
- **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different ad placements, formats, and frequencies to determine what works best for your app and audience. Use A/B testing tools to compare different variations and optimize your monetization strategy.
- **GDPR and CCPA Compliance:** If your app serves users in Europe (GDPR) or California (CCPA), ensure you obtain proper consent before displaying personalized ads. Use a consent management platform (CMP) to handle user consent and comply with privacy regulations. Many plugins provide basic consent collection or can be integrated with existing CMP solutions.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Ads Not Showing:**
  - Double-check your ad unit IDs and ensure they are correctly configured.
  - Verify that you have internet connectivity.
  - Check your AdMob account for any policy violations or restrictions.
  - Ensure that you have correctly implemented the Cordova plugin and its dependencies.
- **Plugin Not Working:**
  - Make sure you have installed the plugin correctly using the Cordova CLI.
  - Check for any compatibility issues between the plugin and your Ionic version.
  - Consult the plugin's documentation and community forums for troubleshooting tips.
- **Testing Issues:**
  - Use test ad unit IDs during development to avoid generating invalid impressions.
  - Ensure that your device is configured as a test device in your AdMob account.
  - Check the console for any error messages related to the AdMob SDK.

## Conclusion

Integrating AdMob into your Ionic application is a powerful way to monetize your hard work. By understanding the different ad formats, implementing the Cordova plugin correctly, and following best practices, you can effectively generate revenue while maintaining a positive user experience. Remember to continually monitor your ad performance and adapt your strategies to maximize your earning potential. Good luck!
