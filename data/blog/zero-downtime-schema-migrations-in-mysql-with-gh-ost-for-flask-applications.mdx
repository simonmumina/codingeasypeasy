# Zero-Downtime Schema Migrations in MySQL with gh-ost for Flask Applications

Performing schema migrations on a production database can be a daunting task. Traditional `ALTER TABLE` operations often lock the table, rendering your application unavailable for the duration of the migration. This downtime can be costly and disruptive, especially for applications with high availability requirements. Fortunately, tools like GitHub's `gh-ost` (GitHub Online Schema Change) provide a solution, enabling zero-downtime schema migrations. This blog post will guide you through integrating `gh-ost` with your Flask application using MySQL.

## What is gh-ost?

`gh-ost` is a triggerless online schema migration tool for MySQL. It works by creating a shadow table with the desired schema, copying data from the original table to the shadow table, and then atomically switching the two tables. This process minimizes downtime and allows your application to continue operating during the migration.

**Key features of gh-ost:**

- **Zero-downtime:** Minimizes application downtime during schema changes.
- **Triggerless:** Avoids the performance overhead associated with triggers.
- **Gradual data copy:** Controls the impact of data copying on the database server.
- **Verification:** Validates data integrity during and after the migration.
- **Cut-over control:** Provides fine-grained control over the switchover process.
- **Pause and resume:** Allows you to pause and resume migrations as needed.
- **Throttling:** Dynamically adjusts the migration speed based on database load.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the integration, ensure you have the following:

- **MySQL Database:** A running MySQL instance.
- **Flask Application:** A Flask application connected to your MySQL database.
- **gh-ost Binary:** Download and install the `gh-ost` binary from the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/github/gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost). Make sure the binary is in your system's `$PATH`.
- **Python `subprocess` module:** This is a standard Python module, so you likely already have it. We'll use it to execute `gh-ost` commands from our Flask application.
- **Appropriate MySQL privileges:** The user used by gh-ost needs `SUPER`, `REPLICATION SLAVE`, `REPLICATION CLIENT`, `PROCESS`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `LOCK TABLES`, `CREATE VIEW`, `SHOW VIEW`, `TRIGGER`, `CREATE ROUTINE`, `ALTER ROUTINE`, and `EXECUTE` privileges.

## Integrating gh-ost with your Flask Application

The core idea is to trigger `gh-ost` commands from within your Flask application, typically as part of a deployment process or a dedicated management command. This allows you to automate schema migrations and integrate them seamlessly into your workflow.

**1. Setting up your Flask Application and MySQL Connection**

First, let's establish a basic Flask application with a MySQL connection using a popular library like `SQLAlchemy`. If you are using a different ORM, adapt the code accordingly.

```plaintext
# app.py
from flask import Flask
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+pymysql://user:password@host/database' # Replace with your credentials
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False # Suppress warning

engine = create_engine(app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'])
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(255))
    email = Column(String(255))

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # Create tables if they don't exist

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Important:** Replace `"mysql+pymysql://user:password@host/database"` with your actual MySQL connection string.

**2. Creating a Function to Execute gh-ost Commands**

We'll create a utility function to execute `gh-ost` commands using the `subprocess` module. This function will handle command execution, error handling, and logging.

```plaintext
# utils.py
import subprocess
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def execute_gh_ost_command(command):
    """
    Executes a gh-ost command.

    Args:
        command (list): A list of strings representing the gh-ost command.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the return code and the output of the command.
    """
    try:
        logging.info(f"Executing command: {' '.join(command)}")
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True) # check=True raises an exception on non-zero return code

        logging.info(f"Command completed successfully. Return code: {result.returncode}")
        logging.info(f"Command output: {result.stdout}")
        logging.error(f"Command error: {result.stderr}") #log stderr

        return result.returncode, result.stdout

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Command failed with return code: {e.returncode}")
        logging.error(f"Command output: {e.output}")
        logging.error(f"Command error: {e.stderr}")

        return e.returncode, e.output # Return output for error handling

    except FileNotFoundError:
        logging.error("gh-ost binary not found. Ensure it's in your PATH.")
        return 1, "gh-ost binary not found"

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return 1, str(e)
```

This function uses `subprocess.run` with `capture_output=True` to capture both standard output and standard error. The `check=True` argument ensures that an exception is raised if the command returns a non-zero exit code (indicating an error). The standard error is logged, as `gh-ost` often provides useful information through this channel.

**3. Implementing a Migration Function**

Now, we'll create a function that utilizes our `execute_gh_ost_command` function to perform a schema migration. This function will take the table name and the `ALTER TABLE` statement as input.

```plaintext
# migrations.py
from app import app  # Import your Flask app
from utils import execute_gh_ost_command
import os

def perform_gh_ost_migration(table_name, alter_statement):
    """
    Performs a gh-ost migration on the specified table.

    Args:
        table_name (str): The name of the table to migrate.
        alter_statement (str): The ALTER TABLE statement to apply.
    """

    #gh-ost needs database credentials
    db_user = app.config.get('SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI').split('://')[1].split(':')[0]
    db_password = app.config.get('SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI').split(':')[2].split('@')[0]
    db_host = app.config.get('SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI').split('@')[1].split('/')[0]
    db_name = app.config.get('SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI').split('/')[-1]

    command = [
        "gh-ost",
        "--database", db_name,
        "--table", table_name,
        "--alter", alter_statement,
        "--host", db_host,
        "--user", db_user,
        "--password", db_password,
        "--default-retries", "120", # Retry connecting for 10 minutes (120 * 5s)
        "--cut-over", "instant", # Cut over immediately after data copying
        "--throttle-query", "SELECT SLEEP(0.01)",  # Introduce a small delay to reduce load
        "--max-load", "Threads_running=50", # Stop or slow data copy if threads_running is too high
        "--switch-to-rbr", #Enforce row-based replication
        "--exact-rowcopy-lock",
        "--postpone-cut-over-flag-file", "/tmp/gh-ost.postpone" #Create this file to postpone cut-over
    ]
    #Optional flags
    if os.path.exists("/tmp/gh-ost.postpone"): #If the file exists, assume we want to avoid accidental cutovers
        command.remove("--cut-over")
        command.append("--postpone-cut-over-flag-file")
        command.append("/tmp/gh-ost.postpone")

    return_code, output = execute_gh_ost_command(command)

    if return_code != 0:
        print(f"Migration failed. Output: {output}") # Use print for visibility in command line

    else:
        print("Migration completed successfully.") # Use print for visibility in command line


# Example usage: (Add a new column 'age' to the 'users' table)
if __name__ == '__main__':
   from app import app
   with app.app_context():
        perform_gh_ost_migration("users", "ADD COLUMN age INT NULL")
```

**Explanation of `gh-ost` Flags:**

- `--database`: The database name.
- `--table`: The table name to migrate.
- `--alter`: The `ALTER TABLE` statement to apply.
- `--host`: The MySQL host.
- `--user`: The MySQL user.
- `--password`: The MySQL password.
- `--default-retries`: Number of connection retries.
- `--cut-over`: Determines when the cut-over should occur. `instant` migrates immediately.
- `--throttle-query`: A query that `gh-ost` executes to throttle the migration process. The `SLEEP(0.01)` introduces a small delay, reducing the load on the database.
- `--max-load`: Limits the load on the database by pausing or slowing down the migration if the `Threads_running` metric exceeds 50. Adapt this value based on your server's capacity. Other metrics like `queries_per_second` or `uptime_seconds` can also be used.
- `--switch-to-rbr`: Enforces Row-Based Replication. Essential for gh-ost to function correctly.
- `--exact-rowcopy-lock`: Avoids phantom rows
- `--postpone-cut-over-flag-file`: Prevents cut-over until the specified file is removed. Useful for testing and manual verification. This example checks for the existence of a flag file `/tmp/gh-ost.postpone` and postpones cutover if it exists. This allows for manual verification of the shadow table before the switch. Remove the flag file to proceed with the cutover: `rm /tmp/gh-ost.postpone`.

**4. Integrating with your Flask application using Flask's CLI**

Flask's CLI allows you to add custom commands that can be run from the command line. This is a good way to expose the `perform_gh_ost_migration` function.

```plaintext
# commands.py
import click
from flask import Flask
from migrations import perform_gh_ost_migration
from app import app

@app.cli.command("migrate-table")
@click.argument("table_name")
@click.argument("alter_statement")
def migrate_table_command(table_name, alter_statement):
    """
    Performs a gh-ost migration on the specified table.

    Usage: flask migrate-table <table_name> "<alter_statement>"
    """
    perform_gh_ost_migration(table_name, alter_statement)

# Register the command.  This can be done directly in app.py or a separate commands.py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Usage:**

To run the migration, execute the following command from your terminal:

```plaintext
flask migrate-table users "ADD COLUMN age INT NULL"
```

**5. Error Handling and Monitoring**

- **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to track the progress of the migration and identify any errors. The `utils.py` function already incorporates basic logging. Consider using a more sophisticated logging framework like `logging` in Python.

- **Monitoring:** Monitor your database server's performance during the migration. Pay attention to CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic. Tools like `MySQL Workbench`, `Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)`, or cloud provider monitoring services can be helpful.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle migration failures. If a migration fails, rollback the changes and notify the appropriate personnel. The `subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception in `utils.py` provides a starting point for error handling. Consider adding more specific error handling based on the `gh-ost` output.

- **gh-ost's own Status:** Use the `gh-ost status` command for a running migration. This command shows progress, estimates time remaining, and any errors encountered. You can wrap this command in your Python script.

**6. Best Practices**

- **Test Thoroughly:** Before running a migration on your production database, thoroughly test it on a staging or development environment.
- **Start Small:** Begin with small, non-critical migrations to gain experience with `gh-ost`.
- **Monitor Performance:** Continuously monitor your database server's performance during the migration and adjust the throttling settings as needed.
- **Automate:** Automate the migration process as much as possible to reduce the risk of human error. Consider using a CI/CD pipeline to trigger migrations.
- **Backups:** Always create a backup of your database before performing any schema migrations.
- **Understand Gh-ost limitations:** gh-ost has limitations. For instance, it does not currently support renaming columns or changing column types in place. Certain types of foreign key relationships may also cause issues. Always consult the gh-ost documentation and test your migrations thoroughly.
- **Control and Monitor using web UI:** Consider exposing endpoints in your Flask App to control gh-ost flags and see progress. Using `flask-admin` or similar packages to auto-generate UIs is a quick way to do this.
- **Avoid LONG running Transactions:** Ensure no long-running transactions (e.g., reports, batch processes) are running during the migration, as they can conflict with gh-ost's operation and extend the data copy time significantly.

## Example: Adding an Index

Let's say you want to add an index to the `email` column of the `users` table. The following `ALTER TABLE` statement can be used:

```plaintext
ALTER TABLE users ADD INDEX idx_email (email);
```

You would then call the `perform_gh_ost_migration` function like this:

```plaintext
from migrations import perform_gh_ost_migration

# within your Flask app context
perform_gh_ost_migration("users", "ADD INDEX idx_email (email)")
```

## Conclusion

`gh-ost` provides a powerful solution for performing zero-downtime schema migrations in MySQL. By integrating `gh-ost` with your Flask application, you can automate these migrations and reduce the risk of downtime. Remember to test thoroughly, monitor performance, and follow best practices to ensure a smooth and successful migration. By carefully considering your database load, the complexity of the schema change, and potential edge cases, you can leverage `gh-ost` to keep your Flask application running smoothly during schema updates.
