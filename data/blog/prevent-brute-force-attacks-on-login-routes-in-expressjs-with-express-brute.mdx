# Prevent Brute-Force Attacks on Login Routes in Express.js with express-brute

Brute-force attacks are a common threat to web applications, where attackers attempt to guess login credentials by systematically trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords. Protecting your login routes is crucial for securing user accounts and preventing unauthorized access. This blog post will guide you through implementing a robust defense against brute-force attacks in your Express.js applications using the `express-brute` middleware.

## Understanding Brute-Force Attacks

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly understand what a brute-force attack entails. An attacker might use automated tools or scripts to repeatedly submit login requests with different username and password combinations. They continue this process until they successfully guess the correct credentials or exhaust all possible combinations. The speed and automation of these attacks make them highly effective if not properly mitigated.

## Introducing `express-brute`

`express-brute` is a popular Node.js middleware designed to prevent brute-force attacks by implementing rate limiting. It tracks the number of failed login attempts from a specific source (e.g., IP address) and blocks further requests after a certain threshold is reached. This effectively slows down attackers and makes brute-force attacks impractical.

### Key Features of `express-brute`:

*   **Rate Limiting:** Limits the number of requests allowed from a specific IP address or username within a specified time frame.
*   **Storage Options:** Supports various storage options for tracking failed attempts, including memory, Redis, and Memcached.
*   **Flexibility:** Highly configurable, allowing you to customize the rate limiting thresholds, storage options, and error handling.
*   **Custom Error Messages:** Allows you to define custom error messages to provide informative feedback to users.
*   **Whitelist/Blacklist:** Option to create whitelists/blacklists for specific IP addresses or usernames that bypass the rate limiting rules.

## Setting Up Your Express.js Application

First, let's set up a basic Express.js application. If you already have one, you can skip this step.

1.  **Create a new project directory:**

    ```bash
    mkdir express-brute-example
    cd express-brute-example
    ```

2.  **Initialize the project:**

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3.  **Install Express.js and `express-brute`:**

    ```bash
    npm install express express-brute body-parser
    ```

4.  **Create an `index.js` file:**

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
    app.use(bodyParser.json());

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```

## Implementing `express-brute`

Now, let's integrate `express-brute` into our application to protect the login route. We'll use the memory store for simplicity in this example, but consider using a persistent store like Redis or Memcached in a production environment.

1.  **Install a store for express-brute (e.g., memory store):**

    The memory store is built-in to `express-brute`, so no need to install separately for a simple example. For production use, consider using Redis or Memcached.  To use Redis, for example: `npm install express-brute redis`

2.  **Require `express-brute` and create a store:**

    ```javascript
    const expressBrute = require('express-brute');
    // Use memory store for demo purposes, replace with Redis or Memcached in production
    const MemoryStore = expressBrute.MemoryStore;
    const store = new MemoryStore();
    ```

3.  **Create an `expressBrute` instance:**

    ```javascript
    const bruteforce = new expressBrute(store, {
        freeRetries: 5, // Allow 5 retries per period
        minWait: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
        maxWait: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
        lifetime: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours - how long to remember that the user is locked out.
        refreshTimeoutOnRequest: false, // refresh the timeout after each request? False for login routes.
        handleStoreError: function (message, parent) {
            console.log(message);
        },
        failCallback: function (req, res, next, nextValidRequestDate) {
            res.status(429).send({
                message: 'Too many failed attempts, please try again in ' + Math.ceil((nextValidRequestDate.getTime() - Date.now())/60000) + ' minutes.'
            });
        }
    });
    ```

    *   `freeRetries`: Number of free retries allowed before rate limiting kicks in.
    *   `minWait`: Minimum wait time (in milliseconds) after exceeding the free retries.
    *   `maxWait`: Maximum wait time (in milliseconds) after multiple failures. The wait increases with each failed attempt, up to this maximum.
    *   `lifetime`: Time (in seconds) to remember that a user is locked out
    *   `refreshTimeoutOnRequest`: If the timeout should be refreshed after each request.
    *   `handleStoreError`: Error handling callback for store related issues.
    *   `failCallback`:  A function to execute upon blocking

4.  **Create a mock login route:**

    ```javascript
    app.post('/login', bruteforce.prevent, (req, res) => {
        // Simulate authentication
        const { username, password } = req.body;

        // In a real application, you would validate the username and password against a database.
        if (username === 'testuser' && password === 'password') {
            res.send('Login successful!');
        } else {
            // Simulate a failed login attempt
            res.status(401).send('Invalid username or password');
        }
    });
    ```

    *   `bruteforce.prevent`: This middleware applies the rate limiting logic to the `/login` route.

5.  **Complete `index.js` example:**

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    const expressBrute = require('express-brute');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
    app.use(bodyParser.json());

    // Use memory store for demo purposes, replace with Redis or Memcached in production
    const MemoryStore = expressBrute.MemoryStore;
    const store = new MemoryStore();

    const bruteforce = new expressBrute(store, {
        freeRetries: 5, // Allow 5 retries per period
        minWait: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
        maxWait: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
        lifetime: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours - how long to remember that the user is locked out.
        refreshTimeoutOnRequest: false, // refresh the timeout after each request? False for login routes.
        handleStoreError: function (message, parent) {
            console.log(message);
        },
        failCallback: function (req, res, next, nextValidRequestDate) {
            res.status(429).send({
                message: 'Too many failed attempts, please try again in ' + Math.ceil((nextValidRequestDate.getTime() - Date.now())/60000) + ' minutes.'
            });
        }
    });

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.post('/login', bruteforce.prevent, (req, res) => {
        // Simulate authentication
        const { username, password } = req.body;

        // In a real application, you would validate the username and password against a database.
        if (username === 'testuser' && password === 'password') {
            res.send('Login successful!');
        } else {
            // Simulate a failed login attempt
            res.status(401).send('Invalid username or password');
        }
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```

6.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Testing the Implementation

You can use tools like Postman or `curl` to test the login route and verify that `express-brute` is correctly blocking requests after exceeding the allowed retries.

**Example using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "wronguser", "password": "wrongpassword"}' http://localhost:3000/login
```

Try sending this request more than 5 times in quick succession. After the 5th attempt, you should receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error with a message indicating the wait time.

## Configuration Options

`express-brute` offers a variety of configuration options to customize its behavior to suit your application's needs. Here are some key options:

*   **`store`:** Specifies the storage to use for tracking failed attempts (e.g., `MemoryStore`, `RedisStore`, `MemcachedStore`).
*   **`freeRetries`:**  Number of free retries allowed before rate limiting kicks in.
*   **`minWait`:**  Minimum wait time (in milliseconds) after exceeding the free retries.
*   **`maxWait`:**  Maximum wait time (in milliseconds) after multiple failures. The wait increases with each failed attempt, up to this maximum.
*   **`lifetime`:**  How long to remember that the user is locked out
*   **`attachResetRoute`**: If set to `true` an additional route will be created which deletes/resets your IP address from the store.

## Considerations for Production Environments

*   **Use a Persistent Store:**  In production, always use a persistent store like Redis or Memcached to ensure that rate limiting persists across server restarts. Memory stores are only suitable for development or testing.
*   **Monitor and Adjust Thresholds:**  Monitor your application's login attempts and adjust the `freeRetries`, `minWait`, and `maxWait` values based on your traffic patterns and security requirements.
*   **Implement Captcha:**  Consider implementing CAPTCHA challenges after a certain number of failed attempts to further mitigate automated attacks.
*   **Logging and Alerting:**  Log failed login attempts and set up alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity.

## Enhancing Security Beyond Brute-Force Protection

While `express-brute` effectively protects against brute-force attacks, it's essential to implement a comprehensive security strategy that includes:

*   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity, special characters).
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Implement 2FA to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
*   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
