# How to Fix ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID: A Comprehensive Guide

The "ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID" error in your browser signifies a problem with the SSL/TLS certificate of the website you're trying to access. This error message essentially means your browser doesn't trust the certificate authority (CA) that issued the website's SSL certificate. While this doesn't automatically mean the website is malicious, it does indicate a potential security risk, and it's crucial to understand and address it.  This article provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to troubleshooting and fixing this error.

## Understanding the "ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID" Error

Before diving into the fixes, let's understand what's causing this error. SSL/TLS certificates are digital certificates that verify the identity of a website and encrypt communication between the website and your browser. These certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). When your browser encounters a website with an SSL certificate, it checks:

1.  **Validity:**  Whether the certificate is within its valid date range.
2.  **Issuer:** Whether the certificate was issued by a trusted CA.
3.  **Hostname:** Whether the certificate's domain name matches the website's address.

The `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` error specifically arises when the browser doesn't recognize or trust the CA that issued the certificate. This can happen for several reasons:

*   **Self-Signed Certificates:** The website uses a self-signed certificate, meaning it wasn't issued by a recognized CA.  These are often used in development or internal environments.
*   **Untrusted Root Certificate:** The browser doesn't have the root certificate of the CA installed in its trusted root certificate store.
*   **Outdated Browser or Operating System:** Older browsers and operating systems may not have the latest list of trusted CAs.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**  A malicious actor is intercepting your connection and presenting a fake certificate.  This is less common, but important to consider.
*   **Firewall or Antivirus Interference:**  Your firewall or antivirus software might be interfering with the SSL connection.
*   **Certificate Mismatch:** The website's certificate may be intended for a different domain name.
*   **Expired Certificate:** The certificate may have expired. This will generate a different error usually.
*   **Certificate Revoked:** The certificate may have been revoked by the CA.  This is rare.
*   **Local System Clock Incorrect:** An incorrect date and time on your computer can cause certificate validation to fail, as the browser may believe the certificate is not yet valid or is already expired.

## Troubleshooting and Fixing the "ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID" Error

Here's a comprehensive list of solutions, starting with the simplest and most common fixes:

**1. Check Your System Date and Time:**

An incorrect date and time can lead to certificate validation errors. Make sure your system clock is synchronized with an internet time server.

*   **Windows:** Go to Settings > Time & Language > Date & Time. Ensure "Set time automatically" is enabled. If not, manually set the correct date and time.
*   **macOS:** Go to System Preferences > Date & Time. Ensure "Set date and time automatically" is checked. If not, manually set the correct date and time.

**2. Try a Different Browser:**

If you're encountering the error in one browser, try accessing the website in another (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). This helps determine if the issue is specific to your browser's configuration or a more widespread problem.

**3. Clear Your Browser's Cache and Cookies:**

Cached data and cookies can sometimes interfere with SSL certificate validation. Clear your browser's cache and cookies.

*   **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData` or click the three dots menu > More tools > Clear browsing data. Select "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files," then click "Clear data."
*   **Firefox:** Go to `about:preferences#privacy` or click the three lines menu > Options > Privacy & Security. Under "Cookies and Site Data," click "Clear Data." Select "Cookies and Site Data" and "Cached Web Content," then click "Clear."
*   **Edge:** Go to `edge://settings/clearBrowserData` or click the three dots menu > Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear browsing data. Select "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files," then click "Clear now."
*   **Safari:**  Go to Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data.  Remove the data for the website in question. You can also clear all history by going to History > Clear History.

**4. Disable Browser Extensions:**

Some browser extensions, particularly those related to security or privacy, can interfere with SSL certificate validation. Temporarily disable your browser extensions to see if that resolves the issue.

*   **Chrome:** Go to `chrome://extensions/` or click the three dots menu > More tools > Extensions. Toggle the switches to disable extensions.
*   **Firefox:** Go to `about:addons` or click the three lines menu > Add-ons > Extensions. Disable extensions.
*   **Edge:** Go to `edge://extensions/` or click the three dots menu > Extensions. Toggle the switches to disable extensions.

**5. Check Your Antivirus and Firewall Settings:**

Your antivirus or firewall software might be interfering with the SSL connection. Temporarily disable your antivirus or firewall to see if that resolves the error. *Be cautious when disabling these, and re-enable them as soon as you've tested the website.*

**6. Temporarily Disable SSL/TLS Scanning (Advanced Users Only - Use with Caution):**

Some antivirus programs have a feature that scans SSL/TLS traffic. This can sometimes interfere with certificate validation. If you are comfortable doing so, you can try disabling SSL/TLS scanning in your antivirus software. **However, be aware that this reduces your security and should only be done for troubleshooting purposes and re-enabled immediately after testing.** Consult your antivirus software's documentation for instructions on how to disable SSL/TLS scanning.  *This is a risky step and should be considered only when others have failed and you are comfortable with the potential security implications.*

**7. Clear the SSL State (Windows Only):**

Clearing the SSL state in Windows can sometimes resolve certificate issues.

*   Open the Control Panel.
*   Go to Network and Internet > Internet Options.
*   Click the "Content" tab.
*   Click "Clear SSL state."

**8. Add the Certificate to Your Trusted Root Certification Authorities (Advanced Users Only - Use with Caution):**

*   **Warning:** Only do this if you are *absolutely certain* the website is safe and the certificate is legitimate.  Adding an untrusted certificate to your trusted store poses a significant security risk. This should **ONLY** be done for internal or development environments where you control the certificate.

    1.  **Export the Certificate:** In your browser, when you encounter the error, you should be able to view the certificate details. Look for an option to export the certificate (often as a `.cer` or `.pem` file).

    2.  **Import the Certificate (Windows):**

        *   Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) by typing `mmc` in the Run dialog box (Windows key + R).
        *   Go to File > Add/Remove Snap-in.
        *   Select "Certificates" and click "Add."
        *   Choose "Computer account" and click "Next."
        *   Choose "Local computer" and click "Finish."
        *   Click "OK" to close the Add/Remove Snap-in dialog box.
        *   Expand "Certificates (Local Computer)" > "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" > "Certificates."
        *   Right-click in the right pane, go to "All Tasks" > "Import."
        *   Follow the wizard to import the certificate file you exported.

    3.  **Import the Certificate (macOS):**

        *   Open Keychain Access (located in /Applications/Utilities/).
        *   Drag and drop the certificate file into Keychain Access.
        *   The certificate will be added to the "login" keychain.
        *   Double-click the certificate.
        *   Expand the "Trust" section.
        *   In the "When using this certificate" dropdown, select "Always Trust."
        *   Close the certificate window.  You will be prompted to enter your administrator password.

    **Again, use this method with extreme caution and only if you understand the security implications.**

**9. Check for Malware:**

Run a full system scan with your antivirus software to check for malware that might be interfering with your internet connection or certificate validation.

**10. Update Your Browser:**

Ensure you are using the latest version of your browser. Outdated browsers may not have the latest security updates and trusted CA lists.

*   **Chrome:** Click the three dots menu > Help > About Google Chrome. Chrome will automatically check for and install updates.
*   **Firefox:** Click the three lines menu > Help > About Firefox. Firefox will automatically check for and install updates.
*   **Edge:** Click the three dots menu > Help and feedback > About Microsoft Edge. Edge will automatically check for and install updates.
*   **Safari:** Updates are usually delivered through macOS system updates. Go to System Preferences > Software Update.

**11. Update Your Operating System:**

Similar to outdated browsers, outdated operating systems may also lack the latest trusted CA lists.  Install any available operating system updates.

**12. Inspect the Certificate Details (For Advanced Troubleshooting):**

When you encounter the `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` error, your browser typically allows you to view the certificate details.  Examine these details carefully:

*   **Issuer:**  Who issued the certificate?  Is it a recognized Certificate Authority?
*   **Valid From/Valid To:** Is the certificate within its validity period?
*   **Subject Alternative Name (SAN):** Does the certificate cover the domain name you're trying to access?  This is particularly important for websites using multiple subdomains.
*   **Certificate Path:**  The certificate path shows the chain of trust, from the root CA to the website's certificate.  If there are any missing or untrusted certificates in the chain, it can cause the error.

This information can provide clues about the underlying problem.

**13.  For Website Owners:**

If you own the website encountering this error, you need to take different steps:

*   **Ensure you have a valid SSL certificate from a trusted CA:**  Purchase a certificate from a reputable provider like Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, Comodo, or GlobalSign.
*   **Install the certificate correctly on your server:**  Follow your hosting provider's instructions for installing the SSL certificate.
*   **Configure your server to use HTTPS:**  Make sure your website is properly configured to use HTTPS.
*   **Check your website's configuration:**  Use online SSL checkers (e.g., SSL Labs SSL Server Test: [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)) to identify any configuration issues.
*   **Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  A CDN can help improve your website's performance and security, including SSL/TLS configuration.

**14. Ignore the Error (Not Recommended for General Browsing):**

Browsers allow you to proceed to the website despite the `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` error.  *This is highly discouraged for general browsing* because it bypasses the security warnings and exposes you to potential risks. Only proceed if you understand the risks and are absolutely certain the website is safe (e.g., internal development environment).  The specific steps to bypass the error vary by browser:

*   **Chrome:** Click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to [website address] (unsafe)."
*   **Firefox:** Click "Advanced..." and then "Accept the Risk and Continue."
*   **Edge:** Click "Advanced" and then "Continue to [website address] (unsafe)."

**15. Check Your DNS Settings:**

In rare cases, incorrect DNS settings can lead to certificate validation issues. Try flushing your DNS cache:

*   **Windows:** Open the Command Prompt and run `ipconfig /flushdns`
*   **macOS:** Open the Terminal and run `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`

You can also try changing your DNS servers to a public DNS server like Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1).

**16. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network):**

In some instances, particularly when traveling or using public Wi-Fi, a VPN can help bypass network-related certificate issues.  However, choose a reputable VPN provider.

## Code Examples (For Developers - Related to Self-Signed Certificates and Internal Environments)

If you're developing an application and using a self-signed certificate for development purposes, you might encounter this error.  Here's how to handle it in some common scenarios:

**Node.js (Using `https` module):**

```javascript
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/private.key'), // Path to your private key
  cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/certificate.crt'), // Path to your certificate
};

const server = https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello, HTTPS!');
});

server.listen(443, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 443');
});
```

**Important Considerations for Self-Signed Certificates:**

*   **Never use self-signed certificates in production environments.**
*   Always generate a strong private key.
*   Follow best practices for certificate management.
