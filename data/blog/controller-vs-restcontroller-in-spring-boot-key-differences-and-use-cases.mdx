# @Controller vs @RestController in Spring Boot: Key Differences & Use Cases

When building web applications and RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, you'll encounter two crucial annotations: `@Controller` and `@RestController`. While both are used to define components that handle incoming HTTP requests, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Understanding these differences is essential for designing robust and efficient Spring Boot applications.

This post delves into the core differences between `@Controller` and `@RestController`, explores their use cases, and provides code examples to illustrate their functionality. By the end, you'll be equipped to choose the right annotation for your specific needs.

## Understanding @Controller

The `@Controller` annotation is a fundamental building block in Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications. It signals to Spring that a class is a controller, responsible for handling user requests, processing data, and returning a view (typically an HTML page) to the user.

**Key characteristics of `@Controller`:**

*   **Returns Views:**  By default, methods within a `@Controller` are expected to return the name of a view.  Spring MVC then uses a `ViewResolver` to locate and render the appropriate view template (e.g., Thymeleaf, JSP, Freemarker).
*   **MVC Architecture:**  It's deeply integrated with the MVC pattern, separating concerns between the model (data), view (presentation), and controller (logic).
*   **Handles User Interfaces:**  Typically used for building traditional web applications where the server renders the HTML and sends it to the client.

**Example of using `@Controller`:**

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting(@RequestParam(name="name", required=false, defaultValue="World") String name, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", name);
        return "greeting"; // Returns the name of the view (e.g., greeting.html)
    }
}
```

In this example:

*   `@Controller` marks the `GreetingController` class as a controller.
*   `@GetMapping("/greeting")` maps the `/greeting` URL to the `greeting` method.
*   `@RequestParam` retrieves a query parameter named "name".
*   `Model model` allows you to add attributes to the model, which are then accessible in the view.
*   `return "greeting";`  returns the logical view name "greeting."  The `ViewResolver` will use this name to find the corresponding template (e.g., `greeting.html` in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory).

**Example `greeting.html` (using Thymeleaf):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <p th:text="'Hello, ' + ${name} + '!'" />
</body>
</html>
```

## Understanding @RestController

The `@RestController` annotation is a specialized version of `@Controller` that is designed for building RESTful APIs. It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, simplifying the process of returning data directly in the HTTP response body.

**Key characteristics of `@RestController`:**

*   **Returns Data Directly:**  Methods within a `@RestController` are expected to return data that will be serialized into a format like JSON or XML and sent directly in the response body.  You don't need to specify a view name.
*   **RESTful API Development:**  Optimized for building APIs that adhere to REST principles, focusing on resources and standard HTTP methods.
*   **@ResponseBody Implicitly Applied:**  Automatically applies the `@ResponseBody` annotation to all handler methods, meaning no explicit `@ResponseBody` annotation is needed for each method.
*   **Data Serialization:** Leverages Spring's `HttpMessageConverter` implementations to automatically convert Java objects into formats like JSON or XML.  Jackson is a common library used for JSON serialization.

**Example of using `@RestController`:**

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloRestController {

    @GetMapping("/hello/{name}")
    public String hello(@PathVariable String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!"; // Returns a String that will be converted to JSON
    }

    @GetMapping("/user")
    public User getUser() {
        return new User("John", "Doe"); // Returns a User object that will be converted to JSON
    }

    static class User {
        private String firstName;
        private String lastName;

        public User(String firstName, String lastName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }

        public String getFirstName() {
            return firstName;
        }

        public String getLastName() {
            return lastName;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

*   `@RestController` marks the `HelloRestController` class as a REST controller.
*   `@GetMapping("/hello/{name}")` maps the `/hello/{name}` URL to the `hello` method.  `@PathVariable` extracts the value of the `name` path variable.
*   The `hello` method returns a simple string, which will be converted to a JSON string (e.g., `"Hello, Alice!"`).
*   The `getUser` method returns a `User` object, which will be automatically serialized into JSON.  For example: `{"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"}`.

## Key Differences Summarized

| Feature          | `@Controller`                                         | `@RestController`                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Return Type      | View name (logical name of a template)             | Data (typically serialized to JSON or XML)        |
| `@ResponseBody`   | Not implicitly applied.  Needs to be added to each method if needed. | Implicitly applied to all handler methods.           |
| Purpose          | Building web applications with server-side rendering | Building RESTful APIs                             |
| MVC Architecture | Core component of the MVC pattern                  | Designed for API development, often bypassing views |

## When to Use Which Annotation

*   **Use `@Controller` when:**

    *   You're building a traditional web application where the server renders HTML and sends it to the client.
    *   You need to return views (HTML pages) to the user.
    *   You want to leverage the full power of Spring MVC, including view resolvers and template engines.
    *   You are not building a purely API-driven application and need to serve static content or full HTML pages.

*   **Use `@RestController` when:**

    *   You're building a RESTful API that exposes data as JSON or XML.
    *   You need to return data directly in the HTTP response body.
    *   You're developing a backend for a single-page application (SPA) or a mobile app.
    *   You want a simplified and streamlined approach to building APIs.

## Combining @Controller and @RestController

It's possible to use both `@Controller` and `@RestController` in the same Spring Boot application. For example, you might have a `@Controller` for serving the main application UI and `@RestController` endpoints for providing data to the UI or external services.

## Choosing the Right Approach

The choice between `@Controller` and `@RestController` depends on the specific requirements of your application.  If you're building a traditional web application with server-side rendering, `@Controller` is the natural choice.  If you're building a RESTful API, `@RestController` is the preferred option. Understanding these nuances allows you to build clean, maintainable, and efficient Spring Boot applications. Remember to consider your application's architecture, target audience, and data delivery methods when making your decision.
