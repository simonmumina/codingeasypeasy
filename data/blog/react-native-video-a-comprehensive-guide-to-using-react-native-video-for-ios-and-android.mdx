# React Native Video: A Comprehensive Guide to Using `react-native-video` for iOS and Android

`react-native-video` is a powerful and versatile React Native component for playing videos on both iOS and Android platforms. It provides a simple yet highly customizable interface for integrating video playback functionality into your mobile applications.  This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from installation to advanced features, to get you up and running with `react-native-video`.

## Why Use `react-native-video`?

While there are other video player solutions for React Native, `react-native-video` stands out due to its:

*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android.
*   **Native Performance:**  Leverages native video player components for optimal performance and battery efficiency.
*   **Customization Options:**  Offers extensive customization options for styling, controls, and behavior.
*   **Streaming Support:**  Handles various video streaming protocols, including HLS and DASH.
*   **Active Community:**  Benefit from a large and active community, ensuring continuous support and updates.

## Installation and Setup

Before diving into the code, let's install `react-native-video` in your React Native project:

**1. Install the Package:**

```bash
npm install react-native-video
# OR
yarn add react-native-video
```

**2. Link the Native Dependencies (React Native >= 0.60 Autolinking):**

For React Native versions 0.60 and above, autolinking should automatically handle linking the native dependencies.  However, sometimes it's necessary to manually link, especially when dealing with specific native modules or encountering issues. To manually link:

```bash
npx react-native link react-native-video
```

**3. iOS Specific Setup:**

*   **CocoaPods:** If your iOS project uses CocoaPods (which it likely does), navigate to your `ios` directory and run:

    ```bash
    cd ios
    pod install
    ```

*   **ATS Configuration:**  For iOS 9 and later, you might need to configure App Transport Security (ATS) to allow access to non-HTTPS video URLs.  This is generally **not recommended for production** but helpful during development. To disable ATS, add the following to your `Info.plist` file (found in the `ios/<YourProject>` directory in Xcode):

    ```xml
    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
    ```

    **Important:** In a production environment, you should always use HTTPS video URLs and configure ATS to only allow access to specific domains. For example:

    ```xml
    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
        <dict>
            <key>yourdomain.com</key>
            <dict>
                <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
                <true/>
                <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
                <true/>
                <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
                <false/>
            </dict>
        </dict>
    </dict>
    ```

    Replace `yourdomain.com` with the actual domain of your video server.

**4. Android Specific Setup:**

*   **Permissions:** `react-native-video` automatically requests the necessary permissions (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) on Android.  You might need to manually add internet permission if your AndroidManifest.xml does not have it.

*   **Troubleshooting:**  Sometimes, building the Android project fails with "Could not find method android() for arguments". This might indicate an outdated Gradle version.  Try updating your Gradle version in `android/build.gradle`.  Refer to the React Native documentation for instructions on updating Gradle.

## Basic Usage: Playing a Video

Now that we have `react-native-video` installed and configured, let's create a simple video player component:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import Video from 'react-native-video';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  backgroundVideo: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    right: 0,
  },
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});

const VideoPlayer = () => {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const [paused, setPaused] = useState(false);

  const togglePlay = () => {
    setPaused(!paused);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Video
        source={{ uri: 'https://yourdomain.com/yourvideo.mp4' }} // Replace with your video URL
        ref={videoRef}
        style={styles.backgroundVideo}
        controls={true} // Show controls
        paused={paused}
        resizeMode="contain" // or 'cover', 'stretch', 'center'
        onError={(error) => console.error('Video Error:', error)}
      />
      <Button title={paused ? 'Play' : 'Pause'} onPress={togglePlay} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default VideoPlayer;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`import Video from 'react-native-video';`**: Imports the `Video` component.
*   **`source={{ uri: '...' }}`**:  Specifies the URL of the video to play.  **Replace `'https://yourdomain.com/yourvideo.mp4'` with the actual URL of your video file.**
*   **`style={styles.backgroundVideo}`**:  Applies styles to position the video player.  The example sets it to fill the entire container.
*   **`controls={true}`**:  Enables the default video player controls (play/pause, volume, progress bar, fullscreen).
*   **`paused={paused}`**:  Controls whether the video is paused or playing.  Uses a `useState` hook to manage the paused state.
*   **`resizeMode="contain"`**:  Determines how the video is resized to fit the player.  `'contain'` ensures the video is fully visible, potentially with letterboxing. Other options include `'cover'` (fills the container, cropping if necessary), `'stretch'` (stretches the video to fill the container, potentially distorting the aspect ratio), and `'center'` (centers the video without resizing).
*   **`onError={(error) => console.error('Video Error:', error)}`**:  Handles video playback errors.  It's crucial to implement error handling to provide a better user experience.
*   **`ref={videoRef}`**: A ref is created to access the underlying video player instance. This allows you to programmatically control the video (play, pause, seek, etc.).
*   **Toggle Button:** The button allows to pause and resume the video.

## Advanced Features and Customization

`react-native-video` offers a wide range of advanced features and customization options:

*   **Callback Functions:**

    *   **`onLoad`**:  Called when the video metadata has loaded (duration, dimensions, etc.).
    *   **`onProgress`**:  Called periodically with information about the current playback position.  This is useful for updating a progress bar.
    *   **`onEnd`**:  Called when the video reaches the end.
    *   **`onError`**:  Called when an error occurs during playback.
    *   **`onBuffer`**: Called when the video starts or stops buffering.

    Example using `onProgress` to update a progress bar:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
    import { View, StyleSheet, Slider } from 'react-native';
    import Video from 'react-native-video';

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',
      },
      video: {
        width: 320,
        height: 240,
      },
    });

    const CustomVideoPlayer = () => {
      const videoRef = useRef(null);
      const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
      const [duration, setDuration] = useState(0);

      const handleProgress = (data) => {
        setProgress(data.currentTime / duration);
      };

      const handleLoad = (data) => {
        setDuration(data.duration);
      };

      const handleSeek = (value) => {
        if (videoRef.current) {
          videoRef.current.seek(value * duration);
        }
      };

      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Video
            source={{ uri: 'https://yourdomain.com/yourvideo.mp4' }}
            ref={videoRef}
            style={styles.video}
            controls={true}
            onProgress={handleProgress}
            onLoad={handleLoad}
          />
          <Slider
            value={progress}
            onValueChange={handleSeek}
          />
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default CustomVideoPlayer;
    ```

*   **Styling:**  Customize the video player's appearance using standard React Native styling techniques.  You can style the container, the video itself, and even the default controls (although customizing the default controls is limited).  For more advanced control over the UI, you'll likely want to create custom controls.

*   **Fullscreen Mode:**  `react-native-video` doesn't provide built-in fullscreen support.  You'll need to implement your own fullscreen functionality using React Native's `StatusBar` API and by dynamically adjusting the video player's size and position.  Libraries like `react-native-orientation-locker` can help with handling screen orientation changes.

*   **Streaming:**  `react-native-video` supports various streaming protocols, including HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) and DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP).  Simply provide the URL of the HLS or DASH manifest file in the `source` prop.  The player will automatically handle the streaming logic.

*   **Volume Control:**  Use the `volume` prop to control the video volume (a value between 0 and 1).

*   **Rate Control:**  Use the `rate` prop to control the playback speed (e.g., 0.5 for half speed, 2 for double speed).

*   **Muted:**  Use the `muted` prop to mute the video.

*   **Repeat:**  Use the `repeat` prop to loop the video.

*   **Picture-in-Picture (PiP):**  While not directly supported by `react-native-video`, implementing PiP requires native code bridges for iOS and Android to use native APIs for PiP support.

## Example: Custom Video Player with Play/Pause, Progress Bar, and Fullscreen

This more elaborate example demonstrates how to build a custom video player with play/pause, a progress bar, and basic fullscreen functionality (without handling rotation).

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity, Text, Slider, Dimensions, StatusBar } from 'react-native';
import Video from 'react-native-video';
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/FontAwesome'; // Install: yarn add react-native-vector-icons

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  videoContainer: {
    width: width,
    height: height / 3, // Adjust height as needed
  },
  video: {
    ...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject,
  },
  controlsContainer: {
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)',
    padding: 10,
    position: 'absolute',
    bottom: 0,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'space-between',
  },
  playButton: {
    padding: 10,
  },
  progress: {
    flex: 1,
    marginHorizontal: 10,
  },
  timeText: {
    color: 'white',
    fontSize: 12,
  },
  fullscreenButton: {
    padding: 10,
  },
});

const formatTime = (seconds) => {
  const minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
  const remainingSeconds = Math.floor(seconds % 60);
  return `${minutes}:${remainingSeconds < 10 ? '0' : ''}${remainingSeconds}`;
};

const CustomVideoPlayer = () => {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);
  const [paused, setPaused] = useState(true);
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
  const [duration, setDuration] = useState(0);
  const [currentTime, setCurrentTime] = useState(0);
  const [fullscreen, setFullscreen] = useState(false);

  const handlePlayPause = () => {
    setPaused(!paused);
  };

  const handleProgress = (data) => {
    setProgress(data.currentTime / duration);
    setCurrentTime(data.currentTime);
  };

  const handleLoad = (data) => {
    setDuration(data.duration);
  };

  const handleSeek = (value) => {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      videoRef.current.seek(value * duration);
    }
  };

  const handleFullscreen = () => {
    setFullscreen(!fullscreen);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <StatusBar hidden={fullscreen} />
      <View style={[styles.videoContainer, fullscreen ? { width: width, height: height } : {}]}>
        <Video
          source={{ uri: 'https://yourdomain.com/yourvideo.mp4' }}
          ref={videoRef}
          style={styles.video}
          paused={paused}
          resizeMode="contain"
          onProgress={handleProgress}
          onLoad={handleLoad}
          onError={(error) => console.error("Video Error: ", error)}
        />

        <View style={styles.controlsContainer}>
          <TouchableOpacity style={styles.playButton} onPress={handlePlayPause}>
            <Icon name={paused ? 'play' : 'pause'} size={20} color="white" />
          </TouchableOpacity>

          <Text style={styles.timeText}>{formatTime(currentTime)}</Text>

          <Slider
            style={styles.progress}
            minimumValue={0}
            maximumValue={1}
            value={progress}
            onValueChange={handleSeek}
            minimumTrackTintColor="#FFFFFF"
            maximumTrackTintColor="#000000"
          />

          <Text style={styles.timeText}>{formatTime(duration)}</Text>

          <TouchableOpacity style={styles.fullscreenButton} onPress={handleFullscreen}>
            <Icon name={fullscreen ? 'compress' : 'expand'} size={20} color="white" />
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

export default CustomVideoPlayer;

```

**Explanation of the Custom Video Player:**

*   **Imports:** Includes necessary components and the `Icon` component from `react-native-vector-icons` (you'll need to install this library: `yarn add react-native-vector-icons`).
*   **Styling:**  Defines styles for the video player, controls, and other elements.
*   **`useState` Hooks:** Manages the state of the player (paused, progress, duration, fullscreen).
*   **`handlePlayPause`:** Toggles the paused state.
*   **`handleProgress`:** Updates the progress bar and current time.
*   **`handleLoad`:** Sets the video duration when the video is loaded.
*   **`handleSeek`:** Seeks to a specific position in the video.
*   **`handleFullscreen`:** Toggles fullscreen mode.
*   **`formatTime`:** Helper function to format time in minutes and seconds.
*   **Conditional Styles:**  The `videoContainer` style is dynamically adjusted based on the `fullscreen` state.
*   **`react-native-vector-icons`:**  The play/pause and fullscreen icons are displayed using the react-native-vector-icons package.

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Clearer Styling:**  More organized and readable styles.
*   **Time Display:** Displays the current time and duration of the video.
*   **Fullscreen Toggle:** Basic fullscreen functionality (adjusts the size of the video container).  A robust fullscreen implementation would also handle screen orientation changes and potentially use native APIs for a smoother transition.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes an `onError` handler.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Video not found" or "Network error"**: Double-check the video URL.  Ensure that the URL is accessible from your device and that your device has a stable internet connection.  Verify that your ATS settings are correct on iOS.
*   **"Can't find variable: requireNativeComponent" or similar linking errors**: Ensure that you have correctly linked the native dependencies using `react-native link react-native-video`. Clean your build folder in Xcode (Product -> Clean Build Folder) or rebuild your Android project.
*   **Video plays but no audio**:  Check your device's volume and ensure that the `muted` prop is not set to `true`.
*   **HLS streams not working**:  Ensure that the HLS manifest file is correctly formatted and that your server is properly serving the stream.
*   **Android issues with specific video formats**: Some Android devices might have limited support for certain video codecs. Consider encoding your videos in a widely supported format like H.264.
*   **'java.lang.IllegalStateException: SurfaceTexture is not attached to an OpenGL ES context' Error on Android:** This can sometimes be solved by setting the `mixWithOthers` prop to true on your video component like this `<Video mixWithOthers={true} ...restProps/>`.
