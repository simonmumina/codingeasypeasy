# MySQL YEARWEEK() Function: Mastering Date Calculations for Reporting & Analytics

The `YEARWEEK()` function in MySQL is a powerful tool for extracting year and week number information from date values. This function is incredibly useful for generating reports, performing data analysis, and grouping data based on weekly periods.  Understanding how to effectively use `YEARWEEK()` can significantly improve your SQL queries and provide valuable insights from your data.

## Understanding the YEARWEEK() Function

The `YEARWEEK()` function returns the year and week for a given date.  The function takes one date argument and optionally a *mode* argument. The syntax is:

```sql
YEARWEEK(date[,mode]);
```

*   **date:**  This is the date or datetime value from which you want to extract the year and week.
*   **mode (optional):** This argument controls the week numbering system.  If omitted, the default mode is `0`. Understanding different modes is crucial for accurate week calculations, especially when dealing with weeks that span across different years.

## YEARWEEK() Modes: Choosing the Right Week Numbering

The `mode` argument dictates how the `YEARWEEK()` function calculates the week number. MySQL offers several modes, each affecting how the first week of the year is determined. Here's a breakdown of the most common modes:

| Mode | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | First Day of Week | Minimum Days in First Week |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| `0`  | Week starts on Sunday, week 1 is the first week with a Sunday in the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Sunday            | 1                          |
| `1`  | Week starts on Monday, week 1 is the first week with 4 or more days in the year.  ISO 8601 standard.  This is generally the most reliable for consistent week numbering across different systems.                                                                                                                | Monday            | 4                          |
| `2`  | Week starts on Sunday, week 1 is the first week with 4 or more days in the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Sunday            | 4                          |
| `3`  | Week starts on Monday, week 1 is the first week with a Monday in the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Monday            | 1                          |
| `4`  | Week starts on Sunday, week 1 is the first week with a Sunday in the year,  Year is from date, Week from 1-53, ISO-8601.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Sunday            | 4                          |
| `5`  | Week starts on Monday, week 1 is the first week with a Monday in the year,  Year is from date, Week from 1-53, ISO-8601.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Monday            | 4                          |
| `6`  | Week starts on Sunday, week 1 is the first week with a Sunday in the year.  Year is from date, Week from 1-53, ISO-8601, but with the Sunday starting.                                                                                                                                                                      | Sunday            | 4                          |
| `7`  | Week starts on Monday, week 1 is the first week with a Monday in the year.  Year is from date, Week from 1-53, ISO-8601, but with the Monday starting.                                                                                                                                                                      | Monday            | 4                          |

**Important Considerations for Choosing a Mode:**

*   **Consistency:** Select a mode that aligns with the week numbering convention you need to follow. The ISO 8601 standard (`mode 1`) is often a good choice for general-purpose reporting, as it ensures consistent week numbering across different systems.
*   **Business Requirements:**  Your company or organization might have specific requirements for how weeks are defined (e.g., starting day, minimum days in the first week).  Choose the mode that best meets these needs.
*   **Year Boundaries:** Be mindful of how weeks that span across year boundaries are handled. Some modes might assign the week to the previous year if most of the week falls within that year.

## Basic Usage Examples

Let's start with some simple examples to illustrate how `YEARWEEK()` works.

```sql
SELECT YEARWEEK('2024-02-29'); -- Output: 202409 (Default mode 0)

SELECT YEARWEEK('2024-02-29', 1); -- Output: 202409 (ISO 8601 mode)

SELECT YEARWEEK('2023-12-31', 1); -- Output: 202352 (ISO 8601 mode correctly identifies the last week of 2023)

SELECT YEARWEEK('2024-01-01', 1); -- Output: 202401 (ISO 8601 mode correctly identifies the first week of 2024)
```

In these examples, `YEARWEEK()` returns a single integer value combining the year and the week number.

## Practical Applications: Reporting and Analytics

The real power of `YEARWEEK()` lies in its ability to facilitate more complex reporting and analytics tasks.  Here are some common use cases:

**1. Grouping Data by Week:**

Imagine you have a table called `sales` with a `sale_date` column and a `sales_amount` column. You can use `YEARWEEK()` to group sales data by week and calculate the total sales amount for each week.

```sql
SELECT
    YEARWEEK(sale_date, 1) AS sale_week,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY
    sale_week
ORDER BY
    sale_week;
```

This query will return a result set where each row represents a specific week (year + week number) and the corresponding total sales amount for that week.  The `ORDER BY` clause ensures that the results are sorted chronologically.  Using `mode 1` (ISO 8601) ensures consistent week numbering.

**2. Filtering Data by Week:**

You can use `YEARWEEK()` in the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on a specific week.

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    sales
WHERE
    YEARWEEK(sale_date, 1) = YEARWEEK('2024-02-15', 1);
```

This query will return all sales records that occurred during the same week as February 15, 2024, using the ISO 8601 week numbering.

**3. Calculating Weekly Averages:**

Building on the grouping example, you can calculate the average sales amount per week over a specified period.

```sql
SELECT
    YEARWEEK(sale_date, 1) AS sale_week,
    AVG(sales_amount) AS average_sales
FROM
    sales
WHERE
    sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY
    sale_week
ORDER BY
    sale_week;
```

This query calculates the average sales amount for each week between January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024.

**4. Comparing Weekly Performance:**

You can use `YEARWEEK()` to compare the performance of different weeks or to track trends over time. For example, you might want to compare the sales amount for a specific week in the current year to the same week in the previous year.  This often involves using subqueries or self-joins.

**5. Integration with Reporting Tools:**

The output of `YEARWEEK()` can be easily integrated with various reporting tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio) to create visualizations and dashboards that display weekly trends and performance metrics.

## Advanced Usage and Considerations

*   **Performance:**  While `YEARWEEK()` is a useful function, applying it directly to a column in a `WHERE` clause can sometimes hinder performance, especially with large datasets.  Consider creating a derived column (e.g., using a generated column in MySQL 5.7+) or an index on `YEARWEEK(sale_date, 1)` to improve query performance.

*   **Date/Datetime Conversion:** Ensure that the input to `YEARWEEK()` is a valid date or datetime value. If your data is stored in a different format, use functions like `STR_TO_DATE()` to convert it to a compatible format.

*   **Time Zones:**  Be aware of time zone considerations, especially when dealing with data from multiple locations.  The `CONVERT_TZ()` function can be used to convert date/time values to a consistent time zone before applying `YEARWEEK()`.

*   **Combining with Other Date Functions:**  `YEARWEEK()` can be combined with other date functions like `DAYOFWEEK()`, `MONTH()`, and `QUARTER()` to perform even more complex date-based calculations and analysis.

## Example: Sales Data Analysis with YEARWEEK()

Let's consider a more comprehensive example.  Suppose you have a `sales` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO sales (sale_date, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES
('2024-02-20', 101, 2, 25.00),
('2024-02-22', 102, 1, 50.00),
('2024-02-27', 101, 3, 25.00),
('2024-03-01', 103, 1, 75.00),
('2024-03-05', 102, 2, 50.00),
('2024-03-08', 101, 1, 25.00),
('2023-12-28', 104, 4, 10.00),
('2024-01-02', 105, 2, 30.00);

```

Now, let's analyze the sales data to find the total revenue generated per week, using the ISO 8601 week numbering.

```sql
SELECT
    YEARWEEK(sale_date, 1) AS sale_week,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY
    sale_week
ORDER BY
    sale_week;
```

This query will output the total revenue for each week in the `sales` table, allowing you to track weekly sales performance.

## Conclusion

The `YEARWEEK()` function in MySQL is a valuable tool for manipulating and analyzing date data.  By understanding the different modes and applying `YEARWEEK()` creatively, you can generate insightful reports, track trends over time, and gain a deeper understanding of your data.  Remember to choose the appropriate `mode` argument based on your specific requirements and to optimize your queries for performance when working with large datasets.
