# Django 5.0: What's New and How to Use the Latest Features (with Code Examples)

Django, the popular Python web framework, has released its latest version: Django 5.0! This release brings a host of exciting new features and improvements designed to streamline development, enhance performance, and provide a more modern development experience. This article will delve into the key features of Django 5.0, providing detailed explanations and code examples to help you understand and utilize them effectively.

## Key New Features in Django 5.0

Django 5.0 is packed with updates, but here are the most significant ones:

- **Database Computed Columns:** This allows defining model fields whose values are automatically calculated by the database.
- **Field Groups in Forms:** Streamlines the organization of forms and enhances user experience.
- **Simplified Template Rendering with `{% render %}` Tag:** Provides a more concise and efficient way to render templates.
- **`ASGIHandler` Support for Middleware:** Improved ASGI compatibility for asynchronous handling.
- **Password Validation Improvements:** Enhanced security through more robust password validation.

Let's explore each of these features in more detail.

## 1. Database Computed Columns

One of the most significant additions in Django 5.0 is support for database computed columns. These columns are defined in your model but their values are calculated and stored directly by the database. This can improve performance by offloading calculations from your application server to the database server.

**Why are computed columns useful?**

- **Performance:** Calculations are performed at the database level, reducing the load on your application server.
- **Consistency:** Data is consistent across your application because the calculation is performed once at the database level.
- **Simplified Application Logic:** You don't need to recalculate the value every time you need it.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a `Product` model with `price` and `discount` fields. You want to calculate the `final_price` after the discount.

```plaintext
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, ExpressionWrapper, fields

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    discount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    final_price = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=10,
        decimal_places=2,
        editable=False, # Prevent editing from admin
        db_computed=True,
    )

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            models.CheckConstraint(
                check=F("price") >= 0,
                name="price_positive",
            ),
            models.CheckConstraint(
                check=F("discount") >= 0,
                name="discount_positive",
            ),
        ]

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    @classmethod
    def from_db(cls, db, field_names, values):
        instance = super().from_db(db, field_names, values)
        # Prevent saving the computed field via save() by unsetting its value
        setattr(instance, 'final_price', None)
        return instance
```

Now, the `final_price` column will be automatically calculated by the database whenever a `Product` is created or updated. You can access `product.final_price` in your views and templates just like any other model field. Django creates SQL like:

```plaintext
-- Example for PostgreSQL, other databases have similar syntax
CREATE TABLE product (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    discount DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0,
    final_price DECIMAL(10, 2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (price - (price * discount)) STORED
);
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Database Support:** Computed columns are database-specific. Django automatically generates the appropriate SQL for your chosen database backend. Make sure your database supports computed columns.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensure your computed column calculations are deterministic to avoid unexpected results. Avoid relying on external data that might change.
- **Mutability:** Computed columns are read-only. You cannot directly modify them through your application. Update the underlying fields instead.
- **`from_db` override:** The `from_db` method is overridden to prevent accidental saving of computed values via a `save()` call, as the database automatically manages them. Attempting to save to the database will do nothing, but will also not cause an error.

## 2. Field Groups in Forms

Django 5.0 introduces field groups, which offer a cleaner and more structured way to organize fields within your forms. This is especially beneficial for complex forms with many fields.

**Why use Field Groups?**

- **Improved Organization:** Group related fields together for better visual organization.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Logical grouping makes forms easier to understand and fill out.
- **Customization:** Customize the rendering of field groups to match your design.

**Example:**

Let's create a simple form for a user profile with address information grouped together.

```plaintext
from django import forms

class UserProfileForm(forms.Form):
    first_name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, label="First Name")
    last_name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, label="Last Name")
    email = forms.EmailField(label="Email")

    address_line_1 = forms.CharField(max_length=200, label="Address Line 1")
    address_line_2 = forms.CharField(max_length=200, label="Address Line 2", required=False)
    city = forms.CharField(max_length=100, label="City")
    state = forms.CharField(max_length=100, label="State")
    zip_code = forms.CharField(max_length=10, label="Zip Code")

    field_groups = {
        "personal_info": ["first_name", "last_name", "email"],
        "address": ["address_line_1", "address_line_2", "city", "state", "zip_code"],
    }
```

In your template, you can now iterate through the field groups:

```plaintext+django
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    {% for field in form.field_groups.personal_info %}
        <div class="form-group">
            {{ field.label_tag }}
            {{ field }}
            {% if field.errors %}
                <div class="error">{{ field.errors|striptags }}</div>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}

    <h2>Address</h2>
    {% for field in form.field_groups.address %}
        <div class="form-group">
            {{ field.label_tag }}
            {{ field }}
            {% if field.errors %}
                <div class="error">{{ field.errors|striptags }}</div>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

This example creates two distinct sections in your form, clearly separating personal information from address details. You can customize the HTML structure and styling as needed.

**Customizing Field Group Rendering:**

You can also create custom template tags or filters to further customize how field groups are rendered, providing even more control over your form's appearance.

## 3. Simplified Template Rendering with the `{% render %}` Tag

Django 5.0 introduces the `{% render %}` template tag, offering a simpler and more intuitive way to render templates within other templates. This simplifies complex template structures and promotes code reusability.

**Why use the `{% render %}` tag?**

- **Conciseness:** Reduces boilerplate code compared to using `{% include %}` with context.
- **Clarity:** Makes template rendering more explicit and easier to understand.
- **Context Management:** Handles context automatically, reducing the need for manual context passing.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a template called `user_profile.html`:

```plaintext+django
<div class="user-profile">
    <h1>{{ user.username }}</h1>
    <p>Email: {{ user.email }}</p>
    {% if user.bio %}
        <p>Bio: {{ user.bio }}</p>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

Now, let's use the `{% render %}` tag in another template to render this `user_profile.html` template:

```plaintext+django
{% load render %}

<div class="container">
    <h2>User Details</h2>
    {% render "user_profile.html" with user=current_user %}
</div>
```

The `{% render "user_profile.html" with user=current_user %}` tag will render the `user_profile.html` template using the `current_user` variable passed from the current context. No need to create a custom context dictionary!

**Benefits over `{% include %}`:**

While `{% include %}` is still valid, `{% render %}` handles context more elegantly. `{% include %}` implicitly includes the current context, which can sometimes lead to unintended variable collisions. `{% render %}` requires you to explicitly pass the context you want to use, making it more predictable and less prone to errors.

## 4. `ASGIHandler` Support for Middleware

Django has been gradually embracing asynchronous views and middleware to improve performance and scalability. Django 5.0 further enhances ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) support by allowing ASGI middleware to be used with the `ASGIHandler`.

**What does this mean?**

- **Asynchronous Middleware:** You can now create middleware that handles requests asynchronously, allowing you to perform non-blocking operations and improve the responsiveness of your application.
- **Improved Performance:** ASGI allows for concurrent request handling, leading to better overall performance.

**Example:**

Here's an example of an asynchronous middleware:

```plaintext
from django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin
import asyncio

class AsyncExampleMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin):
    async def process_request(self, request):
        # Perform asynchronous operations here
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate a non-blocking operation
        print("Async middleware processing request")
        return None

    async def process_response(self, request, response):
        # Process the response asynchronously
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        print("Async middleware processing response")
        return response
```

Remember to add this middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting in `settings.py`. This enables you to leverage asynchronous operations within your middleware, improving your application's efficiency.

**Configuration:**

Ensure your Django project is configured to use an ASGI server like `uvicorn` or `daphne` for optimal performance.

## 5. Password Validation Improvements

Security is paramount, and Django 5.0 enhances password validation to further protect your users' accounts.

**Improvements:**

- **More Granular Control:** Provides finer-grained control over password requirements.
- **Customizable Validation Rules:** Easily define custom password validation rules to meet specific security needs.
- **Improved Error Messages:** More informative error messages to guide users in creating strong passwords.

**Example:**

You can configure your password validation settings in `settings.py`:

```plaintext
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'user_attributes': ('username', 'email', 'first_name', 'last_name'),
            'max_similarity': 0.7,
        },
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'min_length': 12,
        },
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator',
    },
    {
        'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator',
    },
]
```

This configuration sets several password validation rules:

- `UserAttributeSimilarityValidator`: Prevents passwords that are too similar to user attributes.
- `MinimumLengthValidator`: Requires passwords to be at least 12 characters long.
- `CommonPasswordValidator`: Prevents the use of commonly used passwords.
- `NumericPasswordValidator`: Requires passwords to contain at least one number.

You can easily create your own custom password validators to enforce specific requirements tailored to your application.
