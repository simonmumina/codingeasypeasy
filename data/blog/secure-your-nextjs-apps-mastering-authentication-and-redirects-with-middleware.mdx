# Secure Your Next.js Apps: Mastering Authentication and Redirects with Middleware

Next.js middleware is a powerful feature that allows you to intercept and modify requests before they reach your routes. This makes it an ideal solution for implementing authentication, handling redirects, and performing other request-based logic in a central, efficient, and performant way. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of using Next.js middleware for authentication and redirects, providing practical examples and best practices.

## What is Next.js Middleware?

Middleware in Next.js allows you to run code before a request is completed. It lives between the incoming request and your applicationâ€™s routes, acting as a gatekeeper or interceptor. This means you can examine the request, make decisions based on its properties (like cookies, headers, or URL), and then:

- **Modify the request:** Change the request headers or URL.
- **Redirect the request:** Send the user to a different page.
- **Return a response:** Send a custom response directly, bypassing the route handler.
- **Continue the request:** Allow the request to proceed to the appropriate route handler.

## Why Use Middleware for Authentication and Redirects?

Using middleware for authentication and redirects offers several advantages:

- **Centralized Logic:** Keep your authentication and redirect logic in one place, making it easier to maintain and update.
- **Improved Performance:** Middleware runs at the edge, often closer to the user, leading to faster response times and improved performance.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement robust authentication checks before any route logic is executed, protecting your application from unauthorized access.
- **Cleaner Code:** Reduce code duplication by handling authentication and redirects in middleware instead of within individual page components.

## Setting Up Your Middleware

1.  **Create the `middleware.ts` (or `middleware.js`) file:**

    In your `src` directory (or your project root if you don't have a `src` directory), create a file named `middleware.ts` or `middleware.js`. Next.js automatically recognizes this file and executes the code within it for every route in your application (or specific routes if you configure it).

2.  **Define Your Middleware Function:**

    The `middleware.ts` file should export a default function named `middleware`:

    ```plaintext
    // middleware.ts
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
    import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

    export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
      // Your middleware logic goes here
      console.log('Middleware is running!')
      return NextResponse.next() // Allows the request to continue
    }

    // See the "Matching Paths" section below to learn how to target specific paths
    export const config = {
      matcher: [
        /*
         * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
         * - _next/static (static files)
         * - _next/image (image optimization files)
         * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
         * - public folder
         */
        '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$).*)',
      ],
    }
    ```

    - **`NextRequest`**: Represents the incoming request. It contains information about the request's URL, headers, cookies, and more.
    - **`NextResponse`**: Allows you to modify the response. You can use `NextResponse.next()` to continue the request to the route handler, `NextResponse.redirect()` to redirect the user, or `NextResponse.rewrite()` to rewrite the request to a different route internally.
    - **`config.matcher`**: This is an essential part. It allows you to specify which paths your middleware should run for. Without a `matcher`, the middleware will run for _every_ request, which can impact performance.

## Authentication with Middleware: A Practical Example

Let's create a simple example of using middleware for authentication. We'll assume you have an authentication token stored in a cookie called `authToken`.

```plaintext
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

const protectedRoutes = ['/profile', '/dashboard'] // Routes that require authentication
const publicRoutes = ['/login', '/register'] // Routes that are accessible without authentication

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const authToken = request.cookies.get('authToken')?.value
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname

  const isProtectedRoute = protectedRoutes.includes(pathname)
  const isPublicRoute = publicRoutes.includes(pathname)

  // 1. If user is authenticated and trying to access public routes, redirect to dashboard
  if (authToken && isPublicRoute) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url))
  }

  // 2. If user is not authenticated and trying to access protected routes, redirect to login
  if (!authToken && isProtectedRoute) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(`/login?redirect=${pathname}`, request.url)) // Pass the original path as a query parameter
  }

  // 3.  If user is authenticated and trying to access a route that doesn't exist redirect to homepage
  if (
    authToken &&
    !protectedRoutes.includes(pathname) &&
    !publicRoutes.includes(pathname) &&
    pathname !== '/'
  ) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url))
  }

  // Allow request to continue.
  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     */
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif)$).*)',
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`protectedRoutes` and `publicRoutes`:** Arrays defining which routes require authentication and which are publicly accessible. Adjust these lists to match your application's structure.
2.  **`authToken`:** Retrieves the value of the `authToken` cookie. If the cookie is not present, `authToken` will be `undefined`.
3.  **`pathname`:** Gets the current path of the request.
4.  **`isProtectedRoute` and `isPublicRoute`**: Boolean values which determine if the route is protected or public, respectively.
5.  **Redirection Logic:**

    - If a user is authenticated (has an `authToken`) and tries to access a public route (e.g., `/login`), they are redirected to the `/dashboard`.
    - If a user is _not_ authenticated and tries to access a protected route (e.g., `/profile`), they are redirected to the `/login` page. The original path (`pathname`) is passed as a query parameter (`redirect`) so that after successful login, the user can be redirected back to the originally requested protected page.

6.  **`NextResponse.next()`:** If none of the redirection conditions are met, the request is allowed to proceed to the intended route.

**Implementing a Login Page to use the redirect parameter:**

```plaintext
// pages/login.tsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function LoginPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { redirect } = router.query; // get the redirect query param
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    // Replace with your actual authentication logic (e.g., API call)
    const success = await simulateLogin(username, password); // Simulate successful login

    if (success) {
      // Set the authentication token in a cookie
      document.cookie = "authToken=your_jwt_token; path=/"; // Replace your_jwt_token with a real token

      // Redirect to the originally requested page or the dashboard
      router.push(redirect ? redirect as string : '/dashboard');
    } else {
      alert('Invalid username or password'); // Handle login failure
    }
  };

  // Dummy login function for demonstration
  const simulateLogin = async (username, password) => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (username === 'user' && password === 'password') {
          resolve(true);
        } else {
          resolve(false);
        }
      }, 500); // Simulate API delay
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Username:
          <input type="text" value={username} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} />
        </label>
        <br />
        <label>
          Password:
          <input type="password" value={password} onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} />
        </label>
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens):** In a real-world application, you would likely use JWTs for authentication. Your login endpoint would generate a JWT upon successful login and store it in a cookie (ideally an `httpOnly` cookie for enhanced security). The middleware would then verify the JWT's signature to authenticate the user.
- **`httpOnly` Cookies:** Always use `httpOnly` cookies to store sensitive data like JWTs. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating the risk of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. You typically set `httpOnly` cookies on the server-side (in your API routes).
- **Refresh Tokens:** For longer-lasting sessions, consider using refresh tokens. This involves issuing a short-lived JWT along with a longer-lived refresh token. When the JWT expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new JWT.
- **Secure Cookies:** Use the `secure` attribute when setting cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS connections.

## Redirects with Middleware

Middleware is also excellent for handling redirects based on various conditions, such as:

- **Language Preferences:** Redirect users to their preferred language version of your site.
- **A/B Testing:** Randomly redirect users to different versions of a page for A/B testing.
- **Geo-Based Redirects:** Redirect users based on their geographic location.
- **Maintenance Mode:** Redirect all traffic to a maintenance page during site maintenance.

**Example: Language-Based Redirects**

```plaintext
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

const supportedLanguages = ['en', 'fr', 'es']
const defaultLanguage = 'en'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname

  // Check if the pathname already includes a language prefix
  const pathnameHasLocale = supportedLanguages.some(
    (locale) => pathname.startsWith(`/${locale}/`) || pathname === `/${locale}`
  )

  if (pathnameHasLocale) return NextResponse.next()

  // Get the user's preferred language from the 'Accept-Language' header
  const preferredLanguage =
    request.headers.get('accept-language')?.split(',')[0]?.substring(0, 2) || defaultLanguage

  // Redirect to the user's preferred language if it's supported
  if (supportedLanguages.includes(preferredLanguage)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(`/${preferredLanguage}${pathname}`, request.url))
  }

  // If the preferred language is not supported, redirect to the default language
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(`/${defaultLanguage}${pathname}`, request.url))
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     */
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|api|_vercel|[a-z]{2}).*)',
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`supportedLanguages` and `defaultLanguage`:** Defines the supported languages and the default language.
2.  **`pathnameHasLocale`:** Checks if the current path already has a language prefix. This prevents infinite redirect loops.
3.  **`preferredLanguage`:** Extracts the user's preferred language from the `Accept-Language` header.
4.  **Redirection Logic:**

    - If the user's preferred language is supported, they are redirected to the appropriate language version of the page.
    - If the preferred language is not supported, they are redirected to the default language.

**Important Considerations:**

- **`Accept-Language` Header:** The `Accept-Language` header is sent by the browser and indicates the user's preferred languages.
- **SEO:** When implementing language-based redirects, be sure to use the `hreflang` attribute in your HTML to inform search engines about the different language versions of your pages.
- **Infinite Loops:** Be extremely careful to avoid infinite redirect loops. Always check if the request has already been redirected before attempting another redirect.

## Advanced Middleware Techniques

- **Rewriting Requests:** Use `NextResponse.rewrite()` to rewrite the request to a different route internally without changing the URL in the browser's address bar. This can be useful for implementing features like dynamic routing or URL masking.

  ```plaintext
  // Example: Rewriting requests to /blog/:slug to /posts/:slug
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
  import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

  export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
    const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname

    if (pathname.startsWith('/blog/')) {
      const slug = pathname.substring('/blog/'.length)
      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(`/posts/${slug}`, request.url))
    }

    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  export const config = {
    matcher: '/blog/:slug*',
  }
  ```

- **Using the `cookies` Object:** Access and modify cookies using the `request.cookies` object. You can `get`, `set`, and `delete` cookies.

  ```plaintext
  // Setting a cookie
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
  import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

  export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
    const response = NextResponse.next()
    response.cookies.set('myCookie', 'cookieValue', { httpOnly: true, secure: true }) // Example: set httpOnly and secure
    return response
  }

  export const config = {
    matcher: '/',
  }
  ```

  ```plaintext
  // Getting a cookie
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
  import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

  export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
    const myCookie = request.cookies.get('myCookie')?.value
    console.log('Cookie Value:', myCookie)
    return NextResponse.next()
  }

  export const config = {
    matcher: '/',
  }
  ```

- **Edge Functions:** Next.js middleware runs at the edge (Vercel Edge Network or similar), which means it's executed closer to the user, leading to faster response times. However, keep in mind that edge functions have limitations on execution time and resources. If your middleware logic is very complex or resource-intensive, consider moving it to a serverless function.

## Debugging Middleware

Debugging middleware can sometimes be tricky. Here are some tips:

- **Console Logging:** Use `console.log()` to log the request URL, headers, cookies, and other relevant information.
- **`NextResponse.json()`:** Return a JSON response from your middleware to inspect the state of the request or response. This can be helpful for debugging redirect logic.
- **Check the `matcher` Configuration:** Make sure your `matcher` configuration is correct. If your middleware is not running as expected, double-check that the paths you're targeting are correct.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Middleware Logic Simple:** Middleware should be focused on authentication, redirects, and basic request modification. Avoid complex logic that can slow down request processing. If you have complex logic, consider moving it to a serverless function.
- **Use `httpOnly` Cookies for Sensitive Data:** Protect sensitive data like JWTs by storing them in `httpOnly` cookies.
- **Avoid Infinite Redirect Loops:** Carefully design your redirect logic to prevent infinite loops.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your middleware thoroughly to ensure it's working as expected in different scenarios.
- **Monitor Performance:** Monitor the performance of your middleware to identify any bottlenecks.
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, secret keys) in environment variables.

## Integrating with NextAuth.js

[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) is a popular authentication library for Next.js. While NextAuth.js provides its own session management and authentication mechanisms, you can still use middleware to enhance your authentication logic.

**Example:**

```plaintext
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { getToken } from 'next-auth/jwt' // Ensure this is installed: npm install next-auth

const secret = process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getToken({ req: request, secret })

  if (!session) {
    const signInUrl = new URL('/auth/signin', request.url)
    signInUrl.searchParams.append('callbackUrl', request.url)
    return NextResponse.redirect(signInUrl)
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - api (API routes)
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     * - login (login page)
     * - /auth/signin (NextAuth.js sign-in page)
     */
    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|auth/signin).*)',
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`getToken`:** Uses `next-auth/jwt` to securely verify the JWT token.
2.  **`session`**: Retrieves the user's session data from the JWT. If the user is not authenticated, `session` will be `null`.
3.  **Redirection Logic:** If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the sign-in page provided by NextAuth.js, passing the original URL as a `callbackUrl`.

**Important:**

- Install `next-auth`: `npm install next-auth`
- You must set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in your environment variables.
- Modify the `matcher` to include the `auth/signin` route, so NextAuth.js can correctly handle the login logic.

## Conclusion

Next.js middleware is a powerful tool for implementing authentication, redirects, and other request-based logic in your Next.js applications. By understanding the concepts and techniques discussed in this guide, you can create secure, efficient, and maintainable web applications. Remember to keep your middleware logic simple, test thoroughly, and monitor performance to ensure optimal results. Happy coding!
