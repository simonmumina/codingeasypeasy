# Connect SolidStart to Neon: A Comprehensive Guide for Serverless PostgreSQL

SolidStart is a promising meta-framework for building fast and reactive web applications with SolidJS. Neon is a serverless, autoscaling PostgreSQL database, offering a developer-friendly way to manage data in cloud-native environments. Combining these technologies allows you to build powerful, scalable, and cost-effective web applications. This guide walks you through connecting your SolidStart application to a Neon database.

## Why SolidStart and Neon?

- **SolidStart:** Offers a smooth developer experience with features like server-side rendering, file-based routing, and built-in support for serverless functions, all powered by the performance of SolidJS.
- **Neon:** Provides a serverless PostgreSQL database that automatically scales up or down based on your application's needs. This means you only pay for what you use and don't have to worry about database infrastructure management. Neon's branching and versioning features are also excellent for development workflows.
- **Scalability & Efficiency:** Neon is designed for serverless architectures, making it a perfect fit for SolidStart's serverless function capabilities.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go pricing model of Neon means you only pay for the resources you consume.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm):** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or later) and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your system.
- **SolidStart Project:** A working SolidStart project. If you don't have one, create a new project using the following command:

  ```plaintext
  npx degit solidjs/solid-start my-solidstart-app
  cd my-solidstart-app
  npm install # or yarn install or pnpm install
  ```

- **Neon Account:** A Neon account. Sign up for a free account at [https://neon.tech/](https://neon.tech/).
- **Neon Project and Database:** A Neon project and a database within that project. Follow Neon's documentation to create a project and database. Take note of your database connection string.

## Step 1: Setting up your Neon Database Connection

1.  **Obtain your Connection String:** After creating your Neon database, you'll need to obtain the connection string. This string contains all the information your application needs to connect to the database (host, port, user, password, database name). You can find it in the Neon console under the "Connection Details" section.

    The connection string will look something like this:

    ```
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?sslmode=require
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:** Store your Neon database connection string as an environment variable. This is crucial for security and configuration management. Create a `.env` file in the root of your SolidStart project and add the following line, replacing the placeholder with your actual connection string:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?sslmode=require"
    ```

    **Important:** Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing your sensitive credentials to your repository.

## Step 2: Choosing an ORM (or Raw SQL)

You have two main options for interacting with your Neon database:

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** ORMs provide a higher-level abstraction over raw SQL, making it easier to interact with your database using JavaScript objects and functions. Popular ORMs for PostgreSQL include Prisma, Drizzle ORM, and Sequelize.
- **Raw SQL:** You can directly execute SQL queries against your database using a PostgreSQL client library. This gives you more control but requires writing and managing SQL code.

For this guide, we'll use **Drizzle ORM**. Drizzle is a lightweight, TypeScript-first ORM that's well-suited for serverless environments due to its low overhead.

## Step 3: Installing Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL Client

Install the necessary packages using npm (or yarn/pnpm):

```plaintext
npm install drizzle-orm @neondatabase/serverless drizzle-kit pg
# or
yarn add drizzle-orm @neondatabase/serverless drizzle-kit pg
# or
pnpm add drizzle-orm @neondatabase/serverless drizzle-kit pg
```

- `drizzle-orm`: The core Drizzle ORM library.
- `@neondatabase/serverless`: The Neon-specific PostgreSQL driver optimized for serverless environments. **Using this driver is highly recommended for Neon's performance characteristics.**
- `drizzle-kit`: A CLI tool for generating migrations and performing database schema management.
- `pg`: A pure javascript PostgreSQL client for node.js. This is required by Drizzle, but we use `@neondatabase/serverless` directly for connections.

## Step 4: Defining Your Database Schema with Drizzle

Create a `schema.ts` file in a directory like `src/db` (you'll need to create the `db` directory):

```typescript
// src/db/schema.ts
import { pgTable, serial, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
})

export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect // return type when queried
export type NewUser = typeof users.$inferInsert // insert type
```

This example defines a simple `users` table with columns for `id`, `name`, `email`, and `createdAt`. The `users.$inferSelect` and `users.$inferInsert` types are very useful for type safety in your application.

## Step 5: Setting up the Drizzle Client

Create a database client instance in `src/db/index.ts`:

```typescript
// src/db/index.ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js'
import { neonConfig, Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless'
import { migrate } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres/migrator'
import * as schema from './schema'

neonConfig.fetchConnectionCache = true

const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL!

const pool = new Pool({ connectionString })

export const db = drizzle(pool, { schema })

async function runMigrate() {
  console.log('running migrations')
  await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: './drizzle' })
  console.log('migrations finished')
  process.exit(0)
}

if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) {
  runMigrate()
}

export * from './schema'
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `@neondatabase/serverless` library and configure it.
- We retrieve the database connection string from the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. **Ensure this variable is defined in your environment before running your SolidStart application.**
- We create a `db` instance using `drizzle`, passing in the Neon connection and the schema we defined in `schema.ts`.
- We export the database schema as well for ease of use.
- We use a `Pool` to manage database connections effectively.
- The `runMigrate()` function handles database migrations.
- We can run the file with node to trigger the migrations (see next step).

## Step 6: Generating and Running Database Migrations

Drizzle Kit simplifies database schema management using migrations.

1.  **Initialize Drizzle Kit:**

    ```plaintext
    npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
    ```

    This command will generate a `drizzle.config.ts` file in your project root. Customize it to point to your database connection and schema file:

    ```typescript
    // drizzle.config.ts
    import type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit'
    import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
    dotenv.config()

    export default {
      schema: './src/db/schema.ts',
      out: './drizzle',
      driver: 'pg',
      dbCredentials: {
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL || '',
      },
      verbose: true,
      strict: true,
    } satisfies Config
    ```

2.  **Generate Migrations:** Run the following command to generate a migration file based on your schema:

    ```plaintext
    npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
    ```

    This will create a new migration file in the `./drizzle` directory.

3.  **Apply Migrations:** Run the `runMigrate` function defined in `src/db/index.ts` by directly running the file with node.

    ```plaintext
    node src/db/index.ts
    ```

    This will apply the migration to your Neon database, creating the `users` table (and any other tables you've defined in your schema). If you encounter issues with migrations, double-check that your `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set and accessible.

## Step 7: Using the Database in your SolidStart Application

Now, you can use the `db` client in your SolidStart components or server routes to interact with your Neon database.

**Example: Fetching Users in a Server Route**

Create a server route file, for example, `src/routes/api/users.ts`:

```typescript
// src/routes/api/users.ts
import { db, users } from '~/db'
import { APIEvent } from 'solid-start/api'
import { json } from 'solid-start/server'

export async function GET(event: APIEvent) {
  const allUsers = await db.select().from(users)
  return json(allUsers)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `db` client and the `users` table definition from `src/db/index.ts`.
- We define a `GET` handler for the `/api/users` route.
- Inside the handler, we use `db.select().from(users)` to query all users from the database.
- We return the results as a JSON response using `json()`.

**Example: Displaying Users in a SolidStart Component**

In a SolidStart component (e.g., `src/routes/index.tsx`):

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import { createResource } from 'solid-js'
import { A, Head, Meta, Routes, Body } from 'solid-start'
import { RouteDataFunc, useRouteData } from 'solid-start/route-data'

type User = {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  createdAt: string
}

export const routeData: RouteDataFunc<User[]> = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/users')
  return await res.json()
}

export default function Home() {
  const data = useRouteData<User[]>()

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <Title>SolidStart + Neon</Title>
        <Meta name="description" content="SolidStart + Neon Demo" />
      </Head>

      <Body>
        <h1>Users</h1>
        <ul>
          {data()?.map((user) => (
            <li key={user.id}>
              {user.name} ({user.email})
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </Body>
    </>
  )
}

function Title(props: { children: string }) {
  return <title>{props.children}</title>
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We define a `routeData` function that fetches the users from the `/api/users` endpoint (the server route we created earlier).
- We use `createResource` to fetch data and automatically re-render when data changes.
- We render a list of users, displaying their names and email addresses.

## Step 8: Deploying to a Serverless Environment

SolidStart is designed to work well with serverless environments like Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare Pages. Follow the SolidStart documentation and your chosen platform's deployment guide to deploy your application.

**Important Considerations for Serverless Deployment:**

- **Environment Variables:** Ensure that your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is properly configured in your serverless environment. Many platforms provide a way to set environment variables during deployment.
- **Connection Pooling:** Neon's serverless architecture benefits from connection pooling. The `@neondatabase/serverless` driver and the `Pool` object provide built-in connection pooling, optimizing performance.
- **Cold Starts:** Be aware of potential cold start issues in serverless environments. Cold starts can introduce latency during the first request to your database. Consider strategies to mitigate cold starts, such as keeping your serverless functions warm.
