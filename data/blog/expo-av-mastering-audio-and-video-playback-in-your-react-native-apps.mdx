# Expo AV: Mastering Audio and Video Playback in Your React Native Apps

React Native developers often need to incorporate audio and video playback into their applications. Expo AV provides a powerful and convenient way to handle media in your Expo-based projects. This guide dives deep into Expo AV, covering everything from basic playback to advanced features, ensuring a smooth media experience for your users.

## What is Expo AV?

Expo AV is a set of JavaScript APIs that allow you to play audio and video within your React Native Expo applications. It simplifies media playback across different platforms (iOS and Android) by providing a consistent interface and handling platform-specific complexities. It leverages native media players under the hood, ensuring efficient performance and a native look and feel.

## Why Use Expo AV?

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Write your media playback logic once and run it on both iOS and Android. Expo AV handles the platform differences for you.
- **Simplified API:** Expo AV provides a high-level API that abstracts away the complexities of native media players. You can focus on your application logic instead of platform-specific details.
- **Expo Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the Expo ecosystem, making it easy to use with other Expo modules.
- **Rich Feature Set:** Supports a wide range of features, including playback control, volume adjustment, muting, looping, audio recording, and more.
- **Community Support:** Benefit from the active Expo community and extensive documentation.

## Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Before you can start using Expo AV, you need to install it in your Expo project. Run the following command in your project's root directory:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-av
```

This command installs the `expo-av` package and automatically links it to your project. No manual linking is required.

## Basic Audio Playback

Let's start with a simple example of playing an audio file.

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { Audio } from 'expo-av'

export default function App() {
  const [sound, setSound] = useState()

  async function playSound() {
    console.log('Loading Sound')
    const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(
      require('./assets/sample_audio.mp3') // Replace with your audio file
    )
    setSound(sound)

    console.log('Playing Sound')
    await sound.playAsync()
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    return sound
      ? () => {
          console.log('Unloading Sound')
          sound.unloadAsync()
        }
      : undefined
  }, [sound])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Play Sound" onPress={playSound} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary modules:** We import `Audio` from `expo-av` and other necessary React Native components.
2. **`useState` hook:** We use the `useState` hook to manage the `sound` object, which will hold the loaded audio file.
3. **`playSound` function:**
   - This asynchronous function is responsible for loading and playing the audio.
   - `Audio.Sound.createAsync()` loads the audio file. Replace `'./assets/sample_audio.mp3'` with the actual path to your audio file. You can use local files or remote URLs.
   - `sound.playAsync()` starts playing the audio.
4. **`useEffect` hook:**
   - This hook is used for cleanup. When the component unmounts, or when the `sound` object changes, we unload the audio file using `sound.unloadAsync()`. This is important for releasing resources and preventing memory leaks.
5. **Button component:** A simple button that, when pressed, calls the `playSound` function.

**Important Notes:**

- Make sure you have an audio file (e.g., `sample_audio.mp3`) in your `assets` directory (or any other appropriate location).
- You'll need to request audio permissions if you're recording audio. We will cover that later.

## Basic Video Playback

Playing video is very similar to playing audio.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { View, StyleSheet, Dimensions } from 'react-native'
import { Video } from 'expo-av'

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window')

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Video
        source={{ uri: 'http://d23dyxeqlo5psv.cloudfront.net/big_buck_bunny.mp4' }} // Replace with your video URL or local path
        style={styles.video}
        useNativeControls
        resizeMode="contain"
        isLooping
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#000',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  video: {
    width: width,
    height: height / 2,
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import the `Video` component:** We import the `Video` component from `expo-av`.
2. **`source` prop:** This prop specifies the video source. It can be a URL or a local file path. In this example, we're using a sample video URL.
3. **`style` prop:** Defines the dimensions of the video player. Adjust the width and height as needed.
4. **`useNativeControls` prop:** This boolean prop (set to `true` in this example) enables native video player controls (play/pause, volume, fullscreen, etc.). If set to `false`, you'll need to implement your own custom controls.
5. **`resizeMode` prop:** Determines how the video is resized to fit the container. Possible values include:
   - `"contain"`: Maintains the video's aspect ratio and fits it within the container, potentially leaving empty space.
   - `"cover"`: Maintains the video's aspect ratio and fills the container, potentially cropping the video.
   - `"stretch"`: Stretches the video to fill the container, potentially distorting the video's aspect ratio.
6. **`isLooping` prop:** A boolean prop that determines whether the video should loop when it reaches the end.

## Advanced Features

Expo AV provides many advanced features to enhance your audio and video playback experience.

### Playback Status

You can get the current playback status of the audio or video using the `getStatusAsync()` method. This returns a promise that resolves with an object containing information about the current state, such as:

- `isPlaying`: A boolean indicating whether the audio/video is currently playing.
- `positionMillis`: The current playback position in milliseconds.
- `durationMillis`: The total duration of the audio/video in milliseconds.
- `isLooping`: A boolean indicating whether the audio/video is looping.
- `volume`: The current volume level (a number between 0 and 1).
- `isMuted`: A boolean indicating whether the audio/video is muted.
- `rate`: The playback rate (1.0 is normal speed).
- `shouldPlay`: Whether the audio/video should start playing as soon as it's loaded (useful for autoplay).

Here's an example of how to use `getStatusAsync()`:

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { Audio } from 'expo-av'

export default function App() {
  const [sound, setSound] = useState()
  const [status, setStatus] = useState({})

  async function playSound() {
    const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(require('./assets/sample_audio.mp3'))
    setSound(sound)

    await sound.playAsync()
  }

  async function getPlaybackStatus() {
    if (sound) {
      const status = await sound.getStatusAsync()
      setStatus(status)
      console.log(status)
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    return sound
      ? () => {
          console.log('Unloading Sound')
          sound.unloadAsync()
        }
      : undefined
  }, [sound])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Play Sound" onPress={playSound} />
      <Button title="Get Status" onPress={getPlaybackStatus} />
      <Text>Playing: {status.isPlaying ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
      <Text>Position: {status.positionMillis} ms</Text>
      <Text>Duration: {status.durationMillis} ms</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    padding: 20,
  },
})
```

### Playback Control: Play, Pause, Stop, Seek

Expo AV provides methods for controlling playback:

- `playAsync()`: Starts or resumes playback.
- `pauseAsync()`: Pauses playback.
- `stopAsync()`: Stops playback and resets the position to the beginning.
- `setPositionAsync(millis)`: Seeks to a specific position in milliseconds.
- `setRateAsync(rate, shouldCorrectPitch)`: Sets the playback rate. `rate` is a number, and `shouldCorrectPitch` is a boolean that determines whether the pitch should be adjusted to match the rate (e.g., keeping the pitch the same when playing at 2x speed).

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { Audio } from 'expo-av'

export default function App() {
  const [sound, setSound] = useState()
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false)

  async function loadSound() {
    const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(require('./assets/sample_audio.mp3'))
    setSound(sound)
  }

  async function playPauseSound() {
    if (sound) {
      if (isPlaying) {
        await sound.pauseAsync()
      } else {
        await sound.playAsync()
      }
      setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)
    }
  }

  async function stopSound() {
    if (sound) {
      await sound.stopAsync()
      setIsPlaying(false)
    }
  }

  async function seekTo(positionMillis) {
    if (sound) {
      await sound.setPositionAsync(positionMillis)
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    loadSound() // Load the sound when the component mounts

    return sound
      ? () => {
          console.log('Unloading Sound')
          sound.unloadAsync()
        }
      : undefined
  }, [sound])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title={isPlaying ? 'Pause' : 'Play'} onPress={playPauseSound} />
      <Button title="Stop" onPress={stopSound} />
      <Button title="Seek to 5 seconds" onPress={() => seekTo(5000)} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
})
```

### Volume and Muting

You can adjust the volume and mute the audio using the following methods:

- `setVolumeAsync(volume)`: Sets the volume level, where `volume` is a number between 0 (muted) and 1 (maximum volume).
- `setMutedAsync(isMuted)`: Mutes or unmutes the audio, where `isMuted` is a boolean.

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button, Slider, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { Audio } from 'expo-av'

export default function App() {
  const [sound, setSound] = useState()
  const [volume, setVolume] = useState(1)

  async function loadSound() {
    const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(require('./assets/sample_audio.mp3'))
    setSound(sound)
    await sound.playAsync()
  }

  async function setSoundVolume(value) {
    setVolume(value)
    if (sound) {
      await sound.setVolumeAsync(value)
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    loadSound()

    return sound
      ? () => {
          console.log('Unloading Sound')
          sound.unloadAsync()
        }
      : undefined
  }, [sound])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Slider
        style={{ width: 200, height: 40 }}
        minimumValue={0}
        maximumValue={1}
        value={volume}
        onValueChange={(value) => setSoundVolume(value)}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
})
```

### Audio Recording

Expo AV also allows you to record audio.

1. **Request Permissions:** Before recording, you need to request audio recording permissions.

```plaintext
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions'

async function requestAudioPermissions() {
  const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.AUDIO_RECORDING)
  return status === 'granted'
}
```

2. **Create a Recording Object:** Create a new `Audio.Recording` object.

```plaintext
const recording = new Audio.Recording()
```

3. **Prepare the Recording:** Prepare the recording object with options like output format, sample rate, and number of channels.

```plaintext
await recording.prepareToRecordAsync(Audio.RECORDING_OPTIONS_PRESET_HIGH_QUALITY)
```

4. **Start and Stop Recording:** Start and stop the recording using `startAsync()` and `stopAndUnloadAsync()`.

```plaintext
await recording.startAsync()
await recording.stopAndUnloadAsync()
```

5. **Get the Recording URI:** Get the URI of the recorded audio file using `getURI()`.

```plaintext
const uri = recording.getURI()
console.log('Recording URI: ', uri)
```

Here's a complete example:

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Button, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import { Audio } from 'expo-av'
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions'

export default function App() {
  const [recording, setRecording] = useState(null)
  const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false)
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      const { status } = await Audio.requestPermissionsAsync()
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted')
    })()
  }, [])

  async function startRecording() {
    try {
      console.log('Requesting permissions..')
      await Audio.requestPermissionsAsync()
      await Audio.setAudioModeAsync({
        allowsRecordingIOS: true,
        playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
      })
      console.log('Starting recording..')
      const recording = new Audio.Recording()
      await recording.prepareToRecordAsync(Audio.RECORDING_OPTIONS_PRESET_HIGH_QUALITY)
      setRecording(recording)
      await recording.startAsync()
      setIsRecording(true)
      console.log('Recording started')
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Failed to start recording', err)
    }
  }

  async function stopRecording() {
    console.log('Stopping recording..')
    setIsRecording(false)
    await recording.stopAndUnloadAsync()
    const uri = recording.getURI()
    console.log('Recording stopped and stored at', uri)
  }

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to audio</Text>
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button
        title={isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'}
        onPress={isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
})
```

**Important Considerations for Audio Recording:**

- **Permissions:** Always request audio recording permissions from the user before attempting to record audio.
- **Audio Mode:** Setting the audio mode is crucial for controlling how the app interacts with the device's audio system. `allowsRecordingIOS` enables recording on iOS, and `playsInSilentModeIOS` allows the audio to play even when the device is in silent mode.
- **Recording Options:** Choose the appropriate recording options based on your application's needs. `Audio.RECORDING_OPTIONS_PRESET_HIGH_QUALITY` provides a good balance between audio quality and file size. Other options include `Audio.RECORDING_OPTIONS_PRESET_LOW_QUALITY` and custom settings for sample rate, bit rate, and codec.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during the recording process.
- **File Storage:** Consider where you want to store the recorded audio files. You can store them locally on the device or upload them to a remote server.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions you might encounter while using Expo AV:

- **Audio/Video Not Playing:**

  - **Check the file path or URL:** Ensure that the file path or URL is correct and accessible.
  - **Check the file format:** Expo AV supports common audio and video formats like MP3, MP4, AAC, and HLS. Make sure your file is in a supported format.
  - **Check permissions:** Make sure your app has the necessary permissions to access audio and video resources.
  - **Check device compatibility:** Some codecs or formats might not be supported on all devices.

- **No Sound:**

  - **Check the volume:** Make sure the volume is not muted or set to zero.
  - **Check audio focus:** Ensure your app has audio focus. Other apps might be interrupting the audio playback.
  - **Check device settings:** Make sure the device's volume is turned up and that it's not in silent mode.

- **Video Not Displaying:**

  - **Check the style:** Make sure the `Video` component has a valid width and height.
  - **Check the `resizeMode`:** Experiment with different `resizeMode` values to find the best fit for your video.
  - **Check the video codec:** Ensure the video codec is supported on the target device.

- **Recording Issues:**

  - **Permissions:** Always request audio recording permissions before recording.
  - **Audio Mode:** Set the audio mode correctly to allow recording.
  - **Storage:** Make sure there's enough storage space available on the device.

- **General Issues:**
  - **Update Expo and Expo AV:** Make sure you're using the latest versions of Expo and Expo AV.
  - **Clear cache:** Try clearing your app's cache and data.
  - **Restart the development server:** Restart the Expo development server.
