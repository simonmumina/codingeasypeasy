# Puppet Tomcat Management: Modules for Automated Deployment and Configuration

Tomcat is a popular open-source web server and servlet container used to deploy Java-based web applications. Managing Tomcat manually across multiple servers can be a complex and error-prone task. Puppet, a powerful configuration management tool, can automate the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of Tomcat, ensuring consistency and reducing operational overhead. This blog post explores how to leverage Puppet modules for efficient Tomcat management.

## Why Use Puppet for Tomcat Management?

Puppet offers several advantages for managing Tomcat instances:

- **Automation:** Automates the installation, configuration, and deployment of Tomcat.
- **Consistency:** Ensures consistent configurations across all Tomcat servers.
- **Idempotency:** Puppet only applies changes if necessary, preventing unnecessary restarts or modifications.
- **Centralized Management:** Provides a central location to define and manage Tomcat configurations.
- **Version Control:** Enables tracking and managing configuration changes through version control systems like Git.
- **Reduced Errors:** Minimizes manual errors associated with configuration tasks.

## Exploring Available Puppet Modules for Tomcat

Several Puppet modules are available for managing Tomcat. Let's examine some popular options:

- **puppetlabs/tomcat:** This is the official Puppet Labs module and is a widely used and well-maintained option. It provides comprehensive coverage for Tomcat management tasks.
- **nanliu/staging:** While not specific to Tomcat, this module is very helpful for deploying web applications (WAR files) to Tomcat as it allows you to stage the WAR file before deploying it. This is used in conjunction with a Tomcat module.
- **Other Community Modules:** Explore the Puppet Forge for other community-contributed modules, but always evaluate their quality and maintainability before using them in production.

In this blog, we will focus primarily on `puppetlabs/tomcat` as it is considered the de-facto standard.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Puppet master server (or Puppet Enterprise installation).
- One or more nodes running Linux where you want to install and configure Tomcat.
- The Puppet agent installed and configured on those nodes.
- Basic familiarity with Puppet concepts like manifests, classes, and modules.

## Installing the `puppetlabs/tomcat` Module

On your Puppet master server, install the `puppetlabs/tomcat` module using the Puppet module tool:

```plaintext
puppet module install puppetlabs-tomcat
```

## Basic Tomcat Installation and Configuration

Let's start with a basic example to install Tomcat:

```puppet
# Manifest: tomcat_install.pp

class { 'tomcat':
  version => '9.0', # Or your desired Tomcat version
}
```

This simple manifest will:

1.  Download and install the specified Tomcat version.
2.  Create the necessary user and group for Tomcat.
3.  Start the Tomcat service.

To apply this manifest to a node, you can either assign the `tomcat` class in your node's configuration (e.g., in the Puppet Enterprise console or in a site.pp file) or use the `puppet apply` command:

```plaintext
puppet apply tomcat_install.pp
```

## Configuring Tomcat with Puppet

The `puppetlabs/tomcat` module provides numerous parameters to customize your Tomcat installation. Here are some common configuration options:

- **`manage_user` and `manage_group`:** Controls whether Puppet manages the Tomcat user and group. Set to `false` if you want to manage them separately.
- **`user` and `group`:** Specifies the Tomcat user and group names.
- **`install_java`:** Installs a Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) if required.
- **`catalina_home`:** Specifies the Tomcat installation directory.
- **`catalina_base`:** Specifies the Tomcat base directory (for multiple instances).
- **`context_path`:** Define the deployment context path (e.g., '/mywebapp').

Here's an example of configuring Tomcat with specific parameters:

```puppet
# Manifest: tomcat_config.pp

class { 'tomcat':
  version      => '9.0',
  manage_user  => true,
  manage_group => true,
  user         => 'tomcat',
  group        => 'tomcat',
  install_java => true,
  java_home    => '/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64', # Replace with your Java path
  catalina_home => '/opt/tomcat',
  catalina_base => '/opt/tomcat',
}

tomcat::config::server { 'default':
  port => 8080,
}
```

This manifest configures the following:

1.  Sets the Tomcat version to 9.0.
2.  Manages the Tomcat user and group.
3.  Installs Java (if `install_java` is true). Make sure to replace the java_home path with the correct value for your OS.
4.  Sets the `catalina_home` and `catalina_base` directories.
5.  Configures the default server connector port to 8080 using `tomcat::config::server`. This resource allows you to modify the `<Connector>` element in Tomcat's `server.xml` file.

## Deploying WAR Files with Puppet

Deploying web applications (WAR files) is a crucial part of Tomcat management. Here's how you can achieve this using the `puppetlabs/tomcat` module along with the `nanliu/staging` module.

First install the staging module

```plaintext
puppet module install nanliu-staging
```

```puppet
# Manifest: tomcat_deploy.pp

class { 'tomcat':
  version => '9.0',
}

define deploy_war($war_source, $context_path, $user = 'tomcat', $group = 'tomcat', $require = undef){
  staging::file { "${context_path}.war":
    source => $war_source,
    target => "/opt/tomcat/webapps/${context_path}.war",
    owner  => $user,
    group  => $group,
    mode   => '0644',
  }

  tomcat::war { $context_path:
    war_source  => "/opt/tomcat/webapps/${context_path}.war",
    context_path => "/${context_path}",
    require => $require ? [Class['tomcat'],File["/opt/tomcat/webapps/${context_path}.war"],$require] : [Class['tomcat'],File["/opt/tomcat/webapps/${context_path}.war"]]
    ;
  }
}


deploy_war { 'mywebapp':
  war_source => 'puppet:///modules/my_module/mywebapp.war',
  context_path => 'mywebapp',
}

```

This manifest does the following:

1.  **Defines a `deploy_war` defined type:** This encapsulates the deployment logic. It takes the WAR file source, context path, user, group, and optional requirements as parameters.
2.  **Uses `staging::file` from the `nanliu/staging` module:** This stages the WAR file from the specified source (`war_source`) to the Tomcat webapps directory. The `puppet:///` protocol refers to files within your Puppet module. Make sure the `mywebapp.war` file is placed in the `modules/my_module/files/` directory on your Puppet master.
3.  **Uses `tomcat::war`:** This defines the Tomcat web application to be deployed. It specifies the WAR file source (`war_source`) and the context path (`context_path`). This resource manages the deployment of the WAR file, typically involving copying the file to the `webapps` directory and ensuring that Tomcat deploys it correctly. If you already have a database connected, you can use this as a requirement for the deployment.

## Managing Tomcat Service

The `puppetlabs/tomcat` module provides resources to manage the Tomcat service:

```puppet
# Manifest: tomcat_service.pp

class { 'tomcat':
  version => '9.0',
  service_ensure => 'running',  # Ensure the service is running
  service_enable => true,   # Enable the service to start on boot
}
```

This manifest ensures that the Tomcat service is running and enabled to start on boot. You can also use `service_ensure => 'stopped'` to stop the service or `service_ensure => 'absent'` to remove the service entirely.

## Advanced Configuration

The `puppetlabs/tomcat` module offers several advanced configuration options:

- **`tomcat::config::server`:** Used to manage the `server.xml` file, allowing you to configure connectors, listeners, and global resources.
- **`tomcat::config::context`:** Used to manage context files (e.g., `context.xml`) for individual web applications.
- **`tomcat::config::valve`:** Used to configure Tomcat valves, such as access log valves.
- **`tomcat::config::setenv`:** Used to set environment variables for Tomcat.

Here's an example of configuring a custom connector using `tomcat::config::server`:

```puppet
# Manifest: tomcat_connector.pp

class { 'tomcat':
  version => '9.0',
}

tomcat::config::server { 'my_connector':
  port               => 8443,
  protocol           => 'org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol',
  sslEnabled         => true,
  keystoreFile       => '/path/to/keystore.jks',  # Replace with your keystore path
  keystorePass       => 'keystore_password',      # Replace with your keystore password
  maxThreads         => 200,
  scheme             => 'https',
  secure             => true,
  SSLEnabled         => true,
  connector_ensure => 'present',
}
```

This manifest creates a new connector on port 8443 with SSL enabled. Replace `/path/to/keystore.jks` and `keystore_password` with your actual keystore path and password.

## Troubleshooting

- **Check Puppet agent logs:** Examine the Puppet agent logs on the target node for any errors during the application of the manifest.
- **Verify Tomcat logs:** Check the Tomcat logs (e.g., `catalina.out`, `localhost_access_log.*.txt`) for any errors or warnings related to the deployment or configuration.
- **Test web application access:** After deployment, verify that your web application is accessible through a web browser.
- **Incorrect Java version** Ensure the java version defined within the hiera file for the module or within the puppet manifest for the node matches the java version installed on the machine.

## Best Practices

- **Use Hiera for Data Separation:** Store configuration data like passwords, usernames, and file paths in Hiera to separate data from code.
- **Version Control Your Puppet Code:** Store your Puppet manifests and modules in a version control system like Git.
- **Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your Puppet code in a non-production environment before deploying it to production.
- **Use Modular Design:** Break down your configurations into smaller, reusable modules.
- **Keep Modules Updated:** Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of the `puppetlabs/tomcat` and other modules to benefit from bug fixes and new features.
- **Idempotency is Key:** Ensure all manifests are idempotent by using only the `creates`, `onlyif`, and `unless` flags.

## Conclusion

Puppet and the `puppetlabs/tomcat` module provide a robust solution for automating Tomcat management. By leveraging Puppet's features and the module's extensive capabilities, you can streamline your Tomcat deployments, ensure consistent configurations, and reduce operational overhead. Remember to thoroughly test your configurations and follow best practices for Puppet development. This approach will help you create a more reliable and efficient Tomcat environment. Good luck!
