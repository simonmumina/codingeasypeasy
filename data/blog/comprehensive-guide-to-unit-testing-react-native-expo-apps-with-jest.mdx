# Comprehensive Guide to Unit Testing React Native Expo Apps with Jest

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring the reliability and maintainability of your code. In the React Native ecosystem, specifically when using Expo, setting up and executing unit tests can seem daunting at first. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of unit testing React Native Expo applications using Jest, covering everything from initial setup to advanced mocking techniques and best practices.

## Why Unit Testing Matters for React Native Expo Apps

Before diving into the specifics, let's understand why unit testing is so important for React Native Expo development:

- **Early Bug Detection:** Identify and fix issues early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and complexity of fixing bugs later.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Encourages writing modular and testable code, leading to better design and maintainability.
- **Refactoring Confidence:** Allows you to confidently refactor your code without fear of introducing regressions, as the tests will verify that the changes haven't broken existing functionality.
- **Collaboration and Documentation:** Serves as living documentation, clarifying the intended behavior of your code for other developers (and your future self!).
- **Reduced Risk:** Minimizes the risk of deploying faulty code to production, leading to a more stable and reliable application.

## Setting Up Jest for Your Expo Project

Expo provides a seamless experience for setting up Jest. Usually, when you initialize an Expo project, Jest is already configured. However, if you're unsure or upgrading an older project, here's how to ensure Jest is properly set up:

1.  **Install Jest and related dependencies (if not already present):**

    ```plaintext
    npx expo install --fix-dependencies
    yarn add --dev jest jest-expo @testing-library/react-native @testing-library/jest-dom identity-obj-proxy
    ```

    - `jest`: The core Jest testing framework.
    - `jest-expo`: Provides Expo-specific mocking and configuration for Jest.
    - `@testing-library/react-native`: A recommended library for writing more maintainable and user-centric tests for React Native components. Focuses on testing the rendered output as a user would interact with it.
    - `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Jest matchers for testing DOM elements (useful for testing component behavior).
    - `identity-obj-proxy`: A workaround for handling CSS Modules or other non-JavaScript assets during testing. We'll discuss this further below.

2.  **Configure `package.json` with test script:**

    Add or modify the `test` script in your `package.json` file:

    ```plaintext
    {
      "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Create `jest.config.js` (if it doesn't exist) in the root directory of your project:**

    This file will contain your Jest configuration. Here's a typical configuration for an Expo project:

    ```plaintext
    // jest.config.js
    module.exports = {
      preset: 'jest-expo',
      transformIgnorePatterns: [
        'node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@unimodules/.*|unimodules|sentry-expo|native-base|react-native-screens|react-native-reanimated)',
      ],
      setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'],
      moduleNameMapper: {
        '.+\\.(css|styl|less|sass|scss|png|jpg|ttf|woff|woff2)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
      },
    }
    ```

    - `preset: 'jest-expo'`: This sets up the Jest environment for Expo, including necessary mocks and configurations.
    - `transformIgnorePatterns`: This is crucial for handling modules that use modern JavaScript syntax or need transformation before being understood by Jest. The regex prevents Jest from transforming modules within `node_modules` _except_ for the ones listed. Adjust this list if you encounter transformation errors with other libraries. Libraries outside node_modules usually don't need to be transformed.
    - `setupFilesAfterEnv`: Specifies files that will be run after the Jest environment has been set up. `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` adds useful DOM-specific matchers to Jest's `expect` object.
    - `moduleNameMapper`: This is a workaround for handling CSS Modules, images, or other non-JavaScript assets. It tells Jest to use `identity-obj-proxy` for any file matching the specified extensions. `identity-obj-proxy` effectively mocks these assets, allowing your tests to run without actually needing to load or process them.

## Writing Your First Unit Test

Let's create a simple React Native component and write a unit test for it.

**1. Create a component:**

Create a file named `components/Greeting.js`:

```plaintext
// components/Greeting.js
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, {name}!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 16,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 18,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
})

export default Greeting
```

**2. Create a test file:**

Create a file named `components/Greeting.test.js` (note the `.test.js` extension):

```plaintext
// components/Greeting.test.js
import React from 'react'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react-native'
import Greeting from './Greeting'

describe('Greeting Component', () => {
  it('should render the greeting message with the provided name', () => {
    render(<Greeting name="John" />)
    const greetingText = screen.getByText('Hello, John!')
    expect(greetingText).toBeDefined()
  })

  it('should render the greeting message with a different name', () => {
    render(<Greeting name="Jane" />)
    const greetingText = screen.getByText('Hello, Jane!')
    expect(greetingText).toBeVisible()
  })

  it('should have a container with background color', () => {
    const { getByTestId } = render(<Greeting name="Test" />)
    const container = getByTestId('greeting-container') //Added testID to view.

    expect(container).toBeDefined()
    // Add more assertions based on your styles, e.g., check background color.
  })

  it('should have a text with font size', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<Greeting name="Test" />)
    const textElement = getByText('Hello, Test!')

    expect(textElement).toBeDefined()
  })
})
```

**Explanation of the test file:**

- **`describe('Greeting Component', () => { ... });`**: This defines a test suite, grouping related tests together.
- **`it('should render the greeting message with the provided name', () => { ... });`**: This defines a single test case.
- **`render(<Greeting name="John" />);`**: This renders the `Greeting` component with the `name` prop set to "John".
- **`const greetingText = screen.getByText('Hello, John!');`**: This uses `@testing-library/react-native` to find the element containing the text "Hello, John!". `screen` provides a convenient way to access query functions like `getByText`. `getByText` throws an error if the element is not found, which is good because it means your test will fail if the expected text isn't present.
- **`expect(greetingText).toBeDefined();`**: This is an assertion using Jest's `expect` API. It verifies that the `greetingText` element was found and is not `null` or `undefined`.
- **`expect(greetingText).toBeVisible();`**: This is also an assertion using `@testing-library/jest-dom`, checking if greetingText element is visible
- **Adding testID:** To be able to test some properties we need to add `testID` to element, in our case it's View

  ```plaintext
  // components/Greeting.js
  import React from 'react'
  import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

  const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container} testID="greeting-container">
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, {name}!</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }

  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      padding: 16,
      backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    },
    text: {
      fontSize: 18,
      fontWeight: 'bold',
    },
  })

  export default Greeting
  ```

**3. Run the tests:**

Run the following command in your terminal:

```plaintext
yarn test
```

Jest will execute the tests and report the results. You should see that all tests have passed.

## Mocking in Unit Tests

Mocking is a crucial technique in unit testing. It allows you to isolate the component being tested from its dependencies, preventing external factors (like API calls, database connections, or complex calculations) from affecting the test results.

Here are common scenarios where mocking is essential:

- **API Calls:** Replace real API calls with mocked responses to control the data returned and avoid network dependencies during testing.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Mock external libraries to simplify their behavior and ensure that your component is not tightly coupled to their specific implementation.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Control the timing and behavior of asynchronous operations like `setTimeout` or Promises.
- **React Native Modules:** Mock native modules (e.g., `AsyncStorage`, `Location`) to simulate their behavior in a controlled environment.

### Mocking API Calls with `jest.mock`

Let's say you have a component that fetches data from an API:

```plaintext
// components/UserData.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

const UserData = () => {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
        const data = await response.json()
        setUserData(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error)
      }
    }

    fetchData()
  }, [])

  if (!userData) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Name: {userData.name}</Text>
      <Text>Email: {userData.email}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default UserData
```

Here's how you can mock the `fetch` API in your test:

```plaintext
// components/UserData.test.js
import React from 'react'
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react-native'
import UserData from './UserData'

// Mock the global fetch function
global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
  Promise.resolve({
    json: () => Promise.resolve({ name: 'Mocked User', email: 'mocked@example.com' }),
  })
)

describe('UserData Component', () => {
  it('should display user data after fetching', async () => {
    render(<UserData />)

    // Wait for the data to load and be displayed
    await waitFor(() => screen.getByText('Name: Mocked User'))
    expect(screen.getByText('Name: Mocked User')).toBeVisible()
    expect(screen.getByText('Email: mocked@example.com')).toBeVisible()

    // Verify that fetch was called once
    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
    // Verify the URL called
    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`global.fetch = jest.fn(() => ...);`**: This replaces the global `fetch` function with a Jest mock function. The mock function returns a Promise that resolves to a mocked response containing the desired user data.
- **`await waitFor(() => screen.getByText('Name: Mocked User'));`**: This waits for the "Name: Mocked User" text to appear in the rendered output. `waitFor` is essential when testing asynchronous operations, as it ensures that the test doesn't complete before the data has been fetched and rendered. Without it, you might get false negatives.
- **`expect(screen.getByText('Name: Mocked User')).toBeVisible();`**: This verifies that the mocked user data is displayed correctly.
- **`expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);`**: This assertion confirms that the mocked `fetch` function was called exactly once.
- **`expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1');`**: This assertion confirm that the correct URL was called

**Important Considerations when Mocking `fetch`:**

- **`global.fetch` vs. `jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch')`:** You can use `jest.spyOn` instead of directly assigning to `global.fetch`. `jest.spyOn` creates a mock function that also tracks calls to the original function, allowing you to assert on the arguments passed to `fetch`, but it's generally not necessary to spy in this simple case.
- **Mocking Different API Responses:** You can configure the mock function to return different responses based on the input URL or other conditions, allowing you to test different scenarios, such as error handling or different data states.
- **Resetting Mocks:** Use `jest.clearAllMocks()` or `jest.resetAllMocks()` in `beforeEach` or `afterEach` hooks to reset the mock function between tests and prevent unexpected behavior.

### Mocking React Native Modules

React Native often relies on native modules for platform-specific functionality. When unit testing, you need to mock these modules to avoid platform dependencies and control their behavior.

Let's say you use `AsyncStorage` in your component to save and retrieve data:

```plaintext
// components/DataStorage.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native'
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage'

const DataStorage = () => {
  const [storedData, setStoredData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadData = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myData')
        setStoredData(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading data:', error)
      }
    }

    loadData()
  }, [])

  const saveData = async () => {
    try {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('myData', 'This is saved data!')
      setStoredData('This is saved data!')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error saving data:', error)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Stored Data: {storedData || 'No data stored'}</Text>
      <Button title="Save Data" onPress={saveData} />
    </View>
  )
}

export default DataStorage
```

Here's how you can mock `AsyncStorage` in your test:

```plaintext
// components/DataStorage.test.js
import React from 'react'
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react-native'
import DataStorage from './DataStorage'
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage'

// Mock AsyncStorage
jest.mock('@react-native-async-storage/async-storage', () => ({
  setItem: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
  getItem: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve('Initial Stored Data')),
  removeItem: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
  clear: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
}))

describe('DataStorage Component', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    AsyncStorage.getItem.mockClear()
    AsyncStorage.setItem.mockClear()
  })

  it('should display initial stored data on mount', async () => {
    render(<DataStorage />)

    // Wait for data to load
    await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByText('Stored Data: Initial Stored Data')).toBeVisible())
    expect(AsyncStorage.getItem).toHaveBeenCalledWith('myData')
  })

  it('should save data when the button is pressed', async () => {
    render(<DataStorage />)

    const saveDataButton = screen.getByText('Save Data')
    fireEvent.press(saveDataButton)

    // Wait for the data to save
    await waitFor(() =>
      expect(AsyncStorage.setItem).toHaveBeenCalledWith('myData', 'This is saved data!')
    )

    // Wait for the state to update
    await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByText('Stored Data: This is saved data!')).toBeVisible())
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

- **`jest.mock('@react-native-async-storage/async-storage', () => ({ ... }));`**: This uses `jest.mock` to replace the `AsyncStorage` module with a mock implementation.
- **Mock Implementation:** The mock implementation provides mock functions for `setItem`, `getItem`, `removeItem`, and `clear`. These mock functions return Promises that resolve immediately, simulating the behavior of `AsyncStorage` without actually interacting with native storage.
- **`expect(AsyncStorage.getItem).toHaveBeenCalledWith('myData');`**: This assertion verifies that `AsyncStorage.getItem` was called with the expected key ('myData').
- **`fireEvent.press(saveDataButton);`**: This simulates a user pressing the "Save Data" button.
- **`await waitFor(() => expect(AsyncStorage.setItem).toHaveBeenCalledWith('myData', 'This is saved data!'));`**: This waits for the `AsyncStorage.setItem` function to be called with the expected arguments.

**Key Takeaways for Mocking Native Modules:**

- **`jest.mock` is your friend:** Use `jest.mock` to replace the module with your mock implementation.
- **Provide realistic mock implementations:** Try to mimic the behavior of the original module as closely as possible.
- **Test module interactions:** Assert that the module's functions are called with the correct arguments.
- **Don't forget to clear the mocks** It's good practice to clear the mocks before running each test.

### Mocking Functions Within Modules

Sometimes, you need to mock a specific function within a module without mocking the entire module. You can use `jest.spyOn` for this.

Example :

```plaintext
//utils/helpers.js
export const myFunction = () => {
  // some logic
  return 'original value'
}
```

```plaintext
//component.js
import { myFunction } from '../utils/helpers'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const value = myFunction()
  return <Text>{value}</Text>
}
```

```plaintext
//component.test.js
import { myFunction } from '../utils/helpers'
import MyComponent from './component'

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should render value from myFunction', () => {
    jest.spyOn(myFunction).mockReturnValue('mocked value')
    const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />)
    expect(getByText('mocked value')).toBeTruthy()
  })
})
```

## Testing Asynchronous Code

Testing asynchronous code requires careful consideration of timing and event loops. Jest provides tools like `async/await` and `waitFor` to handle asynchronous operations gracefully.

### Using `async/await`

`async/await` simplifies testing asynchronous code by allowing you to write asynchronous tests in a synchronous style.

Let's revisit the `UserData` component from the API mocking example:

```plaintext
// components/UserData.test.js
import React from 'react'
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react-native'
import UserData from './UserData'

// Mock the global fetch function
global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
  Promise.resolve({
    json: () => Promise.resolve({ name: 'Mocked User', email: 'mocked@example.com' }),
  })
)

describe('UserData Component', () => {
  it('should display user data after fetching', async () => {
    // Mark the test function as async
    render(<UserData />)

    // Wait for the data to load and be displayed
    await waitFor(() => screen.getByText('Name: Mocked User'))
    expect(screen.getByText('Name: Mocked User')).toBeVisible()
    expect(screen.getByText('Email: mocked@example.com')).toBeVisible()

    // Verify that fetch was called once
    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  })
})
```

The `async` keyword before the `it` function indicates that the test function is asynchronous. The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the test until the `waitFor` Promise resolves.

### Using `waitFor`

`waitFor` from `@testing-library/react-native` is extremely useful for waiting for UI updates to occur after asynchronous operations. It polls the DOM until a specific condition is met or a timeout is reached.

```plaintext
await waitFor(() => screen.getByText('Name: Mocked User'))
```

This waits for the "Name: Mocked User" text to appear in the rendered output before proceeding with the assertions.

**Best Practices for Testing Asynchronous Code:**

- **Use `async/await` for cleaner syntax.**
- **Use `waitFor` to wait for UI updates.**
- **Set appropriate timeouts for `waitFor` to prevent tests from hanging indefinitely.** The default timeout is usually sufficient, but you may need to adjust it depending on the complexity of your asynchronous operations.
- **Handle errors gracefully:** Use `try...catch` blocks to catch errors that may occur during asynchronous operations and assert that the errors are handled correctly.

## Best Practices for Effective Unit Testing

Here are some best practices to follow when writing unit tests for your React Native Expo applications:

- **Write isolated tests:** Each unit test should focus on testing a single unit of code (e.g., a component, a function) in isolation. Use mocking to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies.
- **Follow the AAA pattern:** Arrange, Act, Assert. Organize your tests into three clear sections:
  - **Arrange:** Set up the necessary preconditions for the test (e.g., mock data, initialize components).
  - **Act:** Execute the code under test (e.g., render a component, call a function).
  - **Assert:** Verify that the code behaved as expected (e.g., check the rendered output, verify function calls).
- **Write clear and concise tests:** Tests should be easy to understand and maintain. Use descriptive names for test suites and test cases.
- **Test edge cases and error conditions:** Don't just test the happy path. Write tests to handle edge cases, invalid inputs, and error conditions.
- **Keep tests fast:** Slow tests can significantly slow down your development workflow. Optimize your tests to run as quickly as possible. Avoid unnecessary network requests or database interactions during testing.
- **Run tests frequently:** Integrate your tests into your development workflow. Run tests whenever you make changes to your code. Use continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests on every commit.
- **Refactor your tests:** Just like your application code, your tests should be refactored periodically to improve their readability, maintainability, and performance.
- **Code Coverage:** Aim for a reasonable code coverage percentage (e.g., 80-90%), but don't obsess over it. Code coverage is just one metric and doesn't guarantee the quality of your tests. Focus on writing meaningful tests that cover the important aspects of your code.

## Conclusion

Unit testing is an essential practice for building robust and maintainable React Native Expo applications. By following the guidelines and techniques outlined in this guide, you can write effective unit tests that will help you catch bugs early, improve code quality, and reduce the risk of deploying faulty code. Remember to embrace testing as an integral part of your development workflow and continuously strive to improve your testing skills.
