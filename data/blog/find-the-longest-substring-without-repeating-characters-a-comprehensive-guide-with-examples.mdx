# Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

This blog post delves into the classic computer science problem of finding the longest substring within a given string that contains no repeating characters. This problem is a staple in coding interviews and a great way to demonstrate your understanding of string manipulation and algorithmic efficiency. We'll explore the problem statement, different approaches to solve it, and provide clear, concise code examples in Javascript.

## Understanding the Problem

**Problem Statement:**

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Examples:**

- **Input:** `s = "abcabcbb"`
  **Output:** `3` (The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.)

- **Input:** `s = "bbbbb"`
  **Output:** `1` (The answer is "b", with the length of 1.)

- **Input:** `s = "pwwkew"`
  **Output:** `3` (The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.)

- **Input:** `s = ""`
  **Output:** `0`

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Brute Force Approach (Naive Solution)

The most straightforward, albeit inefficient, approach is to generate all possible substrings and check if each substring contains repeating characters. This involves nested loops and character comparisons.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Iterate through all possible starting indices of substrings (from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the string).
2.  For each starting index, iterate through all possible ending indices (from the starting index to `n-1`).
3.  For each substring formed by the starting and ending indices, check if it contains repeating characters.
4.  If the substring does not contain repeating characters, update the maximum length if the current substring's length is greater than the current maximum.

**Javascript Code:**

```plaintext
function lengthOfLongestSubstringBruteForce(s) {
  let maxLength = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i; j < s.length; j++) {
      const substring = s.substring(i, j + 1);
      if (areAllCharactersUnique(substring)) {
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, substring.length);
      }
    }
  }
  return maxLength;

  function areAllCharactersUnique(str) {
    const charSet = new Set();
    for (let char of str) {
      if (charSet.has(char)) {
        return false;
      }
      charSet.add(char);
    }
    return true;
  }
}

// Example Usage
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringBruteForce("abcabcbb")); // Output: 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringBruteForce("bbbbb"));   // Output: 1
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringBruteForce("pwwkew"));  // Output: 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringBruteForce(""));        // Output: 0
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^3) - We have nested loops that iterate up to `n` times, and the `areAllCharactersUnique` function takes O(n) time in the worst case.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the `areAllCharactersUnique` function, the `charSet` can grow to store up to `n` characters in the worst case.

**Why this is not optimal:** The brute force approach is inefficient because it repeatedly checks substrings that share overlapping sections. We can do better.

## Sliding Window Technique (Optimized Solution)

The sliding window technique is a more efficient approach to solve this problem. It involves maintaining a "window" that represents a potential substring without repeating characters. We expand the window to the right as long as we encounter unique characters. If we encounter a repeating character, we shrink the window from the left until the repeating character is removed.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Initialize a `Set` or `Map` to keep track of the characters within the current window.
2.  Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at index 0. These pointers define the boundaries of the sliding window.
3.  Initialize a variable `maxLength` to 0 to store the maximum length of the substring found so far.
4.  Iterate through the string using the `right` pointer.
5.  For each character at the `right` pointer:
    - If the character is already present in the `Set/Map`, it means we have a repeating character.
    - Shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right until the repeating character is removed from the window. Remove the characters encountered while shrinking the window from the `Set/Map`.
    - Add the character at the `right` pointer to the `Set/Map`.
    - Update `maxLength` with the maximum of `maxLength` and the current window size (`right - left + 1`).
6.  Move the `right` pointer to the next character.
7.  Return `maxLength`.

**Javascript Code (Using a Set):**

```plaintext
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
  let maxLength = 0;
  let left = 0;
  let charSet = new Set();

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    while (charSet.has(s[right])) {
      charSet.delete(s[left]);
      left++;
    }
    charSet.add(s[right]);
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
  }

  return maxLength;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb")); // Output: 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb"));   // Output: 1
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew"));  // Output: 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring(""));        // Output: 0
```

**Javascript Code (Using a Map):**

```plaintext
function lengthOfLongestSubstringMap(s) {
  let maxLength = 0;
  let left = 0;
  let charMap = new Map();

  for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
    if (charMap.has(s[right])) {
      // Move left to the position after the previous occurrence of s[right]
      left = Math.max(left, charMap.get(s[right]) + 1);
    }
    charMap.set(s[right], right); // Store the current index
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
  }

  return maxLength;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringMap("abcabcbb")); // Output: 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringMap("bbbbb"));   // Output: 1
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringMap("pwwkew"));  // Output: 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstringMap(""));        // Output: 0
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - The `right` pointer iterates through the string once. The `left` pointer may iterate through a portion of the string multiple times in the worst case, but on average, it iterates at most `n` times. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear.

**Space Complexity:** O(min(m, n)) - The space complexity is determined by the `Set/Map`, which can store at most the number of unique characters in the string (`m`) or the length of the string (`n`), whichever is smaller. In the worst-case scenario where all characters are unique, the space complexity is O(n). However, if the string contains a limited number of unique characters, the space complexity is O(m).

## Key Takeaways

- The sliding window technique provides an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).
- Using a `Set` or `Map` allows us to quickly check if a character is already present in the current window.
- Understanding the problem constraints can help you choose the appropriate data structure and algorithm for optimal performance.
- This problem is frequently asked in coding interviews and demonstrates your ability to apply algorithmic thinking to solve string manipulation problems.

## Conclusion

Finding the longest substring without repeating characters is a classic problem that highlights the importance of efficient algorithms. By understanding the sliding window technique and choosing the appropriate data structures, you can solve this problem with optimal time and space complexity. Practice this problem and similar string manipulation problems to improve your coding skills and prepare for coding interviews.
