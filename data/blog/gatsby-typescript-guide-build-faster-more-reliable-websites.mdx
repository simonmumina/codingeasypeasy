# Gatsby TypeScript Guide: Build Faster, More Reliable Websites

Gatsby is a powerful static site generator that allows you to build performant and SEO-friendly websites with React. While JavaScript is the standard language for React, using TypeScript with Gatsby can significantly improve your development experience by providing static typing, better code maintainability, and reduced runtime errors. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of setting up Gatsby with TypeScript, covering everything from initial project setup to advanced techniques.

## Why Use TypeScript with Gatsby?

Before diving into the "how," let's explore the "why." TypeScript offers several benefits that make it an excellent choice for Gatsby projects:

- **Static Typing:** TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, allowing you to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime, leading to more robust and reliable code.
- **Improved Code Maintainability:** Explicit type definitions make your code easier to understand and maintain, especially in large projects. Other developers (and your future self!) can quickly grasp the purpose and expected behavior of different parts of the codebase.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience:** TypeScript provides features like autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring support in your IDE, significantly improving your developer experience and productivity.
- **Reduced Runtime Errors:** By catching type-related errors during development, TypeScript helps prevent unexpected crashes and bugs in production.
- **Better Collaboration:** When working in a team, TypeScript provides a common language and a clear contract between different parts of the codebase, making collaboration easier and more effective.

## Setting Up a New Gatsby Project with TypeScript

The easiest way to start a new Gatsby project with TypeScript is using the Gatsby CLI. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
gatsby new my-gatsby-typescript-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-typescript
```

This command does the following:

1.  `gatsby new`: Invokes the Gatsby CLI to create a new project.
2.  `my-gatsby-typescript-site`: Specifies the name of your new project directory. Feel free to change this to something more appropriate for your website.
3.  `https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-typescript`: Specifies the Gatsby starter to use. In this case, we're using the official `gatsby-starter-typescript`, which is pre-configured for TypeScript.

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:

```plaintext
cd my-gatsby-typescript-site
```

Now, install the necessary dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install  # or yarn install
```

Finally, start the development server:

```plaintext
gatsby develop
```

This will start a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the default Gatsby starter page.

## Understanding the Project Structure

The `gatsby-starter-typescript` provides a basic project structure that includes TypeScript configuration. Let's take a look at some key files:

- **`gatsby-config.ts`:** This file contains the configuration for your Gatsby site, including plugins, metadata, and other settings. It's written in TypeScript.
- **`gatsby-node.ts`:** This file allows you to customize Gatsby's build process. You can use it to create pages programmatically, transform data, and more. It's also written in TypeScript.
- **`src/pages/`:** This directory contains the React components that define the pages of your website. These components are typically written in TypeScript.
- **`src/components/`:** This directory is for reusable React components used across your site. These are also written in TypeScript.
- **`src/images/`:** This directory is for storing your images.
- **`src/types/`:** This directory is excellent for holding global type definitions to be used throughout your project. This can enforce a standard typing of data used in GraphQL.
- **`tsconfig.json`:** This file configures the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the compiler options, include/exclude patterns, and other settings.

## Writing TypeScript Components

Let's create a simple TypeScript component to display a greeting. Create a new file named `src/components/Greeting.tsx` (the `.tsx` extension is used for React components that contain JSX):

```plaintext
import React from 'react'

interface GreetingProps {
  name: string
}

const Greeting: React.FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
}

export default Greeting
```

In this example:

- We define an interface `GreetingProps` to specify the type of the `name` prop. This is good practice for writing readable and type-safe components.
- We use `React.FC<GreetingProps>` to define the functional component type. `React.FC` is a shorthand for `React.FunctionComponent` and is the recommended way to type functional components in React with TypeScript. The `<GreetingProps>` part specifies the props that the component accepts.
- We return JSX to render the greeting.

Now, let's use this component in our `src/pages/index.tsx` file:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'
import Greeting from '../components/Greeting'

const IndexPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my Gatsby site!</h1>
      <Greeting name="World" />
      <p>
        Go to <Link to="/page-2/">page 2</Link>
      </p>
    </main>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
```

Now, when you refresh your browser, you should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the homepage.

## Using GraphQL with TypeScript

Gatsby uses GraphQL to fetch data from various sources. TypeScript can help you ensure type safety when working with GraphQL data.

Let's say you want to fetch the title of your site from `gatsby-config.ts`. You can use GraphQL to query this data and then use TypeScript to define the type of the data you expect to receive.

First, create a type definition for your site metadata in `src/types/global.d.ts`:

```plaintext
interface SiteMetaData {
  title: string
}

interface Site {
  siteMetadata: SiteMetaData
}

export interface GatsbyTypes {
  site: Site
}
```

Then, update `src/pages/index.tsx` to query the site title using GraphQL and use the defined type:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { Link, graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
import Greeting from '../components/Greeting'
import { GatsbyTypes } from '../types/global'

const IndexPage: React.FC = () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery<GatsbyTypes>(graphql`
    query SiteTitleQuery {
      site {
        siteMetadata {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to {data.site.siteMetadata.title}!</h1>
      <Greeting name="World" />
      <p>
        Go to <Link to="/page-2/">page 2</Link>
      </p>
    </main>
  )
}

export default IndexPage
```

In this example:

- We use `useStaticQuery<GatsbyTypes>` to specify the type of the data returned by the GraphQL query. This ensures that TypeScript knows the structure of the data and can provide type checking.
- We access the site title using `data.site.siteMetadata.title`. TypeScript will verify that this property exists and has the correct type based on our `GatsbyTypes` interface.

## Type Checking with Gatsby Develop

Gatsby will automatically type check your TypeScript code during development when using the `gatsby develop` command. If there are any type errors, they will be displayed in the terminal and in your browser's developer console.

## Using Gatsby Plugins with TypeScript

Many Gatsby plugins are compatible with TypeScript. However, some plugins may not have type definitions available. If you encounter a plugin without type definitions, you have a few options:

1.  **Check DefinitelyTyped:** DefinitelyTyped is a repository of community-maintained TypeScript type definitions for JavaScript libraries. Search on npm using `@types/<package-name>` to see if a type definition exists. For example, if you're using `gatsby-plugin-image`, check for `@types/gatsby-plugin-image`. If it exists, install it:

    ```plaintext
    npm install --save-dev @types/gatsby-plugin-image
    ```

2.  **Create Your Own Type Definitions:** If a type definition doesn't exist, you can create your own. Create a file named `src/types/gatsby-plugin-name.d.ts` where `gatsby-plugin-name` is the name of the plugin (replace dashes with underscores). For example, `src/types/gatsby-plugin-sharp.d.ts`. Inside the file, declare the module and define the types you need:

    ```plaintext
    declare module 'gatsby-plugin-sharp' {
      // Define the types for the plugin here
      export interface GatsbyImageSharpFixed {
        width: number
        height: number
        src: string
        srcSet: string
      }

      export interface GatsbyImageSharpFluid {
        base64: string
        aspectRatio: number
        src: string
        srcSet: string
        sizes: string
      }
    }
    ```

    **Important:** The above is an **example** and you need to replace the code with actual type declarations for the `gatsby-plugin-sharp` based on what features you are using in the code.

3.  **Use `any` (as a last resort):** If you can't find or create type definitions, you can use the `any` type to bypass type checking. However, this should be avoided as much as possible, as it defeats the purpose of using TypeScript. If you have to use `any`, consider adding a comment explaining why and potentially create an issue for the plugin maintainers to add proper type definitions.

## Linting and Formatting with ESLint and Prettier

To ensure code consistency and quality, it's recommended to use ESLint and Prettier in your Gatsby TypeScript projects.

1.  **Install ESLint and Prettier:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-import
    ```

2.  **Configure ESLint:** Create a `.eslintrc.js` file in the root of your project:

    ```plaintext
    module.exports = {
      parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
      plugins: ['@typescript-eslint', 'react', 'react-hooks', 'import'],
      extends: [
        'eslint:recommended',
        'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
        'plugin:react/recommended',
        'plugin:react-hooks/recommended',
        'plugin:import/errors',
        'plugin:import/warnings',
        'plugin:import/typescript',
        'prettier', // Uses eslint-config-prettier to disable ESLint rules from @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin that would conflict with prettier
      ],
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 2020,
        sourceType: 'module',
        ecmaFeatures: {
          jsx: true,
        },
      },
      settings: {
        react: {
          version: 'detect',
        },
        'import/resolver': {
          typescript: {}, // this loads <rootdir>/tsconfig.json to eslint
        },
      },
      rules: {
        'react/prop-types': 'off', // TypeScript handles prop types
        'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off', // Gatsby provides React
        '@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type': 'off',
        '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'warn', // Adjust this based on your preference
        'import/order': [
          'warn',
          {
            groups: ['builtin', 'external', 'parent', 'sibling', 'index'],
            'newlines-between': 'always',
          },
        ],
      },
    }
    ```

3.  **Configure Prettier:** Create a `.prettierrc.js` file in the root of your project:

    ```plaintext
    module.exports = {
      semi: false,
      trailingComma: 'all',
      singleQuote: true,
      printWidth: 100,
      tabWidth: 2,
    }
    ```

4.  **Add ESLint and Prettier Scripts to `package.json`:**

    ```plaintext
    {
      "scripts": {
        "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
        "format": "prettier --write ."
      }
    }
    ```

Now you can run `npm run lint` to check for ESLint errors and `npm run format` to automatically format your code with Prettier. You can also integrate ESLint and Prettier into your IDE to automatically check and format your code as you type.

## Best Practices for Gatsby TypeScript Projects

Here are some best practices to follow when building Gatsby projects with TypeScript:

- **Use interfaces and types liberally:** Define interfaces and types for all your data and components to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.
- **Keep your types up-to-date:** As your project evolves, make sure to update your type definitions to reflect changes in your data and components.
- **Use `React.FC` for functional components:** Use `React.FC` to properly type your functional components.
- **Handle optional props carefully:** Use optional properties and default values to handle cases where props may be missing.
- **Keep your components small and focused:** Small, well-defined components are easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Use a consistent coding style:** Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent coding style throughout your project.
- **Document your code:** Add comments to explain complex logic and type definitions.
