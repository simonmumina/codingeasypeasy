# Extending Web2py DAL: Custom Data Types, Virtual Fields, and Database Adapters

Web2py's Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) is a powerful tool for interacting with databases in a database-agnostic way. It simplifies database operations, prevents SQL injection, and allows you to switch between different database backends with minimal code changes. However, sometimes the built-in functionalities are not enough to meet the specific requirements of your application. This blog post will explore how to extend Web2py's DAL by implementing custom data types, virtual fields, and even creating custom database adapters.

## Why Extend the DAL?

The DAL is designed to be flexible and extensible. You might want to extend it for several reasons:

- **Custom Data Types:** Handle specialized data formats (e.g., geographic coordinates, currency conversions, encrypted data) that aren't directly supported by standard database types.
- **Virtual Fields:** Calculate values on the fly based on existing database fields, without storing them in the database itself. This is great for derived values, aggregations, or computed properties.
- **Database Adapter Modifications:** If you're working with a less common database system or need to optimize certain queries in a specific way, you might need to customize the database adapter.
- **Code Reusability:** Encapsulate complex database logic into reusable components, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

## 1. Custom Data Types

Web2py allows you to define custom data types that represent application-specific data structures. These custom types can be validated and formatted before being stored in the database.

### Defining a Custom Data Type

Let's create a custom data type called `geo_point` to store latitude and longitude coordinates.

```plaintext
from gluon import Field
from gluon.dal import FieldVirtual

class geo_point(FieldVirtual):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(geo_point, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.type = 'string'  # Store as a string in the database
        self.requires = self.validate_geo_point()

    def validate_geo_point(self):
        from gluon.validators import Validator, ValidationError

        class GeoPointValidator(Validator):
            def __call__(self, value, form):
                try:
                    lat, lon = map(float, value.split(','))
                    if not (-90 <= lat <= 90 and -180 <= lon <= 180):
                        raise ValidationError(self.messages['invalid'], value)
                    return (lat, lon)
                except (ValueError, TypeError):
                    raise ValidationError(self.messages['invalid'], value)
            messages = {'invalid': 'Invalid geo_point format (lat,lon).'}
        return GeoPointValidator()

    def represent(self, value, row=None):
        """How the value is displayed."""
        if value:
            return f"({value})"
        return ""

    def to_db(self, value):
        """How the value is stored in the database."""
        if isinstance(value, tuple):  #Expects a tuple from validation
          return f"{value[0]},{value[1]}"
        return value  # Should be a string from form processing

    def from_db(self, value):
        """How the value is retrieved from the database."""
        if value:
            lat, lon = map(float, value.split(','))
            return (lat, lon)  #Return a tuple
        return None

# usage inside model definition
db.define_table('locations',
    Field('name'),
    geo_point('coordinates') #Use the geo_point custom type
)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`geo_point(FieldVirtual)`:** We inherit from `FieldVirtual` because we're handling the database interactions ourselves through the `to_db` and `from_db` methods.
- **`self.type = 'string'`:** We specify that this data type will be stored as a string in the database. You can choose any suitable database type.
- **`self.requires = self.validate_geo_point()`:** We create a custom validator `GeoPointValidator` to ensure the data is in the correct format (latitude, longitude) and within valid ranges.
- **`validate_geo_point()`:** This method defines the custom validator class, handling error messages and validation logic.
- **`represent(self, value, row=None)`:** This method defines how the value will be displayed in the view (e.g., in a form or grid).
- **`to_db(self, value)`:** This method converts the validated `(lat, lon)` tuple into a comma-separated string before storing it in the database.
- **`from_db(self, value)`:** This method converts the comma-separated string retrieved from the database back into a `(lat, lon)` tuple.

**How to use:**

In your controller:

```plaintext
def insert_location():
    form = SQLFORM(db.locations)
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = 'Record inserted!'
        redirect(URL('insert_location'))
    elif form.errors:
        response.flash = 'Form has errors'
    return dict(form=form)
```

Your `insert_location.html` view will automatically render a text field for the `coordinates` field. Entering values like `40.7128,-74.0060` will be validated and stored. The `represent` method will format the displayed value.

### Other Examples of Custom Data Types

- **Currency:** You could create a `currency` type that stores the amount and currency code, with methods for currency conversion.
- **Encrypted Text:** A type that automatically encrypts and decrypts sensitive data before storing it in the database.
- **JSON Data:** While many databases support JSON natively now, you could create a custom type to handle specific JSON schemas or validation rules.

## 2. Virtual Fields

Virtual fields are calculated dynamically and aren't stored directly in the database. They're useful for derived values, aggregations, and computed properties.

### Defining a Virtual Field

Let's add a virtual field called `distance_from_origin` to our `locations` table that calculates the distance from a fixed origin point (e.g., (0, 0)).

```plaintext
import math
from gluon import Field

def calculate_distance(row):
    """Calculates the distance from the origin (0,0)."""
    try:
        lat, lon = row.coordinates #Already a tuple thanks to our custom type
        return math.sqrt(lat**2 + lon**2)
    except (TypeError, AttributeError): #Handles Null coordinates
        return None

db.locations.distance_from_origin = Field.Virtual(calculate_distance) # Assign the function

#Example call to the database to demonstrate its usage.
rows = db(db.locations).select(db.locations.ALL, db.locations.distance_from_origin)
for row in rows:
    print(f"Location: {row.name}, Distance: {row.distance_from_origin}")

```

**Explanation:**

- **`calculate_distance(row)`:** This function takes a row from the `locations` table as input and calculates the distance based on the `coordinates` field (latitude and longitude).
- **`db.locations.distance_from_origin = Field.Virtual(calculate_distance)`:** This line creates a virtual field named `distance_from_origin` and assigns the `calculate_distance` function to it.

**How to use:**

When querying the database, you can select the virtual field like any other field:

```plaintext
rows = db(db.locations).select(db.locations.ALL, db.locations.distance_from_origin)

for row in rows:
    print(f"Location: {row.name}, Distance: {row.distance_from_origin}")
```

The `distance_from_origin` will be calculated on the fly for each row in the result set. You can also filter and order by virtual fields in many cases, depending on the underlying database adapter.

### Considerations for Virtual Fields

- **Performance:** Virtual fields are calculated for each row, so complex calculations can impact performance. Consider caching the results if necessary.
- **Database-Specific Limitations:** Some database adapters may have limitations on using virtual fields in complex queries (e.g., joins, aggregations).
- **Alternatives:** If a calculation is frequently used, consider creating a stored procedure or a materialized view in the database for better performance.

## 3. Extending Database Adapters

While less common, you can also extend the built-in database adapters to handle specific database features or optimize query generation. This requires a deeper understanding of the DAL internals.

**Warning:** Modifying database adapters can introduce compatibility issues or break existing functionality. Proceed with caution and thoroughly test your changes.

### Creating a Custom Database Adapter (Example - Hypothetical Feature)

Let's imagine you want to add support for a hypothetical database feature that allows you to retrieve the first N rows of a query with a single function call (e.g., `LIMIT_FIRST(N)`).

```plaintext
from gluon.dal import SQLite
from gluon import SQLFORM
#Define the custom adapter extending one of the standard ones
class CustomSQLite(SQLite):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomSQLite, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.drivers = ('sqlite3',) #Keep the same drivers
        self.first_n_syntax = 'LIMIT FIRST %s' #Example syntax

    def select(self, fields, attributes, limitby=None, orderby=None, groupby=None, having=None, for_update=False, distinct=False, left=None, cache=None, join_type='INNER', with_recursive=False, **kwargs):
        """Overrides the select method to add support for `LIMIT_FIRST`."""
        if 'LIMIT_FIRST' in attributes and attributes['LIMIT_FIRST'] is not None:
            limit_value = int(attributes['LIMIT_FIRST']) #Gets value from attribute
            if limitby is None:
                limitby = (0, limit_value)
            elif limitby[1] > limit_value:
               limitby = (limitby[0], limit_value)
        return super(CustomSQLite, self).select(fields, attributes, limitby=limitby, orderby=orderby, groupby=groupby, having=having, for_update=for_update, distinct=distinct, left=left, cache=cache, join_type=join_type, with_recursive=with_recursive, **kwargs)


# Use the custom adapter to define the DB connection
db = DAL('sqlite://storage.db', adapter=CustomSQLite) #Use the CustomSQLITE adapter

db.define_table('items',
    Field('name'),
    Field('price', 'double')
)

#Create some items
db.items.insert(name='Item 1', price=10.00)
db.items.insert(name='Item 2', price=20.00)
db.items.insert(name='Item 3', price=30.00)
db.items.insert(name='Item 4', price=40.00)

# Example Usage
#This would retrieve the FIRST 2 items from the database using the custom `LIMIT_FIRST` attribute
rows = db(db.items).select(LIMIT_FIRST=2)

for row in rows:
    print(row.name)

# Output:
# Item 1
# Item 2

#Standard usage still works fine too
rows = db(db.items).select(limitby=(0, 2))
for row in rows:
    print(row.name)

# Output:
# Item 1
# Item 2

def insert_item():
  form = SQLFORM(db.items)
  if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = 'Record inserted!'
  return dict(form=form)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`CustomSQLite(SQLite)`:** We inherit from the `SQLite` adapter (or any other adapter you want to customize).
- **`__init__`:** Initializes the adapter, potentially adding custom attributes or settings. Here it defines `self.first_n_syntax` as an example, though it is not used.
- **`select` (Override):** We override the `select` method to modify how queries are generated. In this case, we check for a custom attribute `LIMIT_FIRST` in the `attributes` dictionary passed to the function. If it exists, we will modify the existing `limitby` parameter to enforce the given limit.

**Important considerations:**

- **Database-Specific Syntax:** Custom adapters often need to handle database-specific SQL syntax and data types.
- **Testing:** Thorough testing is crucial to ensure your custom adapter works correctly and doesn't introduce regressions. Create comprehensive unit tests to cover all scenarios.
- **DAL Internals:** Understanding the DAL's internal query generation process is essential for creating effective database adapters.
- **Maintainability:** Keep your custom adapter as simple and well-documented as possible to facilitate maintenance and future updates.

### Alternatives to Extending Adapters

Before resorting to extending database adapters, consider these alternatives:

- **Stored Procedures:** Encapsulate complex database logic in stored procedures and call them from Web2py.
- **Raw SQL:** Use `db.executesql()` to execute raw SQL queries when you need fine-grained control over the query. Be careful about SQL injection when using raw SQL.
- **Post-Processing:** Retrieve the data using the DAL and then perform post-processing in Python to achieve the desired results.

## Conclusion

Extending Web2py's DAL provides powerful capabilities for customizing database interactions to fit your application's specific needs. Custom data types allow you to handle specialized data formats, virtual fields enable dynamic calculations, and custom database adapters provide fine-grained control over query generation. Remember to carefully consider the trade-offs and potential risks before implementing these extensions. Always prioritize code clarity, maintainability, and thorough testing. With careful planning and execution, you can leverage the extensibility of the DAL to build robust and efficient web applications.
