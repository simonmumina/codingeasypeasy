# Best Nuxt 3 Starter Templates: Speed Up Your Development in 2025

Nuxt 3, the meta-framework for Vue.js, is a game-changer for building performant and scalable web applications. Its server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes make it a powerful choice for developers. However, starting a new Nuxt 3 project from scratch can be time-consuming. That's where starter templates come in! These pre-configured boilerplates provide a foundation, saving you valuable development time and letting you focus on building the core features of your application.

In this article, we'll explore some of the best Nuxt 3 starter templates available in 2025, covering a range of use cases and technologies.

## Why Use a Nuxt 3 Starter Template?

Before we dive into specific templates, let's understand the benefits of using one:

- **Speed Up Development:** Pre-configured setups with essential libraries and configurations save hours of initial setup.
- **Best Practices:** Many templates are built with best practices in mind, incorporating features like linting, formatting, and optimized folder structures.
- **Learn by Example:** Explore how experienced developers structure their Nuxt 3 projects.
- **Consistent Codebase:** Ensure consistency across your team by using a shared starter template.
- **Specific Use Cases:** Find templates tailored to specific needs like e-commerce, blogs, or landing pages.

## Key Features to Consider in a Nuxt 3 Starter Template

When choosing a starter template, consider the following aspects:

- **Technology Stack:** Does it include the technologies you plan to use, like Tailwind CSS, Vuetify, or a specific CMS?

- **Dependencies:** Are the dependencies up-to-date and secure?

## Top Nuxt 3 Starter Templates in 2025

Here's a curated list of some of the best Nuxt 3 starter templates, categorized by their primary focus:

### 1. Nuxt 3 Starter with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework. A starter template with Tailwind CSS pre-configured can significantly speed up your UI development.

**Example:**

```bash
npx nuxi init my-tailwind-app
cd my-tailwind-app
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then configure `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './components/**/*.{js,vue,ts}',
    './layouts/**/*.vue',
    './pages/**/*.vue',
    './plugins/**/*.{js,ts}',
    './nuxt.config.{js,ts}',
    './app.vue',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Finally, import tailwind base styles in `/assets/css/main.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And import the CSS in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
// https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ['~/assets/css/main.css'],
  postcss: {
    plugins: {
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    },
  },
})
```

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ article.fields.title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ article.fields.body }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { createClient } from 'contentful';

const client = createClient({
  space: 'YOUR_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID',
  accessToken: 'YOUR_CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN'
});

const article = ref(null);

onMounted(async () => {
  const entry = await client.getEntry('YOUR_CONTENTFUL_ENTRY_ID');

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
    <img :src="imageUrl(post.mainImage).width(800).url()" alt="Post Image" />
    <p>{{ post.body }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { createClient } from '@sanity/client';
import imageUrlBuilder from '@sanity/image-url';

const client = createClient({
  projectId: 'YOUR_SANITY_PROJECT_ID',
  dataset: 'production', // or 'staging' etc.
  apiVersion: '2023-01-01', // use a UTC date string
  useCdn: true, // `false` if you want to ensure fresh data
});

const builder = imageUrlBuilder(client);

function imageUrl(source) {
  return builder.image(source);
}

const post = ref(null);

onMounted(async () => {
  const query = `*[_type == "post" && slug.current == "your-post-slug"][0]`;
  const data = await client.fetch(query);

Install the `@nuxt/content` module:

```bash
npm install @nuxt/content
```

Configure `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
// https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxt/content'],
  content: {
    // https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration
  },
})
```

Create a `content` directory in your project root. Add Markdown files within this directory (e.g., `content/my-first-post.md`).

**Rendering Markdown Content (in a Nuxt component):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ article.title }}</h1>
    <nuxt-content :document="article" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const { data: article } = await useAsyncData('content', () =>
  queryContent('my-first-post').findOne()
);
</script>
```

### 5. Nuxt 3 Starter with Authentication (Auth.js/NextAuth.js)

Implementing authentication can be complex. A starter template with authentication pre-configured can save you a significant amount of time and effort.

**Example (Conceptual using `next-auth` module (currently in RFC for Nuxt)):**

_The Nuxt version of `next-auth` is still evolving, so the exact implementation might change. This is a conceptual example:_

```bash
npm install next-auth @sidebase/nuxt-auth
```

Configure `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
// https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@sidebase/nuxt-auth'],
  auth: {
    baseURL: process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_ORIGIN,
    provider: {
      type: 'authjs',
    },
  },
})
```

And within a component:

```plaintext
<template>
  <div v-if="!loggedIn">
    <button @click="signIn()">Sign In</button>
  </div>
  <div v-else>
    <p>Welcome, {{ user?.name }}!</p>
    <button @click="signOut()">Sign Out</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
  import { useAuth } from "@sidebase/nuxt-auth"

  const { signIn, signOut, user, loggedIn } = useAuth()
</script>
```

**Key Features of an Authentication Starter:**

- Auth.js (NextAuth.js) pre-configured.

- Improved code readability.
- Enhanced code maintainability.
- Better tooling support.

Most modern Nuxt 3 templates default to TypeScript. Verify that your `nuxt.config.ts` file has proper TypeScript configurations.

**Key Features of a TypeScript Nuxt 3 Starter:**

- TypeScript configured and ready to use.
- Type definitions for common libraries.
- ESLint and Prettier configured for TypeScript code.

**Netlify Configuration (example in `nuxt.config.ts` for serverless functions):**

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    preset: 'netlify',
  },
})
```

**Vercel Configuration (example in `nuxt.config.ts` for serverless functions):**
