# Build a Modern Web App with Python: Reflex and Neon Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build a modern, full-stack web application entirely with Python. We'll be using **Reflex**, a framework that allows you to build interactive web apps with nothing but Python, and **Neon**, a fully managed serverless Postgres database. This combination allows for rapid development, scalability, and a unified language experience, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Why Reflex and Neon?

- **Reflex:** Allows you to write both the frontend and backend of your application in Python. No need to switch languages or deal with complex Javascript frameworks. It uses a declarative component-based approach similar to React, making it easy to build complex UIs. It handles state management, routing, and deployment.

- **Neon:** Provides a serverless Postgres database that scales automatically based on your application's needs. You only pay for what you use, and it offers features like branching and point-in-time recovery, making it ideal for development and production environments. Neon's serverless nature reduces the operational overhead associated with managing traditional databases.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+:** Python is the foundation of our application.
- **Poetry (optional):** For managing dependencies and creating a virtual environment. If you prefer pip, that works too!
- **Node.js (for Reflex):** Reflex relies on some Node.js tools during development, but you won't need to write any JavaScript.
- **A Neon account:** Sign up for a free Neon account at [https://neon.tech/](https://neon.tech/).

## Setting Up Your Project

Let's start by creating a new project directory:

```plaintext
mkdir reflex-neon-app
cd reflex-neon-app
```

Next, create a virtual environment (if using Poetry):

```plaintext
poetry new .
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Or using `venv` and `pip`:

```plaintext
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
```

## Installing Reflex

Now, install the `reflex` library:

```plaintext
pip install reflex
```

## Creating a Reflex App

Initialize a new Reflex project:

```plaintext
reflex init
```

This will create a directory structure with the following files:

- `rxconfig.py`: Configuration file for your Reflex app.
- `{your_app_name}/__init__.py`: Application logic and UI definition.
- `assets/`: Directory for static assets like images and CSS.

## Defining the UI and App Logic

Let's create a simple counter application. Open the file `reflex_neon_app/__init__.py` (or whatever you named your app during `reflex init`) and modify it to look like this:

```plaintext
import reflex as rx

class State(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

    def decrement(self):
        self.count -= 1


def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(State.count),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Decrement", color_scheme="red", on_click=State.decrement),
            rx.button("Increment", color_scheme="green", on_click=State.increment),
        ),
    )


app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index)
app.compile()
```

This code defines:

- **`State`:** A class that holds the application's state (in this case, a counter).
  - `count`: An integer variable representing the current count.
  - `increment()`: A method to increment the count.
  - `decrement()`: A method to decrement the count.
- **`index()`:** A function that defines the UI using Reflex components.
  - `rx.vstack()`: A vertical stack to arrange the UI elements.
  - `rx.heading()`: Displays the current count using data binding ( `State.count`).
  - `rx.hstack()`: A horizontal stack to arrange the buttons.
  - `rx.button()`: Two buttons, one for incrementing and one for decrementing the counter. The `on_click` event is bound to the `increment` and `decrement` methods in the `State` class.
- **`app`:** An instance of the Reflex application.
- `app.add_page(index)`: Registers the `index` function as the main page.
- `app.compile()`: Compiles the app.

## Running the App

Start the development server:

```plaintext
reflex run
```

This will open your application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a page with a heading showing the count (initially 0) and two buttons, "Decrement" and "Increment." Clicking the buttons will update the count in real-time.

## Setting up Neon

1.  **Create a Neon Project:** Log in to your Neon account and create a new project. Neon will automatically provide you with a Postgres database.
2.  **Get Connection String:** In the Neon dashboard, find the connection string for your database. It will look something like:
    ```
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[host]/[database]?options=sslmode%3Drequire
    ```
    **Important:** Store this connection string securely, as it grants access to your database. Consider using environment variables for production environments.

## Connecting Reflex to Neon

Now, let's modify our application to connect to the Neon database. We'll use the `psycopg2` library to interact with Postgres.

```plaintext
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

Update your `reflex_neon_app/__init__.py` file with the following code (replace `YOUR_NEON_DATABASE_URL` with your actual Neon connection string):

```plaintext
import reflex as rx
import psycopg2
import os  # Import the os module

# Get the database URL from an environment variable or hardcode it (NOT recommended for production)
DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "YOUR_NEON_DATABASE_URL")

class State(rx.State):
    count: int = 0

    def increment(self):
        try:
            conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
            cur = conn.cursor()
            cur.execute("UPDATE counter SET value = value + 1;")
            conn.commit()
            cur.execute("SELECT value FROM counter;")
            result = cur.fetchone()
            self.count = result[0] if result else 0 # Ensure result[0] exists
            cur.close()
            conn.close()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error incrementing count: {e}")


    def decrement(self):
        try:
            conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
            cur = conn.cursor()
            cur.execute("UPDATE counter SET value = value - 1;")
            conn.commit()
            cur.execute("SELECT value FROM counter;")
            result = cur.fetchone()
            self.count = result[0] if result else 0 # Ensure result[0] exists
            cur.close()
            conn.close()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error decrementing count: {e}")


    @rx.var
    def initial_count(self) -> int:
        try:
            conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
            cur = conn.cursor()
            cur.execute("SELECT value FROM counter;")
            result = cur.fetchone()
            initial_value = result[0] if result else 0 # Ensure result[0] exists
            cur.close()
            conn.close()
            return initial_value
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error getting initial count: {e}")
            return 0

    def on_load(self):
       # Set the initial count when the page loads
       self.count = self.initial_count


def index():
    return rx.vstack(
        rx.heading(State.count),
        rx.hstack(
            rx.button("Decrement", color_scheme="red", on_click=State.decrement),
            rx.button("Increment", color_scheme="green", on_click=State.increment),
        ),
    )


app = rx.App()
app.add_page(index, on_load=State.on_load)  # Add on_load event
app.compile()

```

**Before running this code, you'll need to create a `counter` table in your Neon database:**

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE counter (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    value INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO counter (value) VALUES (0);
```

**Explanation of changes:**

- **`DATABASE_URL`:** We've added a `DATABASE_URL` variable to store the connection string. **Crucially, it's best practice to get this from an environment variable** to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your code. The code now uses `os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "YOUR_NEON_DATABASE_URL")` which will attempt to read it from the environment, and if that fails, it'll fall back to a placeholder string. **Replace the placeholder with your actual Neon URL for testing, but set the environment variable for real deployments.**
- **Database Interaction:** The `increment()` and `decrement()` methods now connect to the Neon database using `psycopg2`, execute SQL queries to update the `counter` table, and retrieve the updated count. Error handling is included to catch potential database connection issues.
- **Initial Value:** We added an `initial_count` `@rx.var` to fetch the initial value from the database. This is a reactive var, so when you read the initial count from the database, Reflex will keep track of this value.
- **`on_load` event:** We've added an `on_load` event to the page, which calls the `State.on_load` method when the page is first loaded. This ensures that the counter is initialized with the value from the database. The `on_load` method then sets the `State.count` to this initial value.
- **`result[0] if result else 0`:** This adds a null check in case `result` is `None` (e.g., if the `counter` table is empty) to prevent an `IndexError`. This sets the count to `0` if the database query fails.

## Running the App with Database Connection

Now, run your Reflex app again:

```plaintext
reflex run
```

If you are using environment variables, make sure to set the `DATABASE_URL` before running the command:

```plaintext
export DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url" # replace with your neon database URL
reflex run
```

This time, the counter value will be persisted in the Neon database. Incrementing and decrementing the counter will update the database, and the changes will be reflected in the UI. If you refresh the page, the counter will retain its last value.

## Deployment Considerations

- **Environment Variables:** Always use environment variables for sensitive information like database connection strings. This avoids hardcoding credentials in your code and makes it easier to manage your application in different environments.

- **Reflex Deployment:** Reflex provides built-in deployment capabilities. Refer to the Reflex documentation for details on deploying to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, and Docker.

- **Neon Scalability:** Neon's serverless architecture automatically scales your database based on your application's needs. You can further optimize performance by using connection pooling and appropriate database indexing.

- **Security:** Implement proper security measures, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization, to protect your application from vulnerabilities. Neon offers security features like network policies and data encryption.
