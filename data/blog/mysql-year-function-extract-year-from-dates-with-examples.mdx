# MySQL YEAR() Function: Extract Year from Dates with Examples

The MySQL `YEAR()` function is a powerful tool for extracting the year portion from date or datetime values stored in your database.  Whether you need to analyze yearly trends, filter data based on specific years, or perform date-related calculations, understanding how to use the `YEAR()` function is crucial. This comprehensive guide provides a detailed explanation of the function's syntax, usage, and practical examples.

## What is the MySQL YEAR() Function?

The `YEAR()` function in MySQL accepts a date or datetime expression as input and returns the year as an integer. It's a fundamental function for working with date data in your SQL queries.

## Syntax

The syntax for the `YEAR()` function is straightforward:

```sql
YEAR(date)
```

Where `date` can be:

*   **A date or datetime value:**  e.g., `'2023-12-25'`, `'2024-01-15 10:30:00'`
*   **A column in a table containing date or datetime values:** e.g., `order_date`, `registration_date`
*   **An expression that evaluates to a date or datetime value:** e.g.,  `CURDATE()`, `NOW()`

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some examples of how to use the `YEAR()` function:

**1. Extracting the Year from a Date String:**

```sql
SELECT YEAR('2023-05-10');
-- Output: 2023
```

This simple query extracts the year 2023 from the date string '2023-05-10'.

**2. Extracting the Year from a Datetime Value:**

```sql
SELECT YEAR('2024-02-29 14:45:00');
-- Output: 2024
```

The `YEAR()` function works equally well with datetime values, correctly extracting the year 2024.

**3. Using YEAR() with a Column in a Table:**

Suppose you have a table named `orders` with a column named `order_date` of type `DATE` or `DATETIME`. You can use `YEAR()` to retrieve the year of each order.

```sql
-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO orders (order_date, customer_id, amount) VALUES
('2023-01-15', 1, 100.00),
('2023-05-20', 2, 250.50),
('2024-03-10', 1, 150.75),
('2024-08-05', 3, 300.00),
('2024-11-22', 2, 200.25);

SELECT order_id, YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, customer_id, amount
FROM orders;
```

This query will return a result set similar to this:

| order\_id | order\_year | customer\_id | amount |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----- |
| 1         | 2023        | 1            | 100.00 |
| 2         | 2023        | 2            | 250.50 |
| 3         | 2024        | 1            | 150.75 |
| 4         | 2024        | 3            | 300.00 |
| 5         | 2024        | 2            | 200.25 |

The `order_year` column now contains the year extracted from the `order_date` column.

**4. Filtering Data by Year:**

You can use `YEAR()` in the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on the year:

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date, customer_id, amount
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024;
```

This query will retrieve all orders placed in the year 2024.

**5. Grouping Data by Year:**

The `YEAR()` function is often used with the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate data by year:

```sql
SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date)
ORDER BY YEAR(order_date);
```

This query will calculate the total sales for each year and display the results in ascending order of year.  The output would be similar to:

| order\_year | total\_sales |
| :---------- | :------------- |
| 2023        | 350.50       |
| 2024        | 651.00       |

**6. Using YEAR() with `CURDATE()` and `NOW()`:**

`CURDATE()` returns the current date, while `NOW()` returns the current date and time.  You can use `YEAR()` to get the current year:

```sql
SELECT YEAR(CURDATE()); -- Returns the current year as of the date
SELECT YEAR(NOW());     -- Returns the current year as of the date and time
```

**7.  Combining YEAR() with other date functions:**

The YEAR() function is often combined with other date functions to perform complex date calculations. For instance, finding all orders placed in the first quarter of a specific year:

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024 AND QUARTER(order_date) = 1;
```

This query retrieves orders placed in the first quarter (January, February, March) of 2024.

## Important Considerations

*   **Data Types:**  The `YEAR()` function expects a date or datetime value as input.  If you pass a string that cannot be interpreted as a date, MySQL may return an error or unexpected results.  It's best practice to store dates and datetimes in appropriate data types like `DATE`, `DATETIME`, or `TIMESTAMP`.
*   **Null Values:** If the input date is `NULL`, the `YEAR()` function will return `NULL`.
*   **Date Formats:** MySQL is flexible with date formats, but it's recommended to use the standard `YYYY-MM-DD` format to avoid ambiguity.
*   **Time Zones:**  Be mindful of time zones if your database stores datetimes in different time zones.  Consider using functions like `CONVERT_TZ()` to normalize time zones before extracting the year.

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common scenarios where the `YEAR()` function proves useful:

*   **Reporting:** Generating reports that summarize data by year (e.g., annual sales reports).
*   **Data Analysis:** Identifying trends and patterns over time.
*   **Data Filtering:** Selecting data within a specific year range.
*   **Archiving:**  Partitioning or archiving data based on the year.
*   **Aging Analysis:** Calculating the age of records based on the year.

## Conclusion

The MySQL `YEAR()` function is an essential tool for working with date and datetime values.  By understanding its syntax, examples, and use cases, you can effectively extract the year portion of dates and leverage it for various data manipulation tasks.  Remember to consider data types, null values, and time zones when working with dates in your SQL queries. This comprehensive guide provides a strong foundation for using the `YEAR()` function in your MySQL projects.
