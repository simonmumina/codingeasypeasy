## Methods for Checking Hadoop Cluster Status

There are several methods for checking the status of a Hadoop cluster, each offering different levels of detail and accessibility:

1.  **Hadoop Command-Line Tools:** These tools provide direct access to cluster information and are ideal for scripting and automation.
2.  **Hadoop Web UIs:** The web UIs offer a user-friendly graphical interface for monitoring cluster components and jobs.
3.  **Hadoop APIs:** The APIs allow programmatic access to cluster status information, enabling integration with custom monitoring tools and dashboards.
4.  **Third-Party Monitoring Tools:** Tools like Ambari, Cloudera Manager, and others provide comprehensive cluster management and monitoring capabilities.

Let's explore each of these methods in detail.

## 1. Hadoop Command-Line Tools

The Hadoop command-line tools are your primary interface for interacting with the cluster.  Here are some essential commands for checking cluster status:

### 1.1 HDFS Commands

These commands are used to monitor the health and status of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

*   **`hdfs dfsadmin -report`**: This command provides a comprehensive report about the HDFS cluster, including:

    *   **Live Datanodes:** Lists the datanodes that are currently active and connected to the namenode.
    *   **Dead Datanodes:** Lists the datanodes that are currently inactive.  Troubleshooting is needed if datanodes appear in this list.
    *   **Under-replicated Blocks:** Indicates the number of blocks that do not meet the configured replication factor.  This can indicate datanode failures or other issues.
    *   **Missing Blocks:** Indicates the number of blocks that are entirely missing. This is a critical issue and requires immediate attention.
    *   **Corrupt Blocks:**  Indicates the number of blocks that have been identified as corrupt.  Hadoop will attempt to recover these blocks if possible.
    *   **Capacity Information:** Displays the total capacity, used space, and remaining space on the HDFS cluster.

    ```bash
    hdfs dfsadmin -report
    ```

    **Example Output Snippet:**

    ```
    Configured Capacity: 274877906944 (256.00 GB)
    Present Capacity: 241591914496 (224.99 GB)
    DFS Remaining: 182411776000 (169.88 GB)
    DFS Used: 59180138496 (55.11 GB)
    DFS Used%: 24.50%
    Live Datanodes: 3
    Dead Datanodes: 0
    Decommissioning Nodes: 0
    Under replicated blocks: 0
    ```

*   **`hdfs dfsadmin -fsck /`**: This command runs a file system check on the entire HDFS filesystem, reporting on the health of each file and directory.

    ```bash
    hdfs dfsadmin -fsck /
    ```

    You can also specify a path to check only a portion of the filesystem:

    ```bash
    hdfs dfsadmin -fsck /user/hadoop
    ```

*   **Applications:** A list of all running and completed applications, their status, and resource usage.
*   **Nodes:** A list of all node managers in the cluster, their status, and resource utilization.
*   **Queues:**  Information about YARN queues, including resource allocation and usage.
*   **Scheduler Load:** Displays the scheduler load information and details about available and allocated containers.

### 2.3 Job History Server Web UI

The Job History Server Web UI, usually accessible on port `19888` (e.g., `http://job-history-server:19888`), provides historical information about completed MapReduce jobs, including:

*   **Job Details:**  Configuration, counters, and tasks for each job.
*   **Task Logs:**  Logs from individual tasks, useful for debugging.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Execution time, CPU usage, and memory usage for each job.

## 3. Hadoop APIs

Hadoop provides REST APIs that allow you to programmatically access cluster status information. These APIs can be used to integrate Hadoop monitoring with custom tools and dashboards.

### 3.1 HDFS Namenode REST API

The Namenode REST API allows you to retrieve information about the HDFS file system. For example, to get the cluster status, you can use the following API endpoint:

```
http://namenode:50070/jmx?qry=Hadoop:service=NameNode,name=FSNamesystemState
```

This endpoint returns a JSON document containing information about the cluster's capacity, used space, and number of live and dead datanodes.

You can use tools like `curl` or `wget` to access the API:

```bash
curl "http://namenode:50070/jmx?qry=Hadoop:service=NameNode,name=FSNamesystemState"
```

### 3.2 YARN Resource Manager REST API

The Resource Manager REST API allows you to retrieve information about the YARN cluster. For example, to get a list of all applications, you can use the following API endpoint:

```
http://resource-manager:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps
```

This endpoint returns a JSON document containing a list of all applications, their status, and resource usage.

You can also retrieve information about a specific application by using the application ID:

```
http://resource-manager:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps/<application_id>
```
