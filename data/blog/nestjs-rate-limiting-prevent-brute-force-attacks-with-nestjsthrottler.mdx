# NestJS Rate Limiting: Prevent Brute Force Attacks with @nestjs/throttler

In today's digital landscape, securing your APIs against malicious attacks is paramount. One common threat is the **brute force attack**, where attackers repeatedly attempt to guess passwords or bypass security measures by submitting numerous requests in a short period.  **Rate limiting** is a crucial defense mechanism against such attacks.  By limiting the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific timeframe, you can significantly reduce the risk of a successful brute force attempt.

This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to implement rate limiting in your NestJS applications using the `@nestjs/throttler` module.  We'll cover everything from installation and configuration to customization and best practices, ensuring you can effectively protect your API from abuse.

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting, also known as throttling, is a technique used to control the rate of requests an API receives. It involves setting limits on the number of requests a user, IP address, or other identifier can make within a specific time window.  If a client exceeds the allowed rate, subsequent requests are typically rejected with a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

By implementing rate limiting, you can:

*   **Prevent Brute Force Attacks:**  Limit the number of login attempts or sensitive API calls, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess credentials or exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Protect Against DDoS Attacks:**  Mitigate the impact of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by limiting the rate of requests from specific IP addresses or regions.
*   **Conserve Server Resources:**  Prevent excessive API calls from overwhelming your server infrastructure, ensuring optimal performance and stability.
*   **Enforce Usage Quotas:**  Control API usage for different user tiers or subscription plans.
*   **Improve API Availability:**  Prevent abuse from disrupting service for legitimate users.

## Introducing @nestjs/throttler

`@nestjs/throttler` is a powerful and flexible module that provides rate limiting functionality for NestJS applications.  It leverages the `rate-limiter-flexible` package under the hood, offering a wide range of options for customizing the rate limiting behavior.

**Key Features:**

*   **Easy Integration:**  Seamlessly integrates with your NestJS application through decorators and module configurations.
*   **Configurable Options:**  Customize the rate limit duration, maximum requests allowed, storage backend, and more.
*   **IP-Based and User-Based Rate Limiting:**  Limit requests based on IP address, user ID, or other identifiers.
*   **Exception Handling:**  Provides a `ThrottlerException` that you can handle to customize the error response.
*   **Flexible Storage Backends:**  Supports various storage backends, including memory, Redis, Memcached, and more.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:**  Allows you to configure rate limits based on environment variables or runtime conditions.
*   **Global and Route-Specific Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limits globally to your entire application or to specific routes.

## Installation

To get started, install the `@nestjs/throttler` module using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install --save @nestjs/throttler
# or
yarn add @nestjs/throttler
```

## Configuration

Next, import the `ThrottlerModule` and configure it in your `AppModule` (or another relevant module).

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ThrottlerModule } from '@nestjs/throttler';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ThrottlerModule.forRoot({
      ttl: 60, // seconds
      limit: 10, // requests per ttl
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`ThrottlerModule.forRoot({...})`**:  Configures the global rate limiting settings.
*   **`ttl` (Time-To-Live):** Specifies the duration (in seconds) for which the rate limit applies.  In this example, the rate limit is applied for 60 seconds.
*   **`limit`:**  Specifies the maximum number of requests allowed within the `ttl` duration. In this example, 10 requests are allowed per minute.

**Important Configuration Options:**

*   **`skipIf`:**  A function that returns `true` if the rate limiting should be skipped for a particular request.  Useful for excluding specific routes or user roles from rate limiting.

    ```typescript
    ThrottlerModule.forRoot({
      ttl: 60,
      limit: 10,
      skipIf: (context: ExecutionContext) => {
        // Skip rate limiting for admin users
        const req = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
        return req.user?.role === 'admin';
      },
    }),
    ```

*   **`ignoreUserAgents`:**  An array of regular expressions to match against user agents.  Requests from matching user agents will not be rate limited.  Useful for whitelisting bots or monitoring tools.

    ```typescript
    ThrottlerModule.forRoot({
      ttl: 60,
      limit: 10,
      ignoreUserAgents: [/Googlebot/], // Ignore requests from Googlebot
    }),
    ```

*   **`storage`:** Allows you to configure a different storage adapter for the rate limiter. The default is `InMemoryStore`, which is suitable for small applications. For production environments, consider using Redis or Memcached for better scalability and persistence.  See the [Storage Options](#storage-options) section for more details.

    ```typescript
    import { ThrottlerModule, ThrottlerStorageRedisService } from '@nestjs/throttler';
    import { CacheModule } from '@nestjs/cache-manager';
    import * as redisStore from 'cache-manager-redis-store';

    @Module({
      imports: [
        CacheModule.registerAsync({
          useFactory: async () => ({
            store: redisStore,
            host: 'localhost',
            port: 6379,
          }),
        }),
        ThrottlerModule.forRootAsync({
          imports: [CacheModule],
          inject: [CACHE_MANAGER],
          useFactory: (cacheManager: Cache) => ({
            ttl: 60,
            limit: 10,
            storage: new ThrottlerStorageRedisService(cacheManager),
          }),
        }),
      ],
      controllers: [AppController],
      providers: [AppService],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

## Applying Rate Limiting to Controllers and Routes

Now that you have configured the `ThrottlerModule`, you can apply rate limiting to your controllers and routes using the `@Throttle()` decorator.

**Global Rate Limiting (Applying to all routes in the controller):**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ThrottlerGuard, Throttle } from '@nestjs/throttler';

@Controller('api')
@UseGuards(ThrottlerGuard) // Applies rate limiting to all routes in this controller
export class ApiController {
  @Get('data')
  getData(): string {
    return 'This is some protected data.';
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@UseGuards(ThrottlerGuard)` decorator applies the global rate limiting settings defined in the `ThrottlerModule` to all routes within the `ApiController`.

**Route-Specific Rate Limiting:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ThrottlerGuard, Throttle } from '@nestjs/throttler';

@Controller('api')
@UseGuards(ThrottlerGuard)
export class ApiController {
  @Get('data')
  getData(): string {
    return 'This is some protected data.';
  }

  @Throttle(2, 30) // Limit to 2 requests every 30 seconds
  @Get('sensitive')
  getSensitiveData(): string {
    return 'This is highly sensitive data.';
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@Throttle(2, 30)` decorator applies a specific rate limit to the `/sensitive` route, allowing only 2 requests every 30 seconds.  This overrides the global rate limiting settings for this specific route.

**Explanation of `@Throttle(limit, ttl)`:**

*   **`limit`:** The maximum number of requests allowed within the specified time window.
*   **`ttl`:** The time window (in seconds) during which the rate limit applies.

## Handling ThrottlerException

When a client exceeds the rate limit, the `@nestjs/throttler` module throws a `ThrottlerException`.  You can catch this exception using NestJS's exception filters to customize the error response.

```typescript
import { Catch, ArgumentsHost, HttpException, HttpStatus } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/core';
import { ThrottlerException } from '@nestjs/throttler';

@Catch(ThrottlerException)
export class ThrottlerExceptionFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: ThrottlerException, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse();
    const status = HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS;

    response.status(status).json({
      statusCode: status,
      message: 'Too many requests. Please try again later.', // Customize your error message
    });
  }
}
```

**Steps to Implement the Exception Filter:**

1.  **Create the Filter:** Create a new class that extends `BaseExceptionFilter` and implements the `catch` method.  In the `catch` method, you can access the request and response objects to customize the error response.
2.  **Register the Filter Globally (Recommended):** In your `main.ts` file (or wherever you bootstrap your NestJS application), register the exception filter globally:

    ```typescript
    import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
    import { AppModule } from './app.module';
    import { ThrottlerExceptionFilter } from './throttler-exception.filter';

    async function bootstrap() {
      const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
      app.useGlobalFilters(new ThrottlerExceptionFilter());
      await app.listen(3000);
    }
    bootstrap();
    ```

   Alternatively, you can apply the filter to specific controllers or routes using the `@UseFilters` decorator.

## Storage Options

The `@nestjs/throttler` module supports various storage backends for storing rate limit information. The default is `InMemoryStore`, which is suitable for small applications and development environments. For production environments, it's strongly recommended to use a more scalable and persistent storage backend such as Redis or Memcached.

**1. InMemoryStore (Default):**

This is the default storage backend and stores rate limit information in memory.  It's simple to use but not suitable for production environments, as the rate limit data is lost when the server restarts.

**2. Redis:**

Redis is a popular in-memory data store that provides excellent performance and scalability.  To use Redis, you need to install the `cache-manager-redis-store` package and configure the `ThrottlerModule` to use the `ThrottlerStorageRedisService`.  See the example in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

**3. Memcached:**

Memcached is another high-performance, distributed memory caching system.  To use Memcached, you'll need to install a compatible caching package (like `cache-manager-memcached-store`) and configure `@nestjs/cache-manager` and then `ThrottlerModule` as you would for Redis.

**Choosing the Right Storage Backend:**

*   **Development/Testing:** `InMemoryStore` is sufficient.
*   **Small Production Applications (Single Instance):**  Consider `InMemoryStore` with caution, understanding data loss on restart.
*   **Production Applications (Multiple Instances/Scalability):**  Redis or Memcached are highly recommended.  Redis is generally preferred due to its versatility and richer feature set.

## Identifying Clients for Rate Limiting

By default, `@nestjs/throttler` uses the client's IP address to identify clients for rate limiting. This is usually sufficient for basic rate limiting scenarios. However, in some cases, you may need to identify clients based on other factors, such as:

*   **User ID:** If your application has authenticated users, you can use the user ID to identify clients for rate limiting. This allows you to apply different rate limits to different users or user groups.
*   **API Key:** If your API requires clients to use an API key, you can use the API key to identify clients for rate limiting.
*   **Custom Identifier:** You can define your own custom identifier based on any request information, such as headers, cookies, or query parameters.

To customize the client identifier, you can override the `generateKey` method of the `ThrottlerGuard`.

```typescript
import { Injectable, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ThrottlerGuard } from '@nestjs/throttler';

@Injectable()
export class CustomThrottlerGuard extends ThrottlerGuard {
  protected generateKey(context: ExecutionContext, suffix: string): string {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const userId = request.user?.id; // Assuming user ID is available in the request
    return `${userId}-${suffix}`; // Unique key based on user ID and route suffix
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extend `ThrottlerGuard`:** Create a new class that extends the `ThrottlerGuard`.
2.  **Override `generateKey`:** Override the `generateKey` method to customize the key generation logic.
3.  **Extract User ID:** In the `generateKey` method, extract the user ID from the request object (assuming your authentication middleware sets it).
4.  **Create Unique Key:** Combine the user ID with the route suffix (provided by the `suffix` parameter) to create a unique key for each user and route.
5.  **Use the Custom Guard:**  Replace `ThrottlerGuard` with `CustomThrottlerGuard` in your controller or route decorators:

    ```typescript
    import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { CustomThrottlerGuard, Throttle } from '@nestjs/throttler';

    @Controller('api')
    @UseGuards(CustomThrottlerGuard)
    export class ApiController {
      @Get('data')
      getData(): string {
        return 'This is some protected data.';
      }

      @Throttle(2, 30)
      @Get('sensitive')
      getSensitiveData(): string {
        return 'This is highly sensitive data.';
      }
    }
    ```

## Best Practices

*   **Choose the Right Rate Limit Values:**  Carefully consider the appropriate rate limit values for your API endpoints.  Set limits that are high enough to accommodate legitimate users but low enough to prevent abuse.  Analyze your API traffic patterns to determine optimal values.

*   **Apply Rate Limiting Strategically:**  Apply rate limiting to sensitive API endpoints, such as login, password reset, and data modification endpoints.  Consider applying different rate limits to different user roles or subscription plans.

*   **Use a Scalable Storage Backend:**  For production environments, use a scalable storage backend such as Redis or Memcached to ensure that rate limiting can handle high traffic loads.

*   **Provide Informative Error Messages:**  Customize the `ThrottlerException` to provide informative error messages to clients.  Include information about the remaining time until the rate limit is reset.

*   **Monitor Rate Limiting Performance:**  Monitor the performance of your rate limiting implementation to identify potential bottlenecks or issues.  Adjust the rate limit values or storage backend as needed.

*   **Implement Whitelisting (with Caution):**  If you need to exclude certain clients from rate limiting (e.g., internal services, trusted partners), implement a whitelisting mechanism.  However, be careful when whitelisting clients, as it can create security vulnerabilities.  Only whitelist trusted clients and ensure that the whitelisting mechanism is properly secured. Use `skipIf` or `ignoreUserAgents` configurations options described above.

*   **Implement Logging:**  Log rate limiting events (e.g., when a client exceeds the rate limit) to help you identify and investigate potential abuse.
