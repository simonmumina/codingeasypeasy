# CI/CD for Gatsby: Automate Your Website Deployment with GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a crucial practice in modern web development. It allows you to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your Gatsby website, saving you time and ensuring consistency. This guide will walk you through setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your Gatsby project using GitHub Actions.

## Why Use CI/CD with Gatsby?

Here's why you should consider using CI/CD for your Gatsby website:

- **Automation:** Automate the build, test, and deployment process, reducing manual effort.
- **Consistency:** Ensure consistent builds and deployments across different environments.
- **Faster Feedback:** Catch errors and issues early in the development cycle.
- **Reduced Risk:** Minimize the risk of deploying broken code to production.
- **Faster Deployments:** Quickly deploy new features and updates to your website.
- **Collaboration:** Enables streamlined collaboration among developers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **A Gatsby Project:** You need an existing Gatsby website project.
- **A GitHub Repository:** Your Gatsby project should be hosted on a GitHub repository.
- **A Hosting Platform:** Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS Amplify, etc.) and have an account set up. We'll use Netlify as the primary example in this guide, but the principles are transferable.
- **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Installed locally for development and testing.

## Step 1: Choose a CI/CD Platform

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform built directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate your workflows using YAML files defined in your repository. Other alternatives include:

- **Netlify CI/CD:** Integrated directly with Netlify.
- **Vercel CI/CD:** Integrated directly with Vercel.
- **CircleCI:** A popular cloud-based CI/CD platform.
- **Travis CI:** Another well-established CI/CD platform.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated into GitLab.

For this guide, we'll use GitHub Actions due to its simplicity and integration with GitHub.

## Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a new file in your Gatsby project at `.github/workflows/gatsby-deploy.yml`. This file will define your CI/CD workflow.

```plaintext
# .github/workflows/gatsby-deploy.yml
name: Gatsby Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger workflow on pushes to the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger workflow on pull requests to the 'main' branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # or your preferred Node.js version
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install # or yarn install

      - name: Run linters and formatters
        run: |
          npm run lint # Run your linting script
          npm run format # Run your formatting script

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test # Run your tests

      - name: Build Gatsby site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: netlify/actions/deploy@v1
        with:
          publishDir: public
          netlifySiteId: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
          netlifyToken: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
          NETLIFY_DEPLOY_MESSAGE: 'Deployed from GitHub Actions: commit ${{ github.sha }}'
```

**Explanation of the Workflow File:**

- **`name: Gatsby Deploy`:** Defines the name of the workflow.
- **`on:`:** Specifies the triggers for the workflow. In this case, it's triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch. You can adjust this to trigger on specific branches or events.
- **`jobs:`:** Defines the jobs that will be executed in the workflow.
- **`build:`:** A job named "build" that runs on an Ubuntu virtual machine.
- **`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`:** Specifies the operating system for the job.
- **`steps:`:** A sequence of steps to be executed within the job.
  - **`actions/checkout@v3`:** Checks out the code from your GitHub repository.
  - **`actions/setup-node@v3`:** Sets up Node.js with a specified version and caches dependencies for faster builds.
  - **`npm install`:** Installs the project dependencies.
  - **`npm run lint` (optional):** Runs linting scripts to check for code quality issues. Make sure your `package.json` has a script defined for linting (e.g., `"lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx"`).
  - **`npm run format` (optional):** Runs formatting scripts to automatically format your code. Make sure your `package.json` has a script defined for formatting (e.g., `"format": "prettier --write ."`).
  - **`npm test` (optional):** Runs your tests. Make sure your `package.json` has a script defined for testing (e.g., `"test": "jest"`).
  - **`npm run build`:** Builds your Gatsby site using the `gatsby build` command (defined in your `package.json`).
  - **`netlify/actions/deploy@v1`:** Deploys the built website to Netlify.
    - **`publishDir: public`:** Specifies the directory containing the built website files. Gatsby typically outputs to the `public` directory.
    - **`netlifySiteId: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}`:** The ID of your Netlify site. This is stored as a GitHub Secret (see next step).
    - **`netlifyToken: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}`:** Your Netlify personal access token. This is also stored as a GitHub Secret.
-       **`env:`:** defines enviroment variables accessible to the action.  Here we are duplicating the `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` variables so we can use the `NETLIFY_DEPLOY_MESSAGE` variable.  Note that `NETLIFY_DEPLOY_MESSAGE` will be the deploy message displayed in your Netlify deploy logs.

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

To securely store your Netlify API token and site ID, you need to configure GitHub Secrets.

1.  Go to your GitHub repository.
2.  Click on "Settings."
3.  Click on "Secrets and variables" then "Actions."
4.  Click on "New repository secret."
5.  Create the following secrets:
    - **`NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`:** Your Netlify personal access token. To obtain this token, go to your Netlify user settings and create a new access token. Give it a meaningful name (e.g., "GitHub Actions Deploy Token").
    - **`NETLIFY_SITE_ID`:** The ID of your Netlify site. You can find this ID in your Netlify site settings under "Site details."

**Important:** Never commit your Netlify API token or site ID directly to your repository. Use GitHub Secrets to protect sensitive information.

## Step 4: Commit and Push Your Workflow

Commit the `.github/workflows/gatsby-deploy.yml` file to your GitHub repository and push it to the `main` branch.

```plaintext
git add .github/workflows/gatsby-deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add Gatsby CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions"
git push origin main
```

## Step 5: Trigger Your Workflow

Once you push your changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow. You can monitor the progress of the workflow in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

## Step 6: Verify the Deployment

After the workflow completes successfully, verify that your Gatsby website has been deployed to Netlify. Check your Netlify dashboard to see the new deployment and ensure your website is functioning correctly.

## Customizing Your Workflow

The workflow provided above is a basic example. You can customize it to fit your specific needs. Here are some common customizations:

- **Environment Variables:** You can set environment variables for your Gatsby build using the `env` key in the workflow file. This is especially useful for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

  ```plaintext
  # Example of setting environment variables
  - name: Build Gatsby site
    env:
      NODE_ENV: production
    run: npm run build
  ```

- **Caching:** Cache Gatsby's `.cache` and `public` directories to speed up subsequent builds.

  ```plaintext
  - name: Cache Gatsby dependencies
    uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: |
        ./node_modules
        ./.cache
        ./public
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-gatsby-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-gatsby-
  ```

- **Conditional Deployment:** Deploy only on specific branches or based on other conditions.

  ```plaintext
  # Deploy only on the 'main' branch
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  ```

- **Notifications:** Send notifications on workflow failures using services like Slack or Discord. Look for GitHub Actions integrations for your preferred notification service.

- **Deploying to Other Platforms (Vercel, AWS Amplify):** Adapt the deploy step to use the specific deployment actions or CLI tools for your chosen platform. For example, for Vercel, you can use the `vercel/vercel-action@v12` action.

## Deploying to Vercel

Here's an example of how to deploy to Vercel using GitHub Actions:

```plaintext
# .github/workflows/gatsby-deploy-vercel.yml
name: Gatsby Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: vercel/vercel-action@v12
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          scope: your-vercel-scope # Optional
          teamId: your-vercel-team-id # Optional
        env:
          VERCEL_ORG_ID: your-vercel-org-id
          VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: your-vercel-project-id
```

Remember to replace `your-vercel-scope`, `your-vercel-team-id`, `your-vercel-org-id`, and `your-vercel-project-id` with your actual Vercel scope, team ID, organization ID, and project ID. Also, create a GitHub secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` containing your Vercel API token.

## Best Practices

- **Use Environment Variables:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your workflow files. Use environment variables and GitHub Secrets instead.
- **Test Your Workflow:** Before deploying to production, test your workflow on a staging or development environment.
- **Monitor Your Workflow:** Regularly monitor your workflow runs to identify and resolve any issues.
- **Keep Your Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Update your project dependencies regularly to ensure security and performance. Consider using Dependabot to automate dependency updates.
- **Secure your .env File:** If you are using a .env file, be sure to add it to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to your repository. You should never commit your .env file to your repository as it may contain sensitive information. Instead, you should use environment variables within your CI/CD pipeline.

## Conclusion

Setting up CI/CD for your Gatsby website with GitHub Actions is a straightforward process that can significantly improve your development workflow. By automating the build, test, and deployment process, you can save time, reduce errors, and ensure consistent deployments. Experiment with the provided examples and customize your workflow to meet the specific needs of your project. Remember to secure your sensitive information using GitHub Secrets and follow best practices to ensure a reliable and efficient CI/CD pipeline.
