# Expo Router Modals: A Comprehensive Guide to Navigation and Implementation

Expo Router is a powerful routing library for React Native applications built with Expo.  One of its key features is its simplified approach to navigation, including modal presentation.  This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of implementing and customizing modals using Expo Router, enabling you to create a polished and intuitive user experience in your mobile apps.

## Why Use Modals?

Modals, also known as dialogs, are crucial UI elements for:

*   **Focusing User Attention:**  They temporarily block the main app content to highlight important information, confirmations, or tasks.
*   **Presenting Focused Actions:** Modals are ideal for collecting user input, displaying forms, or offering specific options without navigating away from the current screen.
*   **Creating a Polished User Experience:**  When implemented correctly, modals contribute to a smooth and intuitive app flow.

## Setting Up Your Expo Project with Expo Router

Before diving into modals, ensure you have an Expo project set up with Expo Router. If not, create a new project:

```bash
npx create-expo-app -t tabs my-app
cd my-app
npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants
```

This command creates a new Expo project with the "tabs" template which is a standard starting point for Expo Router applications. It also installs necessary dependencies like `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-safe-area-context`, and `react-native-screens`, which are critical for smooth navigation and animations.

## Basic Modal Implementation with Expo Router

Expo Router simplifies modal creation using a file-based routing system.  To create a modal, you simply need to create a file with the `_modal` suffix.

**1. Create a Modal Route:**

In your `app` directory (the heart of your Expo Router navigation), create a file named `app/modal.tsx` (or `app/modal/_layout.tsx` for a shared layout). This file will define the content of your modal.

**2. Modal Content (app/modal.tsx):**

```tsx
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function ModalScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>This is a Modal!</Text>
        <Text style={styles.description}>Here you can display information or gather user input.</Text>
        <Button title="Close Modal" onPress={() => router.back()} />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
  content: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  description: {
    fontSize: 16,
    textAlign: 'center',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   `useRouter()`:  Expo Router's hook for programmatic navigation.
*   `router.back()`:  Closes the modal and navigates back to the previous screen.
*   `SafeAreaView`: Ensures the modal content is not obscured by the device's status bar or notch.
*   Basic styling for a centered modal view.

**3. Triggering the Modal from another screen (app/index.tsx):**

Modify your main screen (`app/index.tsx` or another screen where you want to trigger the modal) to include a button that navigates to the modal route:

```tsx
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { Link, useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Home Screen</Text>
        <Text style={styles.description}>Tap the button below to open the modal.</Text>
        <Button title="Open Modal" onPress={() => router.push('/modal')} />
        {/* Alternatively, using the Link component: */}
        {/* <Link href="/modal" asChild>
          <Button title="Open Modal (Link Component)" />
        </Link> */}
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
  },
  content: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  description: {
    fontSize: 16,
    textAlign: 'center',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   `router.push('/modal')`: This line uses the `push` method to navigate to the `/modal` route, triggering the modal presentation.
*   `Link`:  The `<Link>` component from `expo-router` can also be used for navigation.  The `asChild` prop ensures the `<Button>` component receives the navigation functionality.

**4. Running the App:**

Start your Expo development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Now, when you run your app and tap the "Open Modal" button, the modal will appear.  Tapping the "Close Modal" button will dismiss it and return you to the home screen.

## Customizing Modal Presentation

Expo Router offers several ways to customize the appearance and behavior of your modals.

**1. Using `_layout.tsx` for Shared Modal Layout:**

If you want a consistent appearance and behavior across multiple modals, create a `_layout.tsx` file inside your `app/modal/` directory:

```tsx
// app/modal/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

export default function ModalLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack
      screenOptions={{
        presentation: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'modal' : 'transparentModal', // 'modal' is default on iOS
        headerShown: false, // Hide the header if desired
        animation: 'slide_from_bottom', // Choose your preferred animation
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Stack`:  Expo Router uses a stack navigator behind the scenes.  This component allows you to configure screen options for routes within the directory.
*   `presentation`:  This option controls how the screen is presented.
    *   `modal` (iOS default):  The standard iOS modal presentation style.
    *   `transparentModal` (Android default): A full-screen modal with a transparent background, allowing the underlying screen to be partially visible.
    *  Other options available depending on React Navigation and platform versions. Refer to [React Navigation Screen Options](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/screen-options/) for more details.
*   `headerShown: false`:  Hides the default header on the modal screen.
*   `animation`:  Controls the animation used when the modal is presented or dismissed. Common options include:
    *   `slide_from_bottom`:  The modal slides in from the bottom of the screen.
    *   `slide_from_right`: The modal slides in from the right of the screen.
    *   `fade`: The modal fades in and out.
    *   Refer to React Navigation's documentation for a full list of supported animations.

**2. Passing Data to the Modal:**

You can pass data to the modal using query parameters in the URL:

**From the triggering screen (app/index.tsx):**

```tsx
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const openModalWithData = () => {
    router.push({
      pathname: '/modal',
      params: { message: 'Hello from the Home Screen!' },
    });
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>Home Screen</Text>
        <Text style={styles.description}>Tap the button below to open the modal.</Text>
        <Button title="Open Modal with Data" onPress={openModalWithData} />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

// ... (styles remain the same)
```

**Inside the Modal (app/modal.tsx):**

```tsx
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function ModalScreen() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { message } = useSearchParams<{ message?: string }>();

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <Text style={styles.title}>This is a Modal!</Text>
        {message && <Text style={styles.description}>{message}</Text>}
        <Button title="Close Modal" onPress={() => router.back()} />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

// ... (styles remain the same)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `router.push({ pathname: '/modal', params: { message: '...' } })`:  The `push` method is now passed an object with `pathname` and `params`.  The `params` object contains the data you want to send to the modal.
*   `useSearchParams<{ message?: string }>()`: This hook retrieves the query parameters from the URL.  The type argument `<{ message?: string }>` defines the expected structure of the parameters, providing TypeScript type safety.  The `?` indicates that the `message` parameter is optional.
*   `{message && <Text ...>{message}</Text>}`:  Conditionally renders the message if it exists.

**3.  Creating Custom Animations:**

For advanced animation control, you can leverage `react-native-reanimated` alongside `expo-router`. However, this goes beyond the basic scope and can be complex. You can achieve custom transitions using libraries like `react-native-reanimated`, but it's a more involved process that involves creating animated styles and transitions.  Explore React Navigation's documentation for information on transition specs and animations.

**4.  Full-Screen Modals:**

For full-screen modals that cover the entire screen, you might consider simply using a standard route instead of a modal route (`_modal`). You can still customize the appearance to look and feel like a modal by removing the header and adding a close button. This approach offers more flexibility in layout and content.

## Best Practices for Modal Implementation

*   **Keep Modals Concise:** Avoid overloading modals with too much content.  Focus on presenting essential information or actions.
*   **Provide Clear Dismissal Options:**  Always include a clear and intuitive way to close the modal, such as a "Close" button, a "Cancel" button, or a tap outside the modal area.
*   **Maintain Accessibility:** Ensure your modals are accessible to users with disabilities by using appropriate ARIA attributes and providing keyboard navigation.
*   **Consider Platform Conventions:**  Adhere to platform-specific design guidelines to create a native-feeling experience.  For example, iOS modals often have a sheet-like appearance, while Android modals tend to be full-screen.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your modals on different devices and screen sizes to ensure they render correctly and function as expected.
*   **Use a Layout component:** Wrap all of your modal screen content in a component with safe area context and the correct styling for the platform to avoid overlapping the status bar and notch.
