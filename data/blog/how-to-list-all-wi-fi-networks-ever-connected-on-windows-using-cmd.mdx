# How to List All Wi-Fi Networks Ever Connected on Windows Using CMD

Keeping track of the Wi-Fi networks your computer has connected to can be useful for various reasons, including security audits, troubleshooting connectivity issues, or simply managing your saved network profiles. While Windows offers a graphical interface for managing Wi-Fi networks, using the Command Prompt (CMD) provides a more powerful and efficient way to list **all** networks, even those no longer in range. This guide will walk you through the steps using the `netsh` command-line utility.

## Why Use CMD to List Wi-Fi Networks?

- **Comprehensive List:** CMD can display all saved Wi-Fi profiles, including those that are not currently in range or visible in the Windows Wi-Fi settings.
- **Scripting and Automation:** CMD allows you to automate the process of listing and managing Wi-Fi networks, which can be beneficial for administrators or power users.
- **Detailed Information:** You can retrieve detailed information about each network profile, such as security settings, authentication methods, and connection history.
- **Troubleshooting:** Examining the list of networks and their configurations can help identify potential conflicts or issues causing connectivity problems.

## Prerequisites

- A Windows computer (Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11).
- Administrator privileges (to execute certain commands).

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to list all Wi-Fi networks ever connected to your Windows computer using CMD:

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt as Administrator

1.  **Search:** Type "cmd" in the Windows search bar.
2.  **Right-click:** Right-click on the "Command Prompt" search result.
3.  **Run as administrator:** Select "Run as administrator" from the context menu. Grant the necessary permissions if prompted by User Account Control (UAC). Running CMD as administrator is crucial because some commands require elevated privileges to access network configuration data.

### Step 2: Execute the `netsh wlan show profiles` Command

In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:

```plaintext
netsh wlan show profiles
```

This command uses the `netsh` (Network Shell) utility, specifically the `wlan` (Wireless LAN) context, to display a list of all Wi-Fi profiles saved on your computer. The output will look similar to this:

```
Profiles on interface Wi-Fi:

Group policy profiles (read only)
---------------------------------
    <None>

User profiles
-------------
    All User Profile     : NetworkName1
    All User Profile     : NetworkName2
    All User Profile     : MyHomeWiFi
    All User Profile     : CoffeeShopWiFi
    All User Profile     : PublicWiFi
```

- **`netsh`:** This is the network configuration command-line utility.
- **`wlan`:** Specifies that we are working with the Wireless LAN interface.
- **`show profiles`:** Instructs `netsh` to display the list of Wi-Fi profiles.

The output lists the network names (SSIDs) of all Wi-Fi networks for which your computer has stored a profile. The "All User Profile" designation indicates that these profiles are available to all users on the computer.

### Step 3: (Optional) Retrieve Detailed Information About a Specific Profile

To get detailed information about a specific Wi-Fi network profile, use the following command, replacing `"NetworkName"` with the actual name of the network (SSID) from the list obtained in Step 2:

```plaintext
netsh wlan show profile name="NetworkName" key=clear
```

For example, if you want to see details about the "MyHomeWiFi" network, you would use:

```plaintext
netsh wlan show profile name="MyHomeWiFi" key=clear
```

This command will display extensive information about the network profile, including:

- **Connection settings:** Authentication type, encryption algorithm, and connection mode.
- **Security settings:** Pre-shared key (PSK), if applicable (displayed in clear text because of `key=clear`). **Note:** Be cautious when displaying the key in clear text, especially in a public environment.
- **Cost settings:** Information on whether the network is considered metered.

**Important Security Note:**

The `key=clear` option reveals the Wi-Fi password (PSK) in plain text. Be extremely cautious when using this option, especially if you are in a public place or sharing your screen. Consider omitting this option if you only need other profile details and not the password. Without `key=clear`, the key will be marked as "Present," but the actual password will not be displayed.

### Step 4: (Optional) Exporting Profiles to a File

For backing up or transferring Wi-Fi profiles, you can export them to XML files using the following command:

```plaintext
netsh wlan export profile name="NetworkName" folder="C:\WiFiBackups" key=clear
```

Replace `"NetworkName"` with the name of the Wi-Fi network you want to export and `"C:\WiFiBackups"` with the desired folder to save the XML file. You will need to create the `C:\WiFiBackups` folder beforehand.

This command creates an XML file containing all the configuration information for the specified Wi-Fi profile. You can then import these profiles on another Windows computer using the `netsh wlan add profile` command (omitted here for brevity, but easily searchable).

### Additional `netsh wlan` Commands

Here are some other useful `netsh wlan` commands:

- **`netsh wlan connect name="NetworkName"`:** Connect to a specific Wi-Fi network.
- **`netsh wlan disconnect`:** Disconnect from the current Wi-Fi network.
- **`netsh wlan delete profile name="NetworkName"`:** Delete a Wi-Fi profile. This can be helpful for removing old or problematic profiles.
- **`netsh wlan show networks`:** Lists available Wi-Fi networks in range.
- **`netsh wlan show drivers`:** Displays information about the wireless network adapter drivers.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **"You do not have permission to perform this operation"**: Ensure you are running Command Prompt as an administrator.
- **"The wireless auto config service is not running"**: Make sure the "WLAN AutoConfig" service is enabled and running in Windows Services (search for "services.msc" to access the Services window).
- **Incorrect Network Name:** Double-check the spelling of the network name (SSID) when using the `name=` parameter. Network names are case-sensitive.
- **Profiles Not Appearing:** If you are not seeing the profiles you expect, verify that the Wi-Fi adapter is enabled and functioning correctly. Check Device Manager for any driver issues.
- **Security Concerns with `key=clear`:** Remember the security implications of displaying the password in clear text. Use this option only when absolutely necessary and in a secure environment. Consider alternative methods, such as viewing the password in the Windows GUI (if available).

## Conclusion

Using the Command Prompt (CMD) with the `netsh` utility offers a powerful and efficient way to list, manage, and troubleshoot your Wi-Fi network profiles on Windows. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can gain a deeper understanding of your network configurations and resolve potential connectivity issues effectively. Remember to exercise caution when handling sensitive information like Wi-Fi passwords. Regularly reviewing your saved Wi-Fi profiles can also improve your network security and overall system performance.
