# OAuth2 Social Login with Nuxt: A Comprehensive Guide (Google, Facebook, GitHub)

Social login has become a standard feature in modern web applications, providing users with a quick and convenient way to authenticate using their existing social media accounts. This not only improves the user experience but also reduces friction during the signup process. Nuxt.js, with its flexibility and ease of use, is a great framework for building applications with social login functionality.

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of implementing OAuth2 social login in your Nuxt application, covering Google, Facebook, and GitHub. We'll explore the required configurations, code examples, and best practices to ensure a secure and seamless integration.

## Why Use OAuth2 for Social Login?

OAuth2 (Open Authorization) is an open standard authorization protocol that allows secure delegated access. Instead of asking users for their social media credentials directly (which is a security risk and against the terms of service of most providers), you request authorization to access specific information about the user from the provider. OAuth2 provides several benefits:

- **Security:** Users don't share their passwords with your application.
- **Delegated Access:** You only request the specific permissions you need (e.g., email, profile information).
- **Revocable Access:** Users can revoke access to your application at any time.
- **Standard Protocol:** OAuth2 is a widely adopted standard, ensuring compatibility and security.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm or yarn:** (or pnpm)
- **Nuxt.js:** (This guide assumes Nuxt 3, but the principles apply to Nuxt 2 with some adjustments to syntax and module configurations).

## Setting Up Your Nuxt Project

If you don't already have a Nuxt project, create one using the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi init my-nuxt-social-login-app
cd my-nuxt-social-login-app
```

## Step 1: Obtain API Credentials from Social Providers

To integrate social login, you'll need to register your application with each provider (Google, Facebook, GitHub) and obtain API credentials (client ID and client secret).

### Google

1.  **Go to the Google Cloud Console:** [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2.  **Create a Project:** If you don't have one already.
3.  **Enable the Google+ API:** Search for "Google+ API" (now deprecated, but still required for OAuth) or "People API" and enable it.
4.  **Create Credentials:** Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
5.  **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:** Follow the prompts to configure your consent screen. Provide an application name, support email, and authorized domains.
6.  **Specify Application Type:** Select "Web application".
7.  **Authorized JavaScript Origins:** Set this to `http://localhost:3000` (for development) and your production domain.
8.  **Authorized Redirect URIs:** This is crucial. Set this to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (or whatever endpoint you plan to handle the callback. See the "Implementing the Authentication Flow" section). Replace `3000` with your actual port if different. For production, this will be your production domain and callback path.
9.  **Copy the Client ID and Client Secret:** Store these securely.

### Facebook

1.  **Go to Facebook for Developers:** [https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2.  **Create an App:** Click "My Apps" > "Create App". Choose "Consumer" as the app type.
3.  **Configure Facebook Login:** In the app dashboard, find the "Facebook Login" product and click "Set Up".
4.  **Choose a Platform:** Select "Web".
5.  **Site URL:** Set this to `http://localhost:3000` (for development) and your production domain.
6.  **Settings > Basic:** Add your privacy policy URL, terms of service URL, and a category for your app. This is required before your app can go live.
7.  **Facebook Login > Settings:** Set "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/facebook` (or your chosen callback endpoint).
8.  **Copy the App ID and App Secret:** Store these securely.

### GitHub

1.  **Go to GitHub Developer Settings:** [https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2.  **Register a New OAuth App:** Click "OAuth Apps" > "New OAuth App".
3.  **Application Name:** Choose a descriptive name.
4.  **Homepage URL:** Set this to `http://localhost:3000` (for development) and your production domain.
5.  **Authorization Callback URL:** Set this to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github` (or your chosen callback endpoint).
6.  **Register Application:** Click "Register application".
7.  **Copy the Client ID and Client Secret:** Store these securely.

**Important:** Never commit your client secrets to your version control system! Use environment variables to store them securely.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

We'll use the `next-auth` library for handling the authentication flow. It's a powerful and flexible library that simplifies OAuth integration in Next.js (and Nuxt). While primarily designed for Next.js, it can be adapted for Nuxt with some adjustments.

```bash
npm install next-auth
# or
yarn add next-auth
# or
pnpm add next-auth
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Store your API credentials in `.env` files. Create `.env.development` for your local development and ensure you configure `.env.production` (or appropriate environment-specific files) when deploying to production.

```
# .env.development

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_SECURE_RANDOM_SECRET  # Generate a random string for encryption
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000  #Important for local development. Set to your production URL in production.
```

**Important:** `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is crucial for encrypting sessions. Generate a strong, random string (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32`). `NEXTAUTH_URL` is the base URL of your application, required by `next-auth` for proper routing.

## Step 4: Implementing the Authentication Flow

While `next-auth` is primarily for Next.js, we can leverage its providers within Nuxt by creating API routes (server routes in Nuxt 3) to handle the OAuth flows. This involves creating API endpoints for:

1.  **Initiating the Login:** Redirecting the user to the social provider's authorization page.
2.  **Handling the Callback:** Receiving the authorization code from the provider and exchanging it for an access token.
3.  **Creating a custom `[...nextauth].js` equivalent:** Since Nuxt 3 uses a different directory structure for API routes, we need to adapt how we create this file.

Create the following file structure inside your `server/api` directory:

```
server/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
```

```javascript
// server/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google'
import FacebookProvider from 'next-auth/providers/facebook'
import GithubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github'

export default async function auth(req, res) {
  return await NextAuth(req, res, {
    secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
    providers: [
      GoogleProvider({
        clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      }),
      FacebookProvider({
        clientId: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET,
      }),
      GithubProvider({
        clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
      }),
    ],
    callbacks: {
      async session({ session, token, user }) {
        // Add user ID to session
        session.user.id = token.sub // or token.id, depending on the provider
        return session
      },
    },
  })
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`NextAuth(req, res, { ... })`:** This is the core function from `next-auth` that handles the authentication flow. It takes the request and response objects and a configuration object.
- **`secret`:** The `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable.
- **`providers`:** An array of authentication providers. We're using `GoogleProvider`, `FacebookProvider`, and `GithubProvider`. Each provider requires a `clientId` and `clientSecret` obtained from the social provider's developer console.
- **`callbacks`**: Callbacks allow you to control what happens during the authentication process. Here, the `session` callback adds the user ID from the token to the session object. This is crucial for identifying the user in your application. You can also use the `jwt` callback for further customization.

## Step 5: Creating Login Buttons and Calling the API

Now, let's create login buttons in your Nuxt components and use the `useFetch` composable to call the authentication API.

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="signIn('google')">Sign in with Google</button>
    <button @click="signIn('facebook')">Sign in with Facebook</button>
    <button @click="signIn('github')">Sign in with GitHub</button>

    <p v-if="session">Logged in as: {{ session.user.email }}</p>
    <button v-if="session" @click="signOut">Sign Out</button>
    <p v-else>Not signed in</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useSession, signIn, signOut } from 'next-auth/react' // Mocking the React specific imports, will handle signIn and signOut manually
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';

const session = ref(null);
const loading = ref(true);

// Mocking useSession hook functionality
const fetchSession = async () => {
  loading.value = true;
  const { data } = await useFetch('/api/auth/session');
  session.value = data.value;
  loading.value = false;
};

onMounted(() => {
    fetchSession();
});

const signIn = async (provider) => {
  // Manually trigger the OAuth flow using useFetch
  const { data } = await useFetch(`/api/auth/signin/${provider}`, { method: 'POST' });
  window.location.href = data.value.url; // Redirect to the provider's login page
};


const signOut = async () => {
   await $fetch('/api/auth/signout', { method: 'POST' });
   await fetchSession(); // Update the session after signing out.
};

</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`signIn(provider)`:** This function is called when a user clicks on a social login button. It uses the `useFetch` composable to send a POST request to `/api/auth/signin/{provider}`. The `next-auth` library automatically handles the redirect to the social provider's authentication page based on the provider you specify. We redirect the user to the returned url manually as `useFetch` doesn't handle redirects out of the box.
- **`signOut()`:** This function signs the user out by sending a POST request to `/api/auth/signout`.
- **`useSession`**: Mocked here with `useFetch` and `ref` to grab the current session. The original `next-auth/react` hook is meant to be used in React-based components, so we emulate its behavior.
- **`fetchSession()`**: Fetches the session data from `/api/auth/session`.
- **Conditional Rendering:** The template displays different content depending on whether the user is signed in or not.

## Step 6: Creating the missing API endpoints.

We are using endpoints like `/api/auth/session`, `/api/auth/signin/google`, `/api/auth/signin/facebook`, `/api/auth/signin/github` and `/api/auth/signout`. These endpoints are automatically handled by `next-auth`. However, in Nuxt, we need to create simple API routes that utilize the central `[...nextauth].js` catch-all route.

Create these files under the `server/api/auth` directory:

**`/server/api/auth/session.js`**

```javascript
// /server/api/auth/session.js
import { unstable_getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next'
import authOptions from './[...nextauth].js' // Import the handler

export default async (req, res) => {
  const session = await unstable_getServerSession(req, res, authOptions.config)
  res.send(session)
}
```

**`/server/api/auth/signin/[provider].js`**

```javascript
// /server/api/auth/signin/[provider].js
import { unstable_getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next'
import authOptions from '../[...nextauth].js' // Import the handler
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'

export default async (req, res) => {
  const provider = req.url.split('/').pop()

  if (!['google', 'facebook', 'github'].includes(provider)) {
    return res.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid provider' })
  }

  const nextAuth = await NextAuth(req, res, authOptions.config)

  if (!nextAuth) {
    return res.status(500).send({ error: 'Authentication failed' })
  }

  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    authOptions.config.providers.forEach(async (p) => {
      if (p.id === provider) {
        const signInUrl = `/api/auth/signin/${provider}`

        try {
          const {
            data: { url },
          } = await $fetch.raw(`/api/auth/signin/${provider}`, {
            method: 'POST',
            baseURL: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL, // Ensure this is correct and set in your env
          })
          res.status(200).json({ url: url }) // Assuming you have NEXTAUTH_URL defined

          resolve()
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error during signIn:', error) // Log error for debugging
          res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to initiate sign-in' })
          resolve() // Still resolve to avoid hanging the request
        }
      }
    })
  })
}
```

**`/server/api/auth/signout.js`**

```javascript
// /server/api/auth/signout.js
import { unstable_getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next'
import authOptions from './[...nextauth].js' // Import the handler
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'

export default async (req, res) => {
  const session = await unstable_getServerSession(req, res, authOptions.config)

  if (!session) {
    return res.status(401).send({ error: 'Not signed in' })
  }

  await NextAuth(req, res, authOptions.config)
  res.status(200).send({ message: 'Sign Out Successful' })
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

- The `signIn` endpoint manually triggers the `next-auth` provider signin flow by constructing the relevant sign-in url and returning it. We utilize `$fetch.raw` from the server side context to ensure the correct headers are included to be processed by the catch-all route. This returns the redirect url, which is then returned to the client, where it is used to navigate the user to the authentication provider's page.
- The `signout` endpoint uses `next-auth` internally to perform the actual signout.

## Step 7: Accessing User Data

Once the user is authenticated, you can access their profile information from the `session` object. The `session` object typically contains the user's name, email, and profile picture. You can further customize the session object by adding additional user data in the `callbacks` section of the `[...nextauth].js` file.

For example, to access the user's email address:

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <p v-if="session">Logged in as: {{ session.user.email }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'
const { data: session } = useSession()
</script>
```

## Step 8: Securing Your Application

- **Environment Variables:** Store your client secrets and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` as environment variables and never commit them to your version control system.
- **Production URL:** Make sure to set the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to your production domain when deploying your application.
- **Authorized Redirect URIs:** Ensure that your "Authorized Redirect URIs" are correctly configured in your social provider's developer console. Incorrectly configured URIs can lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS in production to protect user data during transmission.

## Debugging

- **Console Logs:** Use `console.log` statements to debug your code and inspect the session object.
- **Network Tab:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect network requests and responses to identify any errors.
- **NextAuth.js Documentation:** Refer to the official NextAuth.js documentation for detailed information on configuration options, callbacks, and troubleshooting. The documentation is very useful for understanding how to troubleshoot issues arising from using `next-auth` inside Nuxt.
