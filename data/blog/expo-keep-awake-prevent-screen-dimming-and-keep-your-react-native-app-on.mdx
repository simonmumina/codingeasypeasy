# Expo Keep Awake: Prevent Screen Dimming & Keep Your React Native App On

Have you ever been frustrated when your React Native app's screen dims or goes to sleep in the middle of a critical process? Maybe you're building a fitness app that tracks workouts, a presentation app, or an application that displays live data that needs to stay visible.  The Expo `keep-awake` module is your solution!  This blog post dives deep into how to use `expo-keep-awake` effectively to enhance your app's user experience and ensure critical tasks run uninterrupted.

## What is Expo Keep Awake?

`expo-keep-awake` is a React Native module provided by Expo that allows you to programmatically prevent the device screen from dimming or sleeping.  It's a simple yet powerful tool for improving user experience in situations where constant visibility is crucial. It handles platform-specific implementations behind the scenes, making it a cross-platform solution for iOS and Android.

## Why Use Expo Keep Awake?

There are numerous scenarios where preventing screen dimming is beneficial:

*   **Navigation and Maps:**  Keep the map displayed while the user is actively navigating.
*   **Fitness Trackers:**  Prevent the screen from sleeping during workouts, ensuring continuous data recording.
*   **Presentation Apps:** Keep presentation slides visible during presentations.
*   **Data Visualization:**  Ensure dashboards and charts displaying real-time data remain visible.
*   **Video and Music Players:**  Maintain visibility during playback, even if the user isn't actively interacting.
*   **Long-Running Tasks:** Keep the screen on while tasks like file downloads, complex calculations, or background data syncing are in progress. This is *especially* important for user feedback during extended operations.

By preventing screen dimming, you contribute to a smoother, more user-friendly experience, avoiding frustration and ensuring that your app performs as expected in crucial situations.

## Getting Started with Expo Keep Awake

### 1. Installation

First, you need to install the `expo-keep-awake` package in your Expo project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx expo install expo-keep-awake
```

This command will automatically install the necessary dependencies and configure the module for your Expo project.

### 2. Basic Usage: `useKeepAwake` Hook

The recommended way to use `expo-keep-awake` is with the `useKeepAwake` hook. This React hook provides a declarative approach to managing the keep-awake state.

```javascript
import { useKeepAwake } from 'expo-keep-awake';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  useKeepAwake(isActive ? "my-keep-awake-tag" : null); // Add a tag for manageability

  const toggleKeepAwake = () => {
    setIsActive(!isActive);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Keep Awake Example</Text>
      <Text>Screen will stay awake: {isActive ? "Yes" : "No"}</Text>
      <Button title={isActive ? "Disable Keep Awake" : "Enable Keep Awake"} onPress={toggleKeepAwake} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`useKeepAwake(tag)`:**  The `useKeepAwake` hook accepts an optional `tag` parameter. This `tag` allows you to uniquely identify and manage multiple `keep-awake` instances within your application. Setting this tag to `null` disables `keep-awake`. Without a tag passed to `useKeepAwake`, the default tag `Expo` will be assigned.
*   **Conditional Logic:** The hook is conditionally enabled based on the `isActive` state variable.  This allows the user to easily toggle the keep-awake functionality on and off.
*   **Tag Management:**  Assigning a tag enables easier management of the keep-awake state, especially if you have multiple components that need to prevent screen dimming.
*   **Enabling and Disabling:** Pass a falsy value (like `null` or `undefined`) to `useKeepAwake` to disable the keep-awake functionality.

### 3. Advanced Usage: Managing Multiple Keep-Awake Instances

Imagine your app has different sections that require keeping the screen on, such as a workout tracker and a video player.  You can use tags to manage these instances independently.

```javascript
import { activateKeepAwake, deactivateKeepAwake } from 'expo-keep-awake';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [workoutActive, setWorkoutActive] = useState(false);
  const [videoActive, setVideoActive] = useState(false);

  const handleWorkoutToggle = () => {
    if (!workoutActive) {
      activateKeepAwake('workout-tag');
    } else {
      deactivateKeepAwake('workout-tag');
    }
    setWorkoutActive(!workoutActive);
  };

  const handleVideoToggle = () => {
    if (!videoActive) {
      activateKeepAwake('video-tag');
    } else {
      deactivateKeepAwake('video-tag');
    }
    setVideoActive(!videoActive);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Multiple Keep Awake Instances</Text>

      <Text>Workout Tracker: {workoutActive ? "Active" : "Inactive"}</Text>
      <Button title={workoutActive ? "Stop Workout" : "Start Workout"} onPress={handleWorkoutToggle} />

      <Text>Video Player: {videoActive ? "Active" : "Inactive"}</Text>
      <Button title={videoActive ? "Stop Video" : "Start Video"} onPress={handleVideoToggle} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`activateKeepAwake(tag)`:**  Activates the keep-awake functionality with the specified `tag`.
*   **`deactivateKeepAwake(tag)`:** Deactivates the keep-awake functionality associated with the specified `tag`.
*   **Independent Control:**  Each section (workout tracker and video player) has its own independent `keep-awake` instance, controlled by its respective tag.

### 4.  Using `KeepAwake.activate` and `KeepAwake.deactivate` (Less Recommended)

While the React Hook approach is generally preferred, the module also provides imperative functions for activating and deactivating the `keep-awake` state.  Note: It is best to use React Hooks unless you're working with a class component or don't have access to React component lifecycle.

```javascript
import * as KeepAwake from 'expo-keep-awake';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isActive) {
      KeepAwake.activate('imperative-tag'); // Activate keep-awake when component mounts and isActive is true
    } else {
      KeepAwake.deactivate('imperative-tag'); // Deactivate keep-awake when component unmounts or isActive is false
    }
    return () => {
      KeepAwake.deactivate('imperative-tag'); // Ensure deactivation when component unmounts
    };
  }, [isActive]);

  const toggleKeepAwake = () => {
    setIsActive(!isActive);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Keep Awake Example</Text>
      <Text>Screen will stay awake: {isActive ? "Yes" : "No"}</Text>
      <Button title={isActive ? "Disable Keep Awake" : "Enable Keep Awake"} onPress={toggleKeepAwake} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`KeepAwake.activate(tag)`:** Actively prevents the screen from dimming.
*   **`KeepAwake.deactivate(tag)`:**  Allows the screen to dim normally.
*   **`useEffect` Hook:**  The `useEffect` hook is used to manage the activation and deactivation of `keep-awake` based on the `isActive` state.  It also includes a cleanup function (the `return () => ...` part) to ensure that `keep-awake` is deactivated when the component unmounts, preventing unintended behavior.
* **Important:**  Always deactivate `keep-awake` when it's no longer needed to conserve battery life and prevent unexpected screen behavior. The cleanup function in the useEffect hook handles this when the component unmounts.  Make sure to set a `tag` so you can deactivate the correct instance of the `KeepAwake` module.

## Best Practices

*   **Use `useKeepAwake` Hook:** The `useKeepAwake` hook is generally preferred for its declarative approach and integration with React's component lifecycle.
*   **Deactivate When Not Needed:**  Always deactivate `keep-awake` when it's no longer required. This is crucial for conserving battery life and preventing the screen from staying on unnecessarily.
*   **Consider Battery Life:** Frequent use of `keep-awake` can significantly impact battery life.  Use it judiciously and only when absolutely necessary.
*   **Provide User Control:**  Offer users a clear way to toggle the `keep-awake` functionality. This gives them control over their device's battery consumption.
*   **Use Tags for Management:** If your app has multiple components or features that require `keep-awake`, use tags to manage them independently and prevent conflicts.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Screen Still Dims:** Double-check that you've correctly installed `expo-keep-awake` and that you are properly activating the functionality.  Ensure that no other part of your app is unintentionally deactivating `keep-awake`. Also, make sure that battery saver mode is not enabled on the device, as this might override the `keep-awake` functionality.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:**  If you encounter unexpected behavior, carefully review your code and ensure that you are deactivating `keep-awake` when it's no longer needed.  Check for conflicting logic that might be interfering with the module's functionality.

## Conclusion

Expo `keep-awake` is a valuable tool for enhancing the user experience in your React Native applications when continuous screen visibility is essential. By understanding its usage, best practices, and potential challenges, you can effectively integrate `keep-awake` into your projects and create a more polished and user-friendly app.  Remember to prioritize battery life and user control to ensure a balanced and positive user experience.
