# Troubleshooting gRPC "14 UNAVAILABLE: No connection established" in NestJS

The "14 UNAVAILABLE: No connection established" error in gRPC is a common and often frustrating issue when working with NestJS microservices.  It indicates that your gRPC client is unable to connect to the gRPC server.  This error can stem from various underlying problems, ranging from simple configuration errors to more complex network issues. This comprehensive guide provides a step-by-step approach to diagnose and resolve this error in your NestJS gRPC applications.

## Understanding the Error

Before diving into solutions, let's understand the error message more precisely. "14 UNAVAILABLE" is a gRPC status code that signifies that the requested service is currently unavailable. The "No connection established" part specifically points to a failure at the TCP connection level. This means the client was unable to successfully establish a socket connection with the server.

## Common Causes and Solutions

Here are some of the most common causes for this error and corresponding solutions, accompanied by code examples where appropriate:

**1. Server Not Running or Not Listening on the Correct Port:**

This is the most fundamental reason. Ensure your gRPC server is actually running and listening on the port specified in your client configuration.

*   **Solution:** Verify that your NestJS gRPC server application is actively running.  Check your logs for any startup errors.  Double-check the port configuration in your `main.ts` or corresponding configuration file.

    **Example (NestJS Server - main.ts):**

    ```typescript
    import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
    import { AppModule } from './app.module';
    import { MicroserviceOptions, Transport } from '@nestjs/microservices';
    import { join } from 'path';

    async function bootstrap() {
      const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(
        AppModule,
        {
          transport: Transport.GRPC,
          options: {
            package: 'hero', // Your protobuf package name
            protoPath: join(__dirname, 'hero', 'hero.proto'), // Path to your .proto file
            url: 'localhost:50051', // Ensure this port matches your client config
          },
        },
      );
      await app.listen();
    }
    bootstrap();
    ```

*   **Troubleshooting:**  Use `netstat -tulnp` (Linux) or `Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 50051).OwningProcess` (PowerShell on Windows, replacing 50051 with your port) to confirm that a process is listening on the expected port.

**2. Incorrect Client Configuration:**

The gRPC client must be configured with the correct server address (host and port).  Typos are common here.

*   **Solution:** Carefully review your client configuration, paying close attention to the server address. Make sure the host and port match the server's configuration.

    **Example (NestJS Client - a service consuming the gRPC service):**

    ```typescript
    import { Inject, Injectable, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { ClientGrpc } from '@nestjs/microservices';
    import { HeroById, Hero } from './interfaces/hero.interface';
    import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
    import { HeroService } from './interfaces/hero-service.interface';

    @Injectable()
    export class HeroesService implements OnModuleInit {
      private heroService: HeroService;

      constructor(@Inject('HERO_PACKAGE') private client: ClientGrpc) {}

      onModuleInit() {
        this.heroService = this.client.getService<HeroService>('Heroes'); // Service name in the .proto file
      }

      getHero(id: HeroById): Observable<Hero> {
        return this.heroService.FindOne(id);
      }
    }
    ```

    **Example (Client Module Configuration):**

    ```typescript
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { ClientsModule, Transport } from '@nestjs/microservices';
    import { join } from 'path';
    import { HeroesController } from './heroes.controller';
    import { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';

    @Module({
      imports: [
        ClientsModule.register([
          {
            name: 'HERO_PACKAGE', // Use this name when injecting the client
            transport: Transport.GRPC,
            options: {
              package: 'hero',
              protoPath: join(__dirname, 'hero', 'hero.proto'),
              url: 'localhost:50051', // CRITICAL: Verify this matches server config
            },
          },
        ]),
      ],
      controllers: [HeroesController],
      providers: [HeroesService],
    })
    export class HeroesModule {}

    ```

*   **Troubleshooting:** Use `console.log` to print the client configuration to the console during startup.  Verify that the host and port values are correct.

**3. Firewall Issues:**

Firewalls can block the connection between the client and the server.  This is especially common when the server and client are running on different machines or within a containerized environment.

*   **Solution:**  Ensure that your firewall allows traffic on the port used by your gRPC server.  This may involve configuring your operating system's firewall (e.g., `ufw` on Ubuntu, Windows Firewall) or the firewall of your network.  If using cloud-based services, check your security group rules.

*   **Troubleshooting:**  Temporarily disable the firewall (for testing purposes *only*) to see if this resolves the issue.  If it does, then you know the firewall is the problem, and you need to configure it correctly.  Use tools like `telnet` or `nc` (netcat) to test connectivity from the client machine to the server machine on the specific port.  For example: `telnet localhost 50051` or `nc -vz localhost 50051`.

**4. DNS Resolution Problems:**

If you are using a hostname instead of an IP address for the server, the client might be unable to resolve the hostname to an IP address.

*   **Solution:**  Verify that the hostname resolves to the correct IP address.  You can use the `ping` or `nslookup` commands to check DNS resolution.  If the hostname is not resolving correctly, update your DNS settings or use an IP address directly in the client configuration.

*   **Troubleshooting:** Try using the server's IP address directly in the client configuration to bypass DNS resolution. If this works, the problem is likely with DNS.

**5. Network Connectivity Issues:**

There might be general network connectivity issues between the client and the server, such as routing problems or network outages.

*   **Solution:**  Ensure that the client and server are on the same network or that there is a route between them.  Use network troubleshooting tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to diagnose network connectivity problems.

*   **Troubleshooting:** Try pinging the server from the client machine and vice-versa. If ping fails, there's a network connectivity issue that needs to be resolved.

**6. gRPC Version Mismatch:**

In rare cases, version mismatches between the gRPC client and server libraries can cause connectivity issues.

*   **Solution:**  Ensure that your gRPC client and server libraries are compatible.  It's generally best to use the same version of gRPC in both the client and server.

*   **Troubleshooting:** Check the versions of `@grpc/grpc-js` and `@nestjs/microservices` (or similar gRPC related packages) in your `package.json` files.  Try upgrading or downgrading one or both libraries to see if it resolves the issue.  Consult the documentation for your specific gRPC libraries for version compatibility information.

**7. TLS/SSL Configuration Issues:**

If you are using TLS/SSL for secure gRPC communication, there might be issues with your certificate configuration.

*   **Solution:**  Verify that your TLS/SSL certificates are valid and correctly configured on both the client and server. Ensure that the client is configured to trust the server's certificate.

*   **Troubleshooting:**  Examine the gRPC logs for TLS/SSL related errors. Double check your certificate paths and configuration.  Consider temporarily disabling TLS/SSL (for testing *only*) to see if this resolves the issue. If so, the problem lies within your TLS/SSL setup.

**8. Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) Issues:**

When using Docker or Kubernetes, network configurations become more complex.

*   **Solution:**

    *   **Docker:** Ensure that the server is exposing the correct port in the Dockerfile (`EXPOSE 50051`), and that the port is properly mapped when running the container (`docker run -p 50051:50051 ...`). Ensure that the client container can access the server container (e.g., through Docker Compose or Docker networking).  Consider using Docker Compose to simplify the setup.

    *   **Kubernetes:** Ensure that the server's service is correctly configured to expose the gRPC port.  Verify that the client pod can access the server service through the Kubernetes service name.  Check your network policies to ensure that traffic is allowed between the client and server pods.

*   **Troubleshooting:**  Use `docker ps` to check the port mappings of your Docker containers.  Use `kubectl get services` and `kubectl get pods` to verify the Kubernetes service and pod configurations. Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to view the logs of your client and server pods for any errors.

**9. Resource Exhaustion:**

While less common, the server might be overloaded and unable to accept new connections.

*   **Solution:**  Monitor the server's resource usage (CPU, memory, network) to identify potential bottlenecks.  Consider scaling up your server resources or optimizing your server code to improve performance.

*   **Troubleshooting:** Use tools like `top` (Linux) or the Task Manager (Windows) to monitor resource usage on the server. Examine your server logs for any performance-related warnings or errors.

## Code Example: Implementing Retry Logic

To make your gRPC client more resilient, you can implement retry logic to automatically retry failed connection attempts.  Here's an example using RxJS:

```typescript
import { Inject, Injectable, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ClientGrpc } from '@nestjs/microservices';
import { HeroById, Hero } from './interfaces/hero.interface';
import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { HeroService } from './interfaces/hero-service.interface';
import { retryWhen, delay, tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class HeroesService implements OnModuleInit {
  private heroService: HeroService;

  constructor(@Inject('HERO_PACKAGE') private client: ClientGrpc) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    this.heroService = this.client.getService<HeroService>('Heroes');
  }

  getHero(id: HeroById): Observable<Hero> {
    return this.heroService.FindOne(id).pipe(
      retryWhen(errors =>
        errors.pipe(
          tap(val => console.log(`Attempting retry, error: ${val}`)), // Log the error
          delay(2000), // Wait 2 seconds before retrying
          // Optionally, add a maximum retry count:
          // take(3), // Retry only 3 times
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `retryWhen`: This RxJS operator allows you to specify a custom retry strategy.
*   `errors.pipe(...)`: We pipe the error stream to define our retry behavior.
*   `tap`:  Logs the error for debugging.  Remove or adjust this in production.
*   `delay`:  Waits 2 seconds before retrying. Adjust this value as needed.
*   `take(3)` (Optional):  Limits the number of retry attempts to 3.  Remove this if you want to retry indefinitely.

**Important Notes:**

*   Retry logic can mask underlying problems. It's essential to still investigate the root cause of the "14 UNAVAILABLE" error, even with retry logic in place.
*   Be mindful of the potential for infinite retries.  Always include a maximum retry count or a timeout to prevent your application from getting stuck in a retry loop.
*   Consider using exponential backoff for retries to avoid overwhelming the server.  Exponential backoff increases the delay between each retry attempt.

## Logging and Monitoring

Effective logging and monitoring are crucial for diagnosing gRPC connectivity issues.  Implement comprehensive logging on both the client and server to capture error messages, request/response details, and performance metrics.  Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the health and performance of your gRPC services.
