# Sanitize User Input in Nuxt 3 Server Routes: Protect Your App from Attacks

In modern web development, security is paramount. One of the most critical aspects of building a secure application, especially when using frameworks like Nuxt 3 that offer server-side capabilities, is properly sanitizing user input. Failing to do so can leave your application vulnerable to various attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to sanitize user input in your Nuxt 3 server routes, protecting your application and your users from potential harm. We'll cover common vulnerabilities, best practices, and practical code examples.

## Why Sanitize User Input? Understanding the Threats

Before diving into the "how-to," let's understand the "why." User input is any data that your application receives from users, whether it's through form submissions, URL parameters, cookies, or API requests. If this data is not properly vetted and cleaned, it can be used to inject malicious code into your application. Here's a closer look at the most common threats:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS attacks involve injecting malicious JavaScript code into your website. When other users visit a page containing this injected code, their browsers will execute it. This can allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or even deface your website.

- **SQL Injection:** If your application interacts with a database, SQL injection attacks can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can grant them unauthorized access to your data, modify it, or even delete it entirely.

- **Command Injection:** If your server-side code executes operating system commands based on user input (which is often discouraged), a command injection attack can allow attackers to run arbitrary commands on your server.

- **Other Injection Attacks:** Beyond SQL and command injection, various other injection attacks exist, targeting different parts of your application's code and infrastructure.

## Best Practices for Sanitizing User Input in Nuxt 3

Here are some key best practices to follow when sanitizing user input in your Nuxt 3 server routes:

1.  **Input Validation:** Validate all user input to ensure it conforms to your expected format and data type. This includes checking for things like:

    - **Data Type:** Is the input a string, number, boolean, or other expected type?
    - **Length:** Is the input within acceptable length limits?
    - **Format:** Does the input match a specific pattern (e.g., email address, phone number)?
    - **Range:** Is the input within a valid range of values (e.g., age between 0 and 120)?
    - **Allowed Characters:** Does the input contain only allowed characters?

2.  **Encoding/Escaping:** Properly encode or escape user input before displaying it in your application or storing it in your database. This prevents malicious code from being interpreted as executable code.

3.  **Output Encoding:** When displaying user-provided content on your website, use appropriate output encoding to prevent XSS attacks. Nuxt and Vue handle a lot of this for you in templates, but you must be careful when using `v-html` or directly manipulating the DOM.

4.  **Least Privilege:** Run your application with the least amount of privileges necessary. This limits the damage that an attacker can cause if they manage to compromise your application.

5.  **Parameterization:** When querying databases, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This prevents SQL injection attacks by treating user input as data rather than executable code.

6.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources. This is particularly useful as a defense-in-depth measure.

7.  **Regular Updates:** Keep your Nuxt 3 installation, its dependencies (including libraries and database drivers), and your server environment up-to-date with the latest security patches.

8.  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your application to identify potential vulnerabilities. Tools like static analysis tools can help automate this process.

## Sanitization Techniques and Code Examples in Nuxt 3 Server Routes

Let's explore some practical sanitization techniques with code examples for Nuxt 3 server routes. We'll focus on common scenarios:

**1. Input Validation and Sanitization using `zod`**

`zod` is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It's excellent for defining the expected structure of your input and validating it. It also helps to provide static typing, which can prevent errors during development.

First, install `zod`:

```bash
npm install zod
# or
yarn add zod
# or
pnpm add zod
```

Then, create a server route that validates user input:

```typescript
// server/api/submit.ts
import { defineEventHandler, readBody } from 'h3'
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(3).max(50),
  email: z.string().email(),
  message: z.string().min(10).max(500),
})

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  try {
    const body = await readBody(event)

    // Validate the body against the schema
    const validatedData = schema.parse(body)

    // Process the validated data (e.g., save to database)
    console.log('Validated data:', validatedData)
    return { success: true, message: 'Data submitted successfully!' }
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Handle validation errors
    console.error('Validation error:', error)
    if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
      return { success: false, errors: error.errors }
    }
    return { success: false, message: 'An error occurred.' }
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `defineEventHandler` and `readBody` from `h3` (the underlying HTTP handler library used by Nuxt 3's server routes).
- We define a `zod` schema (`schema`) that describes the expected structure of the request body. It specifies the data types, lengths, and formats of the `name`, `email`, and `message` fields.
- Inside the `defineEventHandler` function, we use `readBody` to read the request body.
- We use `schema.parse(body)` to validate the body against the schema. If validation fails, `zod` throws an error.
- If validation succeeds, we can safely process the `validatedData`.
- We catch any errors (including `zod` validation errors) and return an appropriate error response to the client. This provides valuable feedback.

**2. Encoding/Escaping for XSS Prevention**

When displaying user input in your application, you need to encode or escape it to prevent XSS attacks. Vue's template syntax handles a lot of this automatically, but you must be cautious when using `v-html` or directly manipulating the DOM.

Here's a simple example of how to escape HTML entities manually if necessary (though using Vue's built-in features is generally preferable):

```javascript
function escapeHtml(unsafe) {
  return unsafe
    .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
    .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
    .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
    .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
    .replace(/'/g, '&#039;')
}
```

Then, in your Vue component:

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <p>User Input: {{ escapedUserInput }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const userInput = ref('<script>alert("XSS");</script>Hello!')

const escapedUserInput = computed(() => {
  return escapeHtml(userInput.value)
})

function escapeHtml(unsafe) {
  return unsafe
    .replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
    .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
    .replace(/>/g, "&gt;")
    .replace(/"/g, "&quot;")
    .replace(/'/g, "&#039;");
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- The `escapeHtml` function replaces potentially dangerous characters `(<, >, ", ')` with their corresponding HTML entities.
- The `escapedUserInput` computed property applies the `escapeHtml` function to the `userInput` before displaying it in the template. This ensures that any malicious code in the user input is rendered as plain text.

**Important:** Be extremely careful when using `v-html`. It bypasses Vue's built-in escaping and allows you to render raw HTML. Only use it with trusted content or content that has been thoroughly sanitized.

**3. Parameterized Queries for SQL Injection Prevention**

If your server routes interact with a database, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The exact syntax will vary depending on the database library you are using, but the principle is the same: separate the SQL code from the user-provided data.

Here's an example using `knex.js`, a popular SQL query builder for Node.js:

```typescript
// server/api/users.ts
import { defineEventHandler, getQuery } from 'h3'
import knex from 'knex'

const db = knex({
  client: 'sqlite3', // Or your database client (e.g., 'pg', 'mysql')
  connection: {
    filename: './mydb.sqlite',
  },
  useNullAsDefault: true,
})

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  try {
    const query = getQuery(event)
    const username = query.username as string // Get username from the query params

    // Use a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
    const users = await db('users').where('username', username).select('*')

    return users
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    return { error: 'Failed to retrieve users' }
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- We use `knex` to interact with the database. Make sure to install it: `npm install knex sqlite3` (or the appropriate database driver).
- Instead of concatenating the `username` directly into the SQL query string, we pass it as a parameter to the `where` method. `knex` will automatically handle the necessary escaping and quoting to prevent SQL injection.
- This approach ensures that the `username` is treated as data, not as part of the SQL code itself.

**4. Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)**

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that allows you to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources. This can significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks.

You can configure CSP in your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ... other configurations
  app: {
    head: {
      meta: [
        {
          'http-equiv': 'Content-Security-Policy',
          content:
            "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `default-src 'self'` allows resources to be loaded only from the same origin as the website.
- `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` allows scripts to be loaded from the same origin and allows inline scripts (scripts within HTML). **Important:** Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` if possible. Consider using nonces or hashes for inline scripts instead. If you _must_ use `unsafe-inline`, carefully review the justification.
- `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` allows styles to be loaded from the same origin and allows inline styles. Similar to scripts, avoid `'unsafe-inline'` if possible.

**Important:** Carefully configure your CSP to meet the specific requirements of your application. A overly restrictive CSP can break your website, while a too lenient CSP may not provide adequate protection. Use a CSP testing tool to validate your CSP configuration.

**5. Regular Expressions for Input Validation**

Regular expressions can be very useful for validating that user input conforms to specific patterns.

```typescript
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
  return emailRegex.test(email)
}
```

Then, in your server route (or Vue component):

```typescript
// server/api/validate.ts
import { defineEventHandler, getQuery } from 'h3'

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const query = getQuery(event)
  const email = query.email as string

  if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
    return { valid: false, message: 'Invalid email address' }
  }

  return { valid: true, message: 'Valid email address' }
})

function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/
  return emailRegex.test(email)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `isValidEmail` function uses a regular expression to check if the input string is a valid email address.
- The regular expression `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/` matches the basic email address format. You might need to adjust the regex based on your specific requirements.

## Conclusion

Sanitizing user input is an essential part of building secure web applications with Nuxt 3. By following the best practices and using the techniques outlined in this guide, you can significantly reduce the risk of XSS, SQL injection, and other security vulnerabilities. Remember that security is an ongoing process. Stay informed about the latest threats and vulnerabilities, and regularly review and update your security measures. Always err on the side of caution when dealing with user input. Don't trust user input, validate it, sanitize it, and encode it appropriately. Your users (and your application) will thank you for it!
