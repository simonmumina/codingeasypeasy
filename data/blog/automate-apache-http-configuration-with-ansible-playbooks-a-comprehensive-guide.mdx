# Automate Apache HTTP Configuration with Ansible Playbooks: A Comprehensive Guide

Apache HTTP Server, a widely used web server, requires careful configuration for optimal performance, security, and reliability. Manually configuring Apache across multiple servers can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where Ansible, a powerful automation engine, comes into play. This guide will walk you through using Ansible playbooks to automate the configuration of Apache HTTP servers.

## Why Use Ansible for Apache Configuration?

Ansible offers several advantages for managing Apache configurations:

- **Idempotency:** Ansible ensures that desired states are achieved without making unnecessary changes. If a configuration is already correct, Ansible won't modify it.
- **Declarative Approach:** You define the desired state of your Apache configuration in playbooks, and Ansible figures out how to achieve it.
- **Agentless Architecture:** Ansible doesn't require any agents to be installed on the target servers, simplifying deployment and maintenance. It relies on SSH for communication.
- **Version Control:** Ansible playbooks can be stored in version control systems like Git, allowing you to track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Scalability:** Ansible makes it easy to manage Apache configurations across a large number of servers.
- **Reduced Human Error:** Automation minimizes the risk of manual configuration errors, leading to a more stable and consistent environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **An Ansible Control Node:** A machine with Ansible installed and configured. You'll run playbooks from this node. Installation instructions can be found at the [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).
- **Target Servers:** One or more servers where Apache will be installed and configured. These servers must be accessible via SSH from the Ansible control node.
- **Basic Ansible Knowledge:** Familiarity with Ansible concepts like playbooks, tasks, modules, and variables.

## Setting Up Your Ansible Inventory

Ansible uses an inventory file to define the hosts it will manage. The default inventory file is typically located at `/etc/ansible/hosts`. Edit this file (or create a custom inventory file and specify it with the `-i` flag when running your playbooks) to include your target servers.

```ini
[webservers]
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
webserver2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
```

**Explanation:**

- `[webservers]` creates a group named "webservers".
- `webserver1` and `webserver2` are hostnames used in your playbook.
- `ansible_host` specifies the IP address or hostname of the actual server.

**Important:** Ensure SSH access is configured from your Ansible control node to the target servers using either password authentication or, preferably, SSH keys.

## Creating the Ansible Playbook

Now, let's create an Ansible playbook named `apache_config.yml`. This playbook will automate the installation and basic configuration of Apache.

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes # Required for tasks that need root privileges

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is installed
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian" # Only run on Debian-based systems

    - name: Ensure Apache is installed (RedHat Family)
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" # Only run on RedHat-based systems

    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: '{{ apache_service_name }}' # Variable for service name
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      vars:
        apache_service_name: 'apache2'
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Start Apache service (RedHat Family)
      service:
        name: '{{ apache_service_name }}' # Variable for service name
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      vars:
        apache_service_name: 'httpd'
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Copy default Apache configuration file
      copy:
        src: files/apache2.conf
        dest: /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Copy default Apache configuration file (RedHat Family)
      copy:
        src: files/httpd.conf
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: '{{ apache_service_name }}'
        state: restarted
      vars:
        apache_service_name: 'apache2'
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Restart Apache (RedHat Family)
      service:
        name: '{{ apache_service_name }}'
        state: restarted
      vars:
        apache_service_name: 'httpd'
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

**Explanation:**

- **`hosts: webservers`**: Specifies that this playbook should run on the hosts in the "webservers" group defined in your inventory.
- **`become: yes`**: Instructs Ansible to execute tasks with root privileges.
- **`tasks:`**: Defines a list of tasks to be executed.
  - **`apt` and `yum` modules**: These modules install the Apache package (`apache2` for Debian-based systems, `httpd` for RedHat-based systems) if it's not already installed. The `state: present` ensures that the package is installed. The `when` conditional statement allows the playbook to automatically switch the package manager depending on the OS distribution.
  - **`service` module**: This module starts and enables the Apache service. `state: started` ensures the service is running, and `enabled: yes` ensures it starts automatically on boot. The `apache_service_name` variable is used to easily switch the service name between different OS families.
  - **`copy` module**: This module copies a custom Apache configuration file from the `files` directory on the Ansible control node to the target server. The `owner`, `group`, and `mode` parameters set the file's permissions. The `notify: Restart Apache` line triggers the "Restart Apache" handler after the configuration file is copied. This ensures that Apache picks up the new configuration.
- **`handlers:`**: Defines handlers, which are tasks that are only executed when notified by another task.
  - **`Restart Apache` handler**: This handler restarts the Apache service using the `service` module.

## Creating the Configuration File (apache2.conf/httpd.conf)

Create a directory named `files` in the same directory as your `apache_config.yml` playbook. Inside this directory, place your custom `apache2.conf` (for Debian) or `httpd.conf` (for RedHat) file. This file will be copied to the target servers. For example, you might want to customize the `ServerName` or add specific modules.

A basic `apache2.conf` might look like this:

```plaintext
# Example apache2.conf

ServerName your_domain.com

<Directory /var/www/html>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

A basic `httpd.conf` might look like this:

```plaintext
# Example httpd.conf

ServerName your_domain.com

<Directory "/var/www">
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

**Remember to adjust the `ServerName` and other directives to match your specific requirements.**

## Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, use the following command from your Ansible control node:

```bash
ansible-playbook apache_config.yml
```

Ansible will connect to the target servers, execute the tasks defined in the playbook, and report the results.

## Configuring Virtual Hosts

Virtual hosts allow you to host multiple websites on a single Apache server. Let's create a playbook to automate the creation of virtual hosts.

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  vars:
    virtual_hosts:
      - servername: example.com
        documentroot: /var/www/example.com
        aliases:
          - www.example.com
      - servername: anotherdomain.com
        documentroot: /var/www/anotherdomain.com
        aliases:
          - www.anotherdomain.com

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure virtual host directories exist
      file:
        path: '{{ item.documentroot }}'
        state: directory
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data
        mode: 0755
      loop: '{{ virtual_hosts }}'
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Ensure virtual host directories exist (RedHat Family)
      file:
        path: '{{ item.documentroot }}'
        state: directory
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode: 0755
      loop: '{{ virtual_hosts }}'
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Create virtual host configuration files
      template:
        src: templates/vhost.conf.j2
        dest: '/etc/apache2/sites-available/{{ item.servername }}.conf'
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644
      loop: '{{ virtual_hosts }}'
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Create virtual host configuration files (RedHat Family)
      template:
        src: templates/vhost.conf.j2
        dest: '/etc/httpd/conf.d/{{ item.servername }}.conf'
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644
      loop: '{{ virtual_hosts }}'
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Enable virtual hosts
      file:
        src: '/etc/apache2/sites-available/{{ item.servername }}.conf'
        dest: '/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/{{ item.servername }}.conf'
        state: link
      loop: '{{ virtual_hosts }}'
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Enable virtual hosts (RedHat Family) - Alternative Approach
      command:
        cmd: 'a2enmod {{ item.servername }}'
      loop: '{{ virtual_hosts }}'
      args:
        chdir: /etc/httpd/conf.d
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Restart Apache (RedHat Family)
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

**Explanation:**

- **`vars:`**: Defines a variable `virtual_hosts` which is a list of dictionaries, each representing a virtual host configuration.
- **`loop: "{{ virtual_hosts }}"`**: Iterates through each virtual host defined in the `virtual_hosts` variable.
- **`file` module**: Creates the document root directories for each virtual host.
- **`template` module**: Creates the virtual host configuration files using a Jinja2 template.
- **`file` module (state: link)`**: Creates symbolic links in the `sites-enabled` directory to enable the virtual hosts on Debian based system.
- **`command` module** Runs the `a2enmod` command on redhat based systems to enable the sites.
- **`notify: Restart Apache`**: Triggers the "Restart Apache" handler after creating or enabling a virtual host.

## Creating the Virtual Host Template (vhost.conf.j2)

Create a directory named `templates` in the same directory as your playbook. Inside this directory, create a file named `vhost.conf.j2`. This is a Jinja2 template that will be used to generate the virtual host configuration files.

```jinja2
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName {{ item.servername }}
    {% if item.aliases %}
    ServerAlias {% for alias in item.aliases %}{{ alias }} {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
    DocumentRoot {{ item.documentroot }}

    <Directory {{ item.documentroot }}>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**Explanation:**

- `{{ item.servername }}`: Inserts the `servername` value from the `virtual_hosts` variable.
- `{{ item.documentroot }}`: Inserts the `documentroot` value.
- `{% if item.aliases %}` and `{% for alias in item.aliases %}`: Dynamically creates `ServerAlias` directives if aliases are defined.

## Security Hardening with Ansible

Security is crucial for any web server. Here's an example of how to use Ansible to harden your Apache configuration:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Disable unnecessary modules
      apache2_module:
        name: '{{ item }}'
        state: absent
      loop:
        - mod_info
        - mod_status
        - mod_negotiation
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Disable unnecessary modules (RedHat Family)
      shell:
        cmd: "httpd -M | grep {{ item }} | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -r httpd -k disable-module"
      loop:
        - info_module
        - status_module
        - negotiation_module
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Configure SSL/TLS
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/apache2/ports.conf
        regexp: '^Listen 80'
        line: 'Listen 443 ssl'
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Configure SSL/TLS (RedHat Family)
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
        regexp: '^Listen 80'
        line: 'Listen 443 ssl'
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Enable SSL module
      apache2_module:
        name: ssl
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Enable SSL module (RedHat Family)
      yum:
        name: mod_ssl
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Restart Apache (RedHat Family)
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```

**Explanation:**

- **`apache2_module` module (Debian):** This module disables unnecessary Apache modules like `mod_info` and `mod_status`, which can expose sensitive information.
- **`shell` module (RedHat):** Since RedHat doesn't have a direct equivalent to `apache2_module`, the `shell` module is used to execute a command that disables modules. This example uses a combination of `httpd -M`, `grep`, `awk`, and `xargs` to identify and disable the specified modules.
- **`lineinfile` module**: This module modifies the `ports.conf` file to listen on port 443 for SSL/TLS connections.
- **Enable SSL module**: Ensure the SSL module is enabled to enable the SSL encryption.
- **`notify: Restart Apache`**: Triggers the "Restart Apache" handler after making security-related changes.

**Remember:** This is just a basic example. You should adapt the security hardening steps to your specific requirements and security policies. Consider using a tool like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to automate the acquisition and renewal of SSL certificates.
