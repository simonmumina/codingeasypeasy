# How to Host Gatsby Website on AWS S3: A Step-by-Step Guide (2025)

Gatsby is a fantastic React-based framework for building blazing-fast static websites. Once you've built your Gatsby site, you need a reliable and cost-effective way to host it. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an excellent choice for hosting static websites due to its scalability, durability, and affordability. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your Gatsby site to AWS S3, step-by-step.

## Why Host Gatsby on AWS S3?

Before we dive in, let's quickly cover why S3 is a great option for hosting your Gatsby website:

- **Cost-Effective:** S3's pay-as-you-go pricing model is extremely economical for static websites. You only pay for the storage and bandwidth you use.
- **Scalability:** S3 can handle massive amounts of traffic without any configuration on your part. It scales automatically to meet demand.
- **Durability:** Amazon S3 boasts 99.999999999% durability, ensuring your website files are safe and available.
- **Integration with AWS Services:** S3 integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like CloudFront (CDN), Route 53 (DNS), and Certificate Manager (SSL certificates).
- **Simplicity:** Hosting static content on S3 is relatively straightforward and doesn't require managing servers.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following:

- **An AWS Account:** If you don't already have one, sign up for an AWS account at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- **The AWS CLI (Command Line Interface):** Install the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can find installation instructions at [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
- **Configured AWS Credentials:** Configure the AWS CLI with your AWS access key ID and secret access key. Run `aws configure` and follow the prompts.
- **A Gatsby Website:** You should have a Gatsby website ready to deploy. If you don't, you can create a basic one using the Gatsby CLI:

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g gatsby-cli
  gatsby new my-gatsby-site
  cd my-gatsby-site
  gatsby develop
  ```

## Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

1.  **Log in to the AWS Management Console.**
2.  **Navigate to the S3 service.** Search for "S3" in the AWS services search bar.
3.  **Click "Create bucket".**
4.  **Bucket Name:** Choose a globally unique name for your bucket. This name will be part of your website's URL (unless you use a custom domain). For example, `my-gatsby-website-example`. **Important:** The bucket name _must_ match your domain name if you intend to use a custom domain (e.g., `www.example.com`).
5.  **Region:** Select the AWS region closest to your target audience for optimal performance.
6.  **Block Public Access settings for this bucket:** **Uncheck** "Block _all_ public access". This is necessary to allow users to access your website. You'll configure more granular permissions later.
7.  **Bucket Versioning:** You can optionally enable versioning to keep a history of your website files. This is recommended for disaster recovery purposes.
8.  **Default Encryption:** You can optionally enable server-side encryption for data at rest.
9.  **Click "Create bucket".**

## Step 2: Configure S3 Bucket for Static Website Hosting

1.  **Select your newly created bucket** in the S3 console.
2.  **Click on the "Properties" tab.**
3.  **Scroll down to the "Static website hosting" section and click "Edit".**
4.  **Enable static website hosting:** Select "Enable".
5.  **Hosting type:** Choose "Host a static website".
6.  **Index document:** Enter `index.html`. This is the file that will be served when a user accesses the root URL of your website.
7.  **Error document (optional):** Enter `404.html` if you have a custom 404 page in your Gatsby site. If you don't have one, leave it blank.
8.  **Click "Save changes".**

## Step 3: Update Bucket Policy

You need to create a bucket policy that allows public read access to your website files.

1.  **Go to the "Permissions" tab of your S3 bucket.**
2.  **In the "Bucket policy" section, click "Edit".**
3.  **Paste the following policy, replacing `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket:**

    ```plaintext
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `Version`: Specifies the version of the policy language.
    - `Statement`: Contains an array of policy statements.
    - `Sid`: A statement identifier (optional).
    - `Effect`: Specifies whether the statement allows or denies access.
    - `Principal`: Specifies the entity that is granted access. `"*"` means everyone.
    - `Action`: Specifies the action that is allowed. `s3:GetObject` allows reading objects from the bucket.
    - `Resource`: Specifies the object or objects that the policy applies to. `arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*` grants access to all objects within your bucket.

4.  **Click "Save changes".** You may see a warning that the bucket has public access. This is expected since you're hosting a public website.

## Step 4: Build Your Gatsby Website

Before deploying to S3, you need to build your Gatsby website:

```plaintext
gatsby build
```

This command will generate a `public` directory containing the static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets of your website.

## Step 5: Deploy to S3 using the AWS CLI

Now, you'll use the AWS CLI to upload the contents of the `public` directory to your S3 bucket.

1.  **Navigate to the root directory of your Gatsby project** in your terminal.
2.  **Run the following command, replacing `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket:**

    ```plaintext
    aws s3 sync public/ s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/ --delete
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `aws s3 sync`: This command synchronizes the contents of a local directory with an S3 bucket.
    - `public/`: The source directory (your Gatsby build output).
    - `s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/`: The destination S3 bucket.
    - `--delete`: This option removes files from the S3 bucket that are no longer present in the local `public` directory. This is important to ensure that your website reflects the latest changes.

    **Important:** Using the `--delete` flag is generally recommended for deployments, but exercise caution if you manually manage files directly within the S3 bucket.

## Step 6: Access Your Website

You can now access your website using the S3 endpoint.

1.  **Go to the "Properties" tab of your S3 bucket.**
2.  **Find the "Static website hosting" section.**
3.  **The "Bucket website endpoint" will be listed.** It will look something like `http://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.s3-website-REGION.amazonaws.com`.

Open this URL in your browser to view your deployed Gatsby website!

## Step 7: (Optional) Configure CloudFront for CDN and SSL

While you can access your website directly through the S3 endpoint, it's highly recommended to use Amazon CloudFront, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), for improved performance, security (SSL/HTTPS), and caching.

1.  **Navigate to the CloudFront service in the AWS Management Console.**
2.  **Click "Create Distribution".**
3.  **Select "Web" as the delivery method.**
4.  **Origin Domain Name:** Enter your S3 bucket website endpoint (e.g., `my-gatsby-website-example.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). **Important:** Use the _website endpoint_, _not_ the bucket name.
5.  **Origin Access Identity:** It is recommended to use an Origin Access Identity (OAI) to restrict direct access to your S3 bucket and only allow access through CloudFront. Select "Yes (Use an Origin Access Identity)" and either create a new OAI or use an existing one. CloudFront will prompt you to update your bucket policy to allow the OAI access. Copy the suggested policy and paste it into your bucket policy in the S3 console (replacing the existing public read policy).
6.  **Viewer Protocol Policy:** Choose "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" to ensure all traffic is encrypted.
7.  **Allowed HTTP Methods:** Choose "GET, HEAD" for static websites.
8.  **Cache Based on Selected Request Headers:** Choose "Whitelist" and add "Origin" to the list if you're using serverless functions or other dynamic content that relies on the Origin header. Otherwise, leave it at "None (Improves Caching)".
9.  **Compress Objects Automatically:** Choose "Yes" to enable Gzip compression.
10. **Price Class:** Choose the price class that meets your needs. "US, Canada, Europe" is often a good balance of cost and performance.
11. **Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs) (optional):** If you have a custom domain (e.g., `www.example.com`), enter it here. You'll need to configure your DNS records to point to the CloudFront distribution.
12. **SSL Certificate (optional):**
    - **Request or Import a Certificate with ACM:** It is highly recommended to use HTTPS. Select "Request or Import a Certificate with ACM" to request a free SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). You'll need to verify domain ownership.
    - **Custom SSL Certificate:** If you already have an SSL certificate, you can import it.
13. **Default Root Object:** Enter `index.html`.
14. **Create Distribution.**

It will take some time (typically 15-30 minutes) for CloudFront to deploy your distribution. Once it's deployed, you can access your website through the CloudFront domain name (e.g., `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`).

## Step 8: (Optional) Configure Custom Domain and DNS

If you want to use a custom domain (e.g., `www.example.com`), you need to configure your DNS records.

1.  **Find the CloudFront distribution's domain name** in the CloudFront console.
2.  **Go to your DNS provider's management console.**
3.  **Create a CNAME record** that points your custom domain (e.g., `www.example.com`) to the CloudFront distribution's domain name (e.g., `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`).

If you're using Route 53, you can create an "Alias" record instead of a CNAME record. Alias records are AWS-specific and offer better performance and integration with CloudFront.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Invalidate CloudFront Cache:** After deploying updates to your website, you need to invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure that visitors see the latest version. You can do this in the CloudFront console. A common approach is to invalidate `/*` to clear the entire cache.

  - Using the AWS CLI:

    ```plaintext
    aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E1234567890ABC --paths '/*'
    ```

    Replace `E1234567890ABC` with your CloudFront distribution ID.

- **Automated Deployments:** Consider using a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, CircleCI) to automate the build and deployment process. This can significantly streamline your workflow. You can configure your CI/CD pipeline to run `gatsby build` and then use the AWS CLI to sync the `public` directory to S3 and invalidate the CloudFront cache.
- **Gatsby Cloud:** Gatsby Cloud is a platform specifically designed for hosting Gatsby sites. It provides features like automated builds, previews, and CDN integration. While it's a paid service, it can simplify the deployment process and provide performance benefits.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) and avoid hardcoding them in your code. Gatsby supports environment variables through `.env` files. Configure your build process to inject these variables into your Gatsby site.
- **Security:**
  - Use an Origin Access Identity (OAI) with CloudFront to restrict direct access to your S3 bucket.
  - Enable HTTPS using an SSL certificate.
  - Regularly review your S3 bucket policy and CloudFront configuration to ensure they are secure.
  - Consider using AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for added security.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor your S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution for performance and errors. AWS provides tools like CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration:** For faster uploads to S3, consider enabling S3 Transfer Acceleration. This feature uses AWS's globally distributed edge locations to accelerate data transfer. However, it may incur additional costs.

## Conclusion

Hosting your Gatsby website on AWS S3 is a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution. By following these steps, you can quickly deploy your website and take advantage of the benefits of AWS. Remember to leverage CloudFront for improved performance and security, and consider automating your deployment process for a streamlined workflow. Good luck!
