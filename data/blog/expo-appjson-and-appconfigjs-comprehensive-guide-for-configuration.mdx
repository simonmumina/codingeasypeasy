# Expo `app.json` and `app.config.js`: A Comprehensive Guide for Configuration

Expo is a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications with React Native.  A critical aspect of Expo development is managing your application's configuration, and that's where `app.json` and `app.config.js` come into play. This comprehensive guide will explore these two files, explaining their purpose, usage, and best practices for effective Expo app configuration.

## What are `app.json` and `app.config.js`?

In Expo, `app.json` and `app.config.js` are configuration files that define various aspects of your application, such as its name, version, icon, splash screen, and much more.  They act as a single source of truth for your app's metadata and settings.  This configuration data is then used by Expo to:

*   **Generate native builds:** When you build an APK or IPA, Expo uses the information in these files to configure the native project.
*   **Update your app over-the-air (OTA):** Expo uses the `updates` configuration to manage OTA updates using Expo Application Services (EAS).
*   **Provide metadata to app stores:** When submitting your app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, Expo uses the details in these files to populate the store listings.
*   **Expose configuration values to your JavaScript code:** You can access these values in your React Native components at runtime.

**Key Differences:**

*   **`app.json`:**  A static JSON file that can contain basic configuration settings. It's simpler and suitable for straightforward configurations that don't require dynamic values or complex logic.

*   **`app.config.js` (or `.ts`):**  A JavaScript (or TypeScript) file that exports a configuration object.  This allows for dynamic configuration using JavaScript logic, environment variables, and other programmatic features.  It provides much greater flexibility and is recommended for most projects, especially those with complex requirements or multiple environments (development, staging, production).

## Why Use `app.config.js` over `app.json`?

While `app.json` can be useful for very simple apps, `app.config.js` generally offers significant advantages:

*   **Dynamic Configuration:**  You can use JavaScript code to dynamically generate configuration values based on environment variables, build targets, or other runtime conditions.
*   **Environment Variables:**  Easily access environment variables using `process.env` to configure your app for different environments (development, staging, production).  This is crucial for managing API keys, database URLs, and other sensitive information.
*   **Code Reusability:**  You can import and reuse configuration logic across multiple projects or within the same project.
*   **Better Organization:**  For complex configurations, `app.config.js` allows you to structure your settings in a more organized and maintainable way.
*   **TypeScript Support:** If you are using TypeScript, `app.config.js` (or `app.config.ts`) allows you to type your configuration object, providing better code completion and error checking.

##  Creating and Configuring `app.config.js`

1.  **Create the file:**  In your Expo project's root directory, create a file named `app.config.js` (or `app.config.ts` if you're using TypeScript).

2.  **Export the Configuration Object:** Export a configuration object from the file. This object should contain the configuration properties that you want to define.

**Example `app.config.js`:**

```javascript
import 'dotenv/config'; // Optional: Load environment variables from .env file

export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    name: 'MyAppName',
    slug: 'my-app-slug',
    version: '1.0.0',
    orientation: 'portrait',
    icon: './assets/icon.png',
    splash: {
      image: './assets/splash.png',
      resizeMode: 'cover',
      backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
    },
    updates: {
      fallbackToCacheTimeout: 0,
      url: process.env.EXPO_UPDATE_URL, // Example using environment variable
    },
    assetBundlePatterns: ['**/*'],
    ios: {
      supportsTablet: true,
      bundleIdentifier: 'com.example.myapp',
      buildNumber: '1.0.0',
    },
    android: {
      adaptiveIcon: {
        foregroundImage: './assets/adaptive-icon.png',
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
      },
      package: 'com.example.myapp',
      versionCode: 1,
    },
    web: {
      favicon: './assets/favicon.png',
    },
    extra: {
      apiUrl: process.env.API_URL, // Accessing API URL from environment variables
    },
  };
};
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`import 'dotenv/config';`**: This line imports the `dotenv` package (if you have it installed) and loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. Make sure to install the `dotenv` package: `npm install dotenv`.
*   **`export default ({ config }) => { ... }`**:  This exports a default function that receives the existing configuration (`config`) as an argument.  This is important because it allows you to extend the default configuration and avoid overwriting existing settings.  It's generally recommended to use this functional approach rather than directly exporting a static object.
*   **`...config`**:  This uses the spread operator to include all the existing configuration properties in the new configuration object.  This ensures that you don't accidentally override any default settings.
*   **`name`, `slug`, `version`, `orientation`, `icon`**:  Basic app metadata that defines the name, URL-friendly slug, version number, supported orientations, and app icon.
*   **`splash`**: Configuration for the app's splash screen, including the image, resize mode, and background color.
*   **`updates`**: Settings for over-the-air (OTA) updates using Expo Application Services (EAS).  `fallbackToCacheTimeout` specifies how long to wait before falling back to the cached version of the app.  `url` is the URL where updates are hosted.  We are using an environment variable for the `url` which is best practice.
*   **`assetBundlePatterns`**:  An array of glob patterns that specify which files should be included in the app's asset bundle.
*   **`ios`**:  Platform-specific configuration for iOS, including settings like `supportsTablet`, `bundleIdentifier`, and `buildNumber`.
*   **`android`**:  Platform-specific configuration for Android, including settings like the adaptive icon, package name, and version code.
*   **`web`**: Platform-specific configuration for web, including the favicon.
*   **`extra`**:  An object that allows you to define custom configuration values that you can access in your React Native code. In this example, we're defining an `apiUrl` using an environment variable.

## Accessing Configuration Values in Your React Native Code

You can access the values defined in `app.json` or `app.config.js` using the `Constants` module from the `expo-constants` package.

**Example:**

```javascript
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const apiUrl = Constants.expoConfig.extra.apiUrl;

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>API URL: {apiUrl}</Text>
      <Text>App Name: {Constants.expoConfig.name}</Text>
      <Text>App Version: {Constants.expoConfig.version}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this example, we're importing `Constants` from `expo-constants` and accessing the `apiUrl` from the `extra` object, as well as the app name and version. We need to make sure that the `Constants.expoConfig` is not `null`. This usually happens when running in an environment where the Expo config is not available, such as in a detached Expo app or a bare React Native app. You can check if `Constants.expoConfig` is available before accessing its properties:

```javascript
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const apiUrl = Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.apiUrl || 'API URL not found';
  const appName = Constants.expoConfig?.name || 'App Name not found';
  const appVersion = Constants.expoConfig?.version || 'App Version not found';


  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>API URL: {apiUrl}</Text>
      <Text>App Name: {appName}</Text>
      <Text>App Version: {appVersion}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Using Environment Variables

Environment variables are essential for managing configuration values that vary across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).  They allow you to avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys or database URLs in your code.

**Steps to Use Environment Variables:**

1.  **Install `dotenv`:** `npm install dotenv`

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**  In your project's root directory, create a file named `.env`.

3.  **Define your environment variables in the `.env` file:**

    ```
    API_URL=https://api.example.com
    EXPO_UPDATE_URL=https://updates.example.com
    ```

4.  **Load environment variables in `app.config.js`:**

    ```javascript
    import 'dotenv/config'; // Load environment variables from .env file

    export default ({ config }) => {
      return {
        ...config,
        extra: {
          apiUrl: process.env.API_URL,
        },
        updates: {
          url: process.env.EXPO_UPDATE_URL
        }
      };
    };
    ```

5.  **Access environment variables in your React Native code:** (See the example above)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Don't commit `.env` files to your Git repository!**  Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.
*   **Set environment variables on your deployment server.**  When deploying your app to a production environment, you'll need to set the environment variables on the server or hosting platform.  This is typically done through the platform's configuration settings.
*   **Use different `.env` files for different environments.**  You can create separate `.env` files for development, staging, and production (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`).  Use a tool like `cross-env` to switch between these files based on the environment.

## Platform-Specific Configuration

Expo allows you to configure your app differently for iOS and Android using the `ios` and `android` properties in `app.config.js`.  This is useful for handling platform-specific requirements, such as setting the bundle identifier (iOS) or package name (Android).

**Example:**

```javascript
export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    ios: {
      bundleIdentifier: 'com.example.myapp.ios',
    },
    android: {
      package: 'com.example.myapp.android',
    },
  };
};
```

**Common Platform-Specific Settings:**

*   **`bundleIdentifier` (iOS):**  The unique identifier for your iOS app.
*   **`buildNumber` (iOS):**  The build number of your iOS app.  Increment this for each new build that you submit to the App Store.
*   **`package` (Android):**  The unique package name for your Android app.
*   **`versionCode` (Android):**  The version code of your Android app.  Increment this for each new build that you submit to the Google Play Store.
*   **`permissions` (iOS and Android):**  An array of permissions that your app requires (e.g., camera, location, microphone).
*   **`googleServicesFile` (Android):** Path to your `google-services.json` file, used for Firebase integration.
*   **`infoPlist` (iOS):** An object to manipulate the info.plist file.

## Expo Plugins and Configuration

Expo plugins are a powerful way to extend the functionality of your Expo app and automatically configure native dependencies. Many plugins require specific settings to be added to your `app.config.js` file. The documentation for each plugin will typically provide instructions on how to configure it.

**Example with `expo-notifications`:**

The `expo-notifications` plugin requires you to configure push notifications settings in your `app.config.js`.

```javascript
export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    plugins: [
      ['expo-notifications', {
        icon: './assets/notification-icon.png',
        color: '#ffffff',
      }],
    ],
    ios: {
      supportsTablet: true,
      bundleIdentifier: 'com.example.myapp',
      buildNumber: '1.0.0',
      config: {
         // required for push notifications to work on iOS
         usesNonExemptEncryption: false,
      },
    },
    android: {
      adaptiveIcon: {
        foregroundImage: './assets/adaptive-icon.png',
        backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
      },
      package: 'com.example.myapp',
      versionCode: 1,
      softwareKeyboardLayoutMode: 'pan',
    },
  };
};
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`plugins`:**  An array of plugins that your app uses.  Each plugin can have its own configuration options.
*   The `expo-notifications` plugin is configured with an `icon` and `color` for push notifications.
* The `ios` object contains an example where the `config` object can be manipulated and modified.

## Best Practices for Managing `app.config.js`

*   **Use `app.config.js` over `app.json` for most projects.**  It provides more flexibility and features for dynamic configuration.
*   **Use environment variables to manage sensitive information and environment-specific settings.**
*   **Keep your `app.config.js` file organized and well-structured.**  Use comments to explain the purpose of each configuration property.
*   **Use platform-specific configuration (`ios`, `android`) to handle platform-specific requirements.**
*   **Consult the Expo documentation and plugin documentation for specific configuration requirements.**
*   **Test your configuration thoroughly on different devices and platforms.**
*   **Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to your `app.config.js` file.**
*   **Use JSON-based comments within the javascript object. It will be removed by Expo CLI.**

```js
/**
 *  Configuration for Expo app.
 */
export default ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    name: 'MyAppName', // the app name
    slug: 'my-app-slug', // the app slug
    version: '1.0.0', // the app version
  };
};
```

## Conclusion

`app.json` and, more commonly, `app.config.js` are essential files for configuring your Expo application. By mastering these files, you can effectively manage your app's metadata, platform-specific settings, and environment variables, ultimately leading to a more robust and maintainable Expo app.  By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your app is properly configured for different environments and platforms, and that you're able to easily manage its configuration as it evolves. Remember to consult the Expo documentation for the latest information and updates on `app.json` and `app.config.js`.
