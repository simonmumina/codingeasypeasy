# How to Access Current Route Information in Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide

Next.js provides a powerful routing system that allows you to build dynamic and interactive web applications.  A crucial aspect of working with routing is the ability to access information about the current route, such as the URL pathname, query parameters, and dynamic route segments. This information is often necessary for rendering content, making API calls, and controlling the user experience. This guide will walk you through the different ways to access current route information in Next.js, leveraging the `useRouter` hook provided by `next/router`.

## Understanding the `next/router`

The `next/router` module offers a `useRouter` hook, which provides access to the `Router` object. This object contains information about the current route and provides methods for navigating between pages.  It's a fundamental tool for building any non-trivial Next.js application.

### When to use `useRouter`

The `useRouter` hook is available only within **client-side components**. This means you can use it inside components that are rendered in the browser, such as components within your `pages` directory or any client-side rendered component you import into your pages. You **cannot** use `useRouter` inside `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` because those functions run on the server and do not have access to the client-side routing context.  For server-side data fetching, you'll need to utilize different methods (which we'll touch on later for `getServerSideProps`).

## Accessing Route Information with `useRouter`

Let's dive into how you can access various parts of the route using the `useRouter` hook.

### Importing and Using `useRouter`

First, import the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` module:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
```

Then, inside a functional component, you can use the hook like this:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Access route information here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Key Properties of the `Router` Object

The `router` object returned by `useRouter` contains several important properties:

*   **`pathname`**:  The path segment of the URL.  For example, if the URL is `/blog/my-article`, the `pathname` will be `/blog/my-article`.
*   **`query`**: An object containing the parsed query string parameters from the URL. If the URL is `/products?category=electronics&sort=price`, the `query` object will be `{ category: 'electronics', sort: 'price' }`.
*   **`asPath`**: The actual path (including the query parameters) shown in the browser.  This is useful for displaying the full URL. For example, if the URL is `/blog/my-article?page=2`, the `asPath` will be `/blog/my-article?page=2`.
*   **`route`**: The route matched by the router, which might be different from the `pathname` in the case of dynamic routes. This is generally the same as `pathname` for most cases.
*   **`basePath`**: The base path configured in your `next.config.js`.
*   **`isReady`**: A boolean that indicates whether the router fields are updated client-side after initial render. Useful to avoid errors from accessing `router` properties before Next.js has finished hydrating the route information.

### Example: Displaying Route Information

Here's a component that displays the `pathname`, `query`, and `asPath`:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function RouteInfo() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Pathname: {router.pathname}</p>
      <p>Query: {JSON.stringify(router.query)}</p>
      <p>AsPath: {router.asPath}</p>
      <p>Is Ready: {router.isReady ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default RouteInfo;
```

Place this component in one of your pages, and you will see the current route information rendered on the screen.

### Handling the `isReady` Property

Since Next.js performs initial server-side rendering, the `router` object might not be fully populated immediately when the component mounts on the client-side. The `isReady` property helps you handle this situation. You can use it to conditionally render content based on the route information being available.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();

  if (!router.isReady) {
    return <div>Loading route information...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Pathname: {router.pathname}</p>
      <p>Query Parameter: {router.query.myParam}</p> {/* Example: Accessing a specific query parameter */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This ensures that you don't try to access properties of the `router` object before they are available, preventing potential errors.

## Accessing Query Parameters

As shown in the examples above, the `query` property of the `router` object is an object containing all the query parameters from the URL.  You can access individual query parameters using the dot notation or bracket notation:

```javascript
// Assuming the URL is /products?category=electronics&sort=price
const category = router.query.category; // category will be 'electronics'
const sort = router.query['sort'];      // sort will be 'price'
```

**Type Safety with TypeScript:**

If you are using TypeScript, you can define an interface or type for your query parameters to ensure type safety when accessing them:

```typescript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { ParsedUrlQuery } from 'querystring';

interface ProductQuery extends ParsedUrlQuery {
  category?: string;
  sort?: string;
  page?: string;
}

function ProductsPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { category, sort, page } = router.query as ProductQuery; // Type assertion

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <p>Category: {category || 'All'}</p>
      <p>Sort: {sort || 'Relevance'}</p>
      <p>Page: {page || '1'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProductsPage;
```

This approach provides better code maintainability and helps prevent runtime errors related to accessing non-existent properties on the `query` object.  The `ParsedUrlQuery` type from `querystring` is used as a base for the `ProductQuery` interface. The `?` after each property makes them optional.

## Working with Dynamic Routes

Next.js allows you to create dynamic routes using square brackets in your page filenames.  For example, a file named `pages/blog/[slug].js` will create a dynamic route where `slug` is a parameter that can be accessed through the `router.query` object.

### Example: Accessing Dynamic Route Parameters

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query; // Access the 'slug' parameter

  if (!router.isReady) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog Post: {slug}</h1>
      {/* Fetch and display the blog post content based on the slug */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default BlogPost;
```

In this example, if you navigate to `/blog/my-first-post`, the `slug` variable will be equal to `'my-first-post'`. You can then use this value to fetch the appropriate blog post data from your database or API.

## Programmatic Navigation

The `router` object also provides methods for programmatic navigation:

*   **`router.push(url, as, options)`**:  Navigates to the specified URL.
    *   `url`: The URL to navigate to (required). This can be an internal path or an external URL.
    *   `as`:  The URL to show in the browser (optional). This is useful for URL masking or pretty URLs.
    *   `options`:  An object containing additional options, such as `{ shallow: true }` for shallow routing (optional).
*   **`router.replace(url, as, options)`**: Similar to `router.push`, but replaces the current history state instead of adding a new one.
*   **`router.back()`**: Navigates back to the previous page in the browser history.
*   **`router.forward()`**: Navigates forward in the browser history.

### Example: Programmatic Navigation

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyButton() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/about'); // Navigate to the /about page
    // Or with URL masking:
    // router.push('/about', '/our-company'); // Navigate to /about but show /our-company in the address bar
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to About Page</button>
  );
}

export default MyButton;
```

## Accessing Route Information in `getServerSideProps`

As mentioned earlier, you cannot use `useRouter` within `getServerSideProps` because it's a client-side hook.  Instead, you can access the route information through the `context` object that is passed as an argument to `getServerSideProps`.

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { params, query, req, res, resolvedUrl } = context;

  // Access the route parameters (for dynamic routes)
  const { slug } = params || {};

  // Access the query parameters
  const { category, sort } = query;

  // You can also access the request and response objects

  return {
    props: {
      slug: slug || null,
      category: category || null,
      sort: sort || null,
    },
  };
}
```

The `context` object contains:

*   **`params`**: An object containing the route parameters for dynamic routes.
*   **`query`**: An object containing the query parameters.
*   **`req`**: The HTTP request object.
*   **`res`**: The HTTP response object.
*   **`resolvedUrl`**: The resolved URL of the request.

You can then pass this data as props to your page component and use it to render the content.

## Common Use Cases

Here are a few common use cases where accessing route information is essential:

*   **Conditional Rendering:**  Displaying different content based on the current route.  For example, showing a different header or navigation menu on different pages.
*   **Data Fetching:** Fetching data based on route parameters or query parameters. For example, fetching a specific blog post based on its slug.
*   **Breadcrumb Navigation:**  Building a breadcrumb navigation trail based on the current route.
*   **Analytics Tracking:** Tracking page views and user behavior based on the current route.
*   **Dynamic SEO:** Dynamically generating meta tags and SEO information based on route parameters and content.

## Best Practices

*   **Use the `isReady` Property:** Always check the `isReady` property before accessing the `router` object to avoid errors during initial rendering.
*   **Type Safety with TypeScript:** Use TypeScript to define types for your query parameters to improve code maintainability and prevent runtime errors.
*   **Handle Dynamic Routes Carefully:**  Be mindful of potential security vulnerabilities when working with dynamic routes. Sanitize and validate any user-provided input before using it in your data fetching logic.
*   **Avoid Server-Side Rendering of Client-Side Logic:** Don't try to use `useRouter` in `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`. Use the `context` object instead.

## Conclusion

Accessing route information is a fundamental skill for building dynamic and interactive Next.js applications. The `useRouter` hook provides a powerful and convenient way to access the `pathname`, `query`, and other properties of the current route on the client-side. For server-side data fetching, the `getServerSideProps` function provides access to route information through the `context` object. By understanding these concepts and following best practices, you can effectively leverage Next.js's routing capabilities to create seamless and engaging user experiences.
