# Real-Time Data with FastAPI and GraphQL Subscriptions: A Comprehensive Guide

In today's data-driven world, real-time updates are crucial for creating engaging and responsive user experiences.  This blog post explores how to combine the power of FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+, with GraphQL subscriptions to deliver real-time data to your clients. We'll be using Ariadne, a schema-first Python library for implementing GraphQL servers, to handle our GraphQL needs, and WebSockets for the persistent connection required for subscriptions.

## Why FastAPI and GraphQL Subscriptions?

*   **FastAPI:** Known for its speed, automatic data validation, and easy-to-use API, FastAPI makes building robust backend APIs a breeze.
*   **GraphQL Subscriptions:**  GraphQL subscriptions enable a client to receive real-time updates from the server whenever a specific event occurs. This is ideal for applications like:
    *   Real-time dashboards
    *   Live chat applications
    *   Stock tickers
    *   Collaborative editing tools

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.7+:** FastAPI requires Python 3.7 or higher.
*   **pip:** Python's package installer.

## Setting up the Project

First, create a new project directory and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir fastapi-graphql-subscriptions
cd fastapi-graphql-subscriptions
```

Next, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

Now, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn ariadne graphql-ws starlette-context
```

Let's break down these packages:

*   **fastapi:** The core FastAPI framework.
*   **uvicorn:** An ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server for running FastAPI applications.
*   **ariadne:**  A Python library for building GraphQL servers.
*   **graphql-ws:** A library that handles the GraphQL over WebSocket protocol.
*   **starlette-context:** Middleware to pass request context into GraphQL resolvers.

## Defining the GraphQL Schema

Create a file named `schema.graphql` and define your GraphQL schema.  For this example, we'll create a simple subscription that pushes a random number every second.

```graphql
type Query {
  hello: String
}

type Subscription {
  randomNumber: Int!
}
```

## Implementing the GraphQL Server with Ariadne

Create a file named `main.py` and add the following code:

```python
import asyncio
import random
from typing import AsyncGenerator

from ariadne import QueryType, SubscriptionType, make_executable_schema, graphql_sync, upload_scalar, MutationType
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse, JSONResponse
from starlette.websockets import WebSocket
from starlette_context import context, middleware
from starlette_context.middleware import RawContextMiddleware

# Define type definitions (schema)
with open("schema.graphql", "r") as f:
    type_defs = f.read()

# Query type
query = QueryType()

@query.field("hello")
def resolve_hello(_, info):
    request: Request = info.context["request"]
    user_agent = request.headers.get("user-agent", "guest")
    return f"Hello, {user_agent}!"

# Subscription type
subscription = SubscriptionType()

@subscription.source("randomNumber")
async def random_number_source() -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield random.randint(1, 100)

@subscription.field("randomNumber")
def random_number_resolver(number: int, info):
    return number

# Make executable schema
schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query, subscription)

# FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Add context middleware
app.add_middleware(RawContextMiddleware)

# GraphQL endpoint
graphql_app = GraphQL(schema, debug=True)
app.add_route("/graphql", graphql_app)

@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return HTMLResponse("""
    <h1>GraphQL Subscriptions Example</h1>
    <p>Visit <a href="/graphql">/graphql</a> to interact with the GraphQL API.</p>
    """)


@app.websocket_route("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            await websocket.send_text(f"Message text was: {data}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"WebSocket error: {e}")
    finally:
        await websocket.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

Let's break down the code:

*   **Import necessary modules:** We import modules from FastAPI, Ariadne, and other libraries.
*   **Load the schema:** The `schema.graphql` file is read and its content is stored in `type_defs`.
*   **Define resolvers:**
    *   `resolve_hello` resolves the `hello` query.  It accesses the request context to get the user-agent.
    *   `random_number_source` is a generator function that emits a random number every second. This function is responsible for generating the data that will be pushed to the client. Note the use of `AsyncGenerator` for asynchronous generation.
    *   `random_number_resolver` resolves the `randomNumber` subscription field.  It simply returns the number generated by the source.
*   **Create the schema:**  `make_executable_schema` combines the type definitions and resolvers to create a GraphQL schema.
*   **Create the FastAPI app:** An instance of `FastAPI` is created.
*   **Add Context Middleware:** `RawContextMiddleware` allows us to pass request context to GraphQL resolvers
*   **Add the GraphQL endpoint:**  An instance of `GraphQL` from `ariadne.asgi` is created with the schema, and is mounted as a route with `/graphql`. Debugging is enabled.
*   **Define index route:**  A basic HTML response is returned on the root route.
*   **Define a basic WebSocket route:** Implemented for demonstration purposes.  This does not use the GraphQL subscription logic.
*   **Run the app:** The `uvicorn` server is used to run the FastAPI application on `0.0.0.0:8000`.

## Testing the GraphQL Subscriptions

1.  **Run the FastAPI application:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2.  **Access the GraphQL endpoint:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/graphql`.  You can use a GraphQL client like GraphiQL or Apollo Client to interact with the API.

3.  **Execute the subscription:** In your GraphQL client, enter the following subscription query:

    ```graphql
    subscription {
      randomNumber
    }
    ```

    You should start receiving real-time updates with random numbers every second.

## Using a GraphQL Client with Subscriptions (Example using Altair)

Altair is a popular GraphQL client that supports subscriptions.  Here's how you can configure it:

1.  **Install Altair:** Download and install the Altair GraphQL Client from [https://altair.sirvion.net/](https://altair.sirvion.net/).

2.  **Configure the endpoint:** In Altair, set the GraphQL endpoint to `ws://localhost:8000/graphql`.  **Important:** Note the `ws://` protocol for WebSockets, and ensure that you're using `wss://` for secure connections in production environments.

3.  **Execute the subscription query:** Enter the following subscription query in Altair:

    ```graphql
    subscription {
      randomNumber
    }
    ```

    Click the "Play" button to start the subscription. You should now see real-time updates.

## Handling Errors and Disconnections

In a real-world application, you'll need to handle errors and disconnections gracefully. Ariadne provides mechanisms for handling errors within resolvers.  You'll also need to consider how to manage WebSocket disconnections and reconnections.

*   **Error Handling in Resolvers:**  Use `try...except` blocks within your resolvers to catch potential errors and return appropriate error messages to the client.
*   **WebSocket Disconnections:**  Implement logic to handle WebSocket disconnections.  You can use the `on_disconnect` event in your WebSocket handler to perform cleanup tasks.
*   **Client-Side Reconnections:**  On the client side, use a library or implement custom logic to automatically reconnect to the WebSocket if the connection is lost. Libraries like `graphql-ws` for JavaScript provide built-in reconnection mechanisms.

## Going Further: Implementing Mutations and Queries

This example focused on subscriptions, but you can easily extend it to include mutations and queries. Simply define the appropriate types and resolvers in your `schema.graphql` and `main.py` files.

```graphql
type Query {
  getMessage(id: ID!): String
}

type Mutation {
  createMessage(text: String!): String
}
```

And in `main.py`:

```python
# ... existing code ...

mutation = MutationType()

@mutation.field("createMessage")
def resolve_create_message(_, info, text: str):
    # Add your logic to create a new message here
    new_message = f"Created message: {text}"
    return new_message

@query.field("getMessage")
def resolve_get_message(_, info, id: str):
  # Add your logic to retrieve a message
  return f"Message with ID {id}"


schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query, subscription, mutation)

# ... rest of the code ...

```

## Security Considerations

*   **Authentication:**  Implement authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access your GraphQL API.  You can use FastAPI's security features and integrate with authentication providers like OAuth 2.0.
*   **Authorization:**  Implement authorization to control which users can access specific data or perform specific actions.  You can use GraphQL directives or custom logic within your resolvers to enforce authorization rules.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API.  FastAPI provides middleware for rate limiting.
*   **Input Validation:**  Ensure that all user input is properly validated to prevent injection attacks.  FastAPI's automatic data validation helps with this.
*   **WebSocket Security:** For production, ensure you are using `wss://` which uses TLS for secure connection via websockets.
