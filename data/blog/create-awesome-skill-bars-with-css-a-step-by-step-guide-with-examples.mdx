# Create Awesome Skill Bars with CSS: A Step-by-Step Guide with Examples

Skill bars are a common UI element used on portfolios and websites to visually represent a person's proficiency in different skills. They provide a quick and easy way for visitors to understand your skillset at a glance. This blog post will guide you through creating visually appealing and informative skill bars using only CSS, without relying on JavaScript.

## Why Use CSS for Skill Bars?

While JavaScript can add dynamic features, using CSS for basic skill bar implementations offers several advantages:

- **Simplicity:** CSS is straightforward and easier to understand for basic bar implementations.
- **Performance:** CSS-only solutions are often more performant than JavaScript-heavy implementations, especially for simple animations.
- **Maintainability:** CSS is declarative, making it easier to maintain and modify the skill bar styles.
- **Accessibility:** With proper ARIA attributes, CSS-only skill bars can be made accessible to users with disabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
- A modern web browser.

## Building a Basic Static Skill Bar

Let's start with the foundation: a static skill bar showing a specific percentage.

**1. HTML Structure:**

```plaintext
<div class="skill-bar">
  <div class="skill-bar-inner" style="width: 80%;">
    <span class="skill-bar-label">HTML</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- `.skill-bar`: The outer container that defines the overall bar appearance.
- `.skill-bar-inner`: The inner bar that represents the skill level, and its width is controlled by inline styling, determining the fill percentage.
- `.skill-bar-label`: The text label indicating the skill name. It's placed inside `.skill-bar-inner` to visually associate the label with the fill level.

**2. CSS Styling:**

```plaintext
.skill-bar {
  width: 100%;
  height: 20px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light grey background */
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hides overflowing content */
  margin-bottom: 10px; /* Spacing between bars */
}

.skill-bar-inner {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green fill color */
  border-radius: 5px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: flex-end; /* Aligns the label to the right */
  padding-right: 10px; /* Adds padding to the right of the label */
  color: white; /* Label text color */
  font-weight: bold; /* Make label text bold */
}

.skill-bar-label {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `.skill-bar`: Sets the width to 100% to fill the available space, defines a height, a light grey background, rounded corners, hides any overflow (ensuring the inner bar stays within the bounds), and adds some bottom margin for spacing.
- `.skill-bar-inner`: Sets the height to 100% to fill the entire bar height, a green background color, rounded corners, uses flexbox to align the label to the right, adds padding to the label, sets the label color to white, and makes the label text bold.

**3. Result:**

This code will create a simple skill bar with a green fill representing 80% for "HTML". You can duplicate this structure and adjust the width and label for other skills.

## Adding Animation to Skill Bars

Let's enhance our skill bars with a smooth animation that gradually fills the bar. We'll achieve this using CSS transitions and keyframes.

**1. Modified HTML (no changes needed):**

The HTML structure remains the same as the static example.

**2. Updated CSS:**

```plaintext
.skill-bar {
  width: 100%;
  height: 20px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.skill-bar-inner {
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  border-radius: 5px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  padding-right: 10px;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
  width: 0; /* Initial width set to 0 */
  transition: width 1s ease-in-out; /* Add a transition */
}

.skill-bar-inner.animate {
  width: attr(data-width); /* Animate to the data-width value */
}


.skill-bar-label {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

**Key Changes:**

- **`width: 0;` in `.skill-bar-inner`:** The inner bar initially has a width of 0. This ensures the animation starts from empty.
- **`transition: width 1s ease-in-out;` in `.skill-bar-inner`:** This line adds a transition to the `width` property. When the width changes, it will animate over 1 second using an "ease-in-out" timing function (smooth start and end).
- **`.skill-bar-inner.animate`**: This CSS class is specifically designed to trigger the animation by dynamically setting the width of the `.skill-bar-inner` element based on the value stored in the `data-width` attribute. The `attr(data-width)` function retrieves the value from the `data-width` attribute of the element and uses it as the new width.

**3. Updated HTML (for animation triggering):**

```plaintext
<div class="skill-bar">
  <div class="skill-bar-inner" data-width="80%">
    <span class="skill-bar-label">HTML</span>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    const skillBars = document.querySelectorAll('.skill-bar-inner')
    skillBars.forEach((bar) => {
      bar.classList.add('animate')
    })
  })
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`data-width="80%"`:** The `data-width` attribute is used to store the desired percentage, the CSS will animate the width to the defined value.
- **JavaScript (added at the end of the `body`):**
  - The script waits for the DOM to be fully loaded using `DOMContentLoaded`.
  - It selects all elements with the class `.skill-bar-inner`.
  - It iterates through each selected skill bar and adds the class `.animate` to it.
  - Adding the `.animate` class triggers the CSS transition defined in `.skill-bar-inner`, causing the bar to animate from a width of 0 to the value specified in its `data-width` attribute.

**How the Animation Works:**

1.  Initially, the `.skill-bar-inner` has a width of `0`.
2.  When the page loads, the JavaScript code adds the class `animate` to `.skill-bar-inner`.
3.  The `animate` class sets the width to the value specified in the `data-width` attribute.
4.  The `transition` property on `.skill-bar-inner` animates the change in width, creating the smooth filling effect.

## Advanced Customization

Here are some ideas to further customize your skill bars:

- **Different Colors:** Use different `background-color` values for each skill to visually differentiate them.
- **Text Labels:** Display the percentage value within the bar using absolute positioning and the `::after` pseudo-element.
- **Gradient Backgrounds:** Use CSS gradients for a more visually appealing fill.
- **Icons:** Include icons before the skill name using the `::before` pseudo-element and font icons or SVGs.
- **ARIA Attributes:** Add ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`) to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Responsiveness:** Use media queries to adjust the bar height and label size for different screen sizes.

## Example: Gradient Background and Percentage Label

```plaintext
.skill-bar-inner {
  /* ... existing styles ... */
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #00bcd4, #009688); /* Gradient background */
  position: relative; /* Required for absolute positioning of the percentage */
}

.skill-bar-inner::after {
  content: attr(data-width); /* Get the percentage from data-width */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 5px;
  color: white;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

In this example, we add a linear gradient background and display the percentage value (obtained from the `data-width` attribute) inside the bar using the `::after` pseudo-element.

## Accessibility Considerations

To make your skill bars accessible:

- Use semantic HTML (e.g., the `<progress>` element can be used for a more semantically correct representation, although styling it can be challenging).
- Add ARIA attributes to provide information to screen readers. For example:

```plaintext
<div class="skill-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" aria-valuenow="80">
  <div class="skill-bar-inner" style="width: 80%;">
    <span class="skill-bar-label">HTML</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

- Ensure sufficient color contrast between the bar and the background.
