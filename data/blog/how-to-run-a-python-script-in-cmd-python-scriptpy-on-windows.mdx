# How to Run a Python Script in CMD (python script.py) on Windows: A Beginner's Guide

Running Python scripts from the command line (CMD) on Windows is a fundamental skill for any Python developer. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to execute Python files using the `python script.py` command, along with troubleshooting tips and best practices. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this tutorial will help you master running Python scripts from the CMD.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into running your Python scripts, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1.  **Python Installation:** You need Python installed on your Windows system.  If you haven't already, download the latest version from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

2.  **Add Python to PATH:** During the Python installation process, *make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"*. This is crucial.  If you missed it, you can modify your system environment variables manually (more on that later).

3.  **A Text Editor or IDE:** You'll need a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and save your Python scripts. Popular options include VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, and Notepad++.  Choose whichever you are most comfortable with.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Running `python script.py` in CMD

Here's how to execute your Python script from the Command Prompt:

**Step 1: Verify Python Installation and Path Configuration**

Open the Command Prompt (CMD).  You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Windows search bar. Type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed correctly and the PATH environment variable is configured properly, you should see the Python version number displayed. For example:

```
Python 3.12.0
```

If you see an error message such as "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file," proceed to the "Troubleshooting: Python Not Recognized" section below.

**Step 2: Create a Simple Python Script**

Open your text editor or IDE and create a new file. Paste the following code into the file:

```python
# my_script.py
print("Hello, world! This is a Python script running from CMD.")

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Save the file as `my_script.py`.  Choose a location you can easily access from the command line, such as your Desktop or a dedicated "PythonScripts" folder.

**Step 3: Navigate to the Script's Directory in CMD**

In the Command Prompt, use the `cd` command (change directory) to navigate to the folder where you saved `my_script.py`.  For example, if you saved the file on your Desktop, you might use:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

If the script is in a folder named "PythonScripts" within your user directory, you might use something like:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\PythonScripts"
```

Replace `YourUsername` with your actual Windows username. Remember to enclose the path in double quotes if it contains spaces.

**Step 4: Execute the Python Script**

Now that you are in the correct directory, you can run your Python script using the following command:

```bash
python my_script.py
```

Press Enter. The script will execute, and you should see the output:

```
Hello, world! This is a Python script running from CMD.
What is your name?
```

The script will then prompt you to enter your name.  Type your name and press Enter. You should see the personalized greeting:

```
Hello, [Your Name]!
```

Congratulations! You have successfully run a Python script from the Command Prompt on Windows.

## Troubleshooting: Python Not Recognized

If you encounter the error message "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file," this means that the Command Prompt cannot find the Python executable. This usually happens if Python's installation directory is not included in your system's PATH environment variable. Here's how to fix it:

**1.  Verify Python Installation Location:**

First, find where Python is installed.  The default location is typically:

`C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312` (Replace 'YourUsername' and 'Python312' with your actual username and Python version).  Also, look for a folder named `Scripts` within that directory. This folder contains `pip.exe` and other important executables.

**2.  Add Python to the PATH Environment Variable:**

   *   **Method 1: Using the Command Line (Temporary Solution):**

       You can temporarily add Python to the PATH for the current CMD session by using the `set` command:

       ```bash
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312;C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts
       ```

       Remember to replace `YourUsername` and `Python312` with your actual values.  This change will only last for the duration of the current CMD session.  When you close and reopen CMD, the PATH will revert to its previous state.

   *   **Method 2: Using System Settings (Permanent Solution):**

       This is the recommended method for a permanent fix.

       a.  Open the System Properties dialog box.  You can do this by searching for "environment variables" in the Windows search bar and clicking "Edit the system environment variables."  Alternatively, you can right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer," select "Properties," then click "Advanced system settings" and finally "Environment Variables."

       b.  In the "System variables" section, scroll down and find the variable named "Path" (or "PATH"). Select it and click "Edit...".

       c.  Click "New" and add the Python installation directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312`).  Repeat this step to add the `Scripts` directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts`).

       d.  Click "OK" on all the dialog boxes to save the changes.

       e.  **Important:** Close and reopen the Command Prompt for the changes to take effect.

**3.  Verify the Fix:**

After making the changes, open a new Command Prompt and run the `python --version` command again.  You should now see the Python version number.

## Best Practices

*   **Use Virtual Environments:** For larger projects, it's highly recommended to use virtual environments. Virtual environments isolate your project's dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects.  The `venv` module is built into Python:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv  # Create a virtual environment named "myenv"
    myenv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
    ```
    When the virtual environment is active, you will see its name at the start of the CMD prompt, for example:  `(myenv) C:\Users\YourUsername\PythonScripts>`.

*   **Write Clear and Readable Code:** Follow Python's PEP 8 style guide for code readability.  Use meaningful variable names and add comments to explain your code.

*   **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Use `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors and handle them appropriately.  This prevents your script from crashing unexpectedly.

*   **Use a Good IDE:** A good IDE can greatly improve your productivity. VS Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text are popular choices with excellent Python support.

## Advanced Tips

*   **Running Scripts with Arguments:** You can pass arguments to your Python script from the command line. These arguments are accessible through the `sys.argv` list.

    ```python
    # script_with_args.py
    import sys

    print("Script name:", sys.argv[0])  # Name of the script
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        for i in range(1, len(sys.argv)):
            print(f"Argument {i}: {sys.argv[i]}")
    else:
        print("No arguments provided.")
    ```

    To run this script with arguments:

    ```bash
    python script_with_args.py arg1 arg2 arg3
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    Script name: script_with_args.py
    Argument 1: arg1
    Argument 2: arg2
    Argument 3: arg3
    ```

*   **Running Scripts in the Background:**  You can run Python scripts in the background using the `start` command:

    ```bash
    start python my_script.py
    ```

    This will launch the script in a new console window and allow you to continue working in the current CMD window.  However, managing the output and potential errors of background processes can be tricky.  Consider using more robust task scheduling tools for complex background tasks.

*   **Using `python3` vs `python`:** On some systems, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python` to execute your script, especially if you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed.  Try `python3 script.py` if `python script.py` doesn't work. However, if you properly set the PATH, you can rename `python3.exe` to `python.exe` if needed (not recommended unless you know what you are doing.)
