# React Toastify: A Comprehensive Guide to Beautiful & Customizable Notifications in React

In the world of web development, providing feedback to users is crucial for a positive user experience. Notifications, often referred to as "toasts," are a non-intrusive way to display important information, alerts, or confirmations without interrupting the user's flow. React Toastify is a powerful and versatile library that makes implementing these notifications in your React applications a breeze.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about React Toastify, from basic installation and usage to advanced customization options. We'll cover various use cases, code examples, and best practices to help you create beautiful and effective notifications that enhance your user interface (UI).

## What is React Toastify?

React Toastify is a React library that allows you to easily add toast notifications to your web applications. It boasts a simple API, a wide range of customization options, and support for themes, animations, and progress bars. Its key features include:

- **Easy Integration:** Quickly add toast notifications to your React components.
- **Highly Customizable:** Control the appearance, position, duration, and behavior of your toasts.
- **Theming Support:** Apply predefined themes or create your own custom styles.
- **Progress Bars:** Visually indicate the remaining time for a toast to disappear.
- **Automatic Updates:** Seamlessly update toast content without interrupting the user.
- **RTL Support:** Right-to-left language support for internationalization.
- **Accessibility:** Built-in accessibility features for users with disabilities.

## Getting Started with React Toastify

Let's dive into the practical steps of implementing React Toastify in your React project.

### 1. Installation

First, you need to install the `react-toastify` package using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install react-toastify
# or
yarn add react-toastify
```

### 2. Importing and Configuring the CSS

Import the necessary CSS file into your main application file (usually `App.js` or `index.js`). This CSS file provides the default styling for the toast notifications.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your application content */}
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The `<ToastContainer />` component is essential. It acts as a container where all your toast notifications will be rendered. You should place it at the root of your application to ensure it's always available.

### 3. Displaying a Simple Toast Notification

Now, let's display a basic success toast notification:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    toast.success('Successfully submitted!')
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Submit</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

In this example, we've imported the `toast` function from `react-toastify`. We've also created a button that, when clicked, triggers the `toast.success()` function. This function displays a success toast notification with the message "Successfully submitted!".

React Toastify provides different toast types for different scenarios:

- `toast.success(message)`: For success messages.
- `toast.error(message)`: For error messages.
- `toast.warn(message)`: For warning messages.
- `toast.info(message)`: For informational messages.
- `toast(message)`: For a generic message.

### 4. Customizing Toast Options

React Toastify offers a wide range of options to customize the appearance and behavior of your toast notifications. You can pass these options as an object to the `toast` function:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    toast.success('Successfully submitted!', {
      position: toast.POSITION.TOP_RIGHT,
      autoClose: 5000, // Close after 5 seconds
      hideProgressBar: false,
      closeOnClick: true,
      pauseOnHover: true,
      draggable: true,
      progress: undefined,
      theme: 'colored',
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Submit</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Here's a breakdown of the common options:

- `position`: The position of the toast notification (e.g., `toast.POSITION.TOP_RIGHT`, `toast.POSITION.BOTTOM_LEFT`, etc.). Available positions are: `TOP_RIGHT`, `TOP_CENTER`, `TOP_LEFT`, `BOTTOM_RIGHT`, `BOTTOM_CENTER`, `BOTTOM_LEFT`.
- `autoClose`: The time (in milliseconds) after which the toast will automatically close. Set to `false` to prevent automatic closing.
- `hideProgressBar`: Whether to hide the progress bar.
- `closeOnClick`: Whether to close the toast when clicked.
- `pauseOnHover`: Whether to pause the autoClose timer when the mouse hovers over the toast.
- `draggable`: Whether the user can drag the toast.
- `progress`: Manually set the progress of the progress bar (0 to 1).
- `theme`: The theme to use for the toast (`light`, `dark`, or `colored`).

### 5. Customizing the ToastContainer

You can also customize the `<ToastContainer />` component to apply global settings to all your toast notifications.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    toast.success('Successfully submitted!')
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Submit</button>
      <ToastContainer
        position="bottom-center"
        autoClose={3000}
        hideProgressBar={true}
        newestOnTop={false}
        closeOnClick
        rtl={false}
        pauseOnFocusLoss
        draggable
        pauseOnHover
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The available props for `<ToastContainer />` are similar to the options you can pass to the `toast` function. Settings defined on the ToastContainer act as defaults that can be overridden by specific toast calls.

### 6. Custom Components as Toasts

One of React Toastify's most powerful features is the ability to use custom React components as toast content. This allows for complete control over the toast's appearance and behavior.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

const CustomToast = ({ closeToast }) => (
  <div>
    This is a custom toast!
    <button onClick={closeToast}>Close</button>
  </div>
)

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    toast(<CustomToast />)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Show Custom Toast</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

In this example:

- We've created a `CustomToast` component that displays a message and a close button.
- We pass this component directly to the `toast()` function.
- The `closeToast` function is automatically passed to your custom component by React Toastify. It's used to programmatically close the toast.

### 7. Updating Toasts

React Toastify allows you to update existing toasts with new content or options. This is useful for providing progress updates or changing the message based on the outcome of an operation.

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [toastId, setToastId] = useState(null)

  const handleButtonClick = async () => {
    setLoading(true)
    const id = toast.loading('Please wait...', { autoClose: false }) // Show loading message

    setToastId(id)

    // Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., API call)
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))

    if (toastId) {
      toast.update(toastId, {
        render: 'Success!',
        type: 'success',
        isLoading: false,
        autoClose: 5000,
      }) // Update to success message
    }

    setLoading(false)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick} disabled={loading}>
        {loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit'}
      </button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Here's what's happening:

- We use `toast.loading()` to display a loading toast. Crucially, we set `autoClose: false` to prevent it from automatically closing. We also save the returned `id` to `toastId`.
- After the asynchronous operation (simulated with `setTimeout`), we use `toast.update(toastId, { ... })` to update the existing toast with new properties:
  - `render`: The new message to display.
  - `type`: The new type of toast (e.g., "success").
  - `isLoading`: Set to `false` to remove the loading spinner.
  - `autoClose`: Set to `5000` to make the success message disappear after 5 seconds.

### 8. Dismissing Toasts Programmatically

You can dismiss toasts programmatically using the `toast.dismiss(toastId)` function. This is useful in scenarios where you need to close a toast based on a specific event or condition.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    const toastId = toast('This toast will disappear in 3 seconds!', { autoClose: 3000 })

    setTimeout(() => {
      toast.dismiss(toastId) // Dismiss after 5 seconds regardless of autohide
    }, 5000)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Show Toast and Dismiss After 5 Seconds</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

In this example, we dismiss the toast after 5 seconds, even though it was set to auto-close after 3 seconds.

## Advanced Customization

React Toastify's customization capabilities extend beyond the basic options. You can leverage CSS styling and themes to create a truly unique look and feel for your notifications.

### 1. Custom CSS Styles

You can apply custom CSS styles to your toast notifications by targeting specific classes. Inspect the HTML of the toasts in your browser's developer tools to identify the classes you want to style.

For example, to change the background color of success toasts:

```plaintext
.Toastify__toast--success {
  background-color: #4caf50; /* Green */
  color: white;
}
```

Remember to import this CSS file or include the styles in your main CSS file.

### 2. Theming

React Toastify offers built-in themes (`light`, `dark`, and `colored`) that provide a consistent look and feel. You can also create your own custom themes by overriding the default CSS styles.

The `theme` prop in the `toast` options and `<ToastContainer />` accepts the value from the set themes.

### 3. Using a Callback to Close Toasts

Sometimes you might want to trigger specific actions when a toast is closed. React-Toastify provides a callback that can be used to achieve this:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    toast.success('Order Placed!', {
      onClose: () => {
        console.log('Toast closed!')
        //You can trigger an action after close here, such as redirecting or refreshing the page
      },
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Place Order</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### 4. Preventing Duplicate Toasts

Displaying duplicate notifications can be frustrating for users. React-Toastify prevents multiple identical notifications from piling up with the `toastId` property. You can check if a particular toastId already exists before creating a new toast.

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify'
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css'

function App() {
  const showToast = () => {
    if (!toast.isActive('my-custom-id')) {
      toast('Hello World !', {
        toastId: 'my-custom-id',
      })
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={showToast}>Show Toast</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
