# Distributed Tracing with Jaeger/Zipkin and FastAPI: A Comprehensive Guide

In the world of microservices, understanding the flow of requests across multiple services can be a daunting task. Traditional debugging methods often fall short when pinpointing the root cause of performance issues or errors that span several services. This is where distributed tracing comes in handy. This guide explores how to implement distributed tracing in your FastAPI applications using popular tracing tools like Jaeger and Zipkin.

## What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing is a method of tracking requests as they propagate through a distributed system. It allows you to visualize the entire journey of a request, from the moment it enters the system to the moment it is processed and returned. This provides valuable insights into performance bottlenecks, error propagation, and dependencies between services.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Trace:** Represents the end-to-end journey of a single request through the system.
- **Span:** Represents a single unit of work within a trace. This could be a function call, a database query, or a network request.
- **Context Propagation:** The mechanism by which trace information is passed between services. This ensures that each span in a trace is correctly associated with the overall request.

## Why Use Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing offers several significant benefits:

- **Improved Observability:** Gain a holistic view of your system's behavior.
- **Faster Debugging:** Quickly identify the source of performance bottlenecks and errors.
- **Enhanced Performance Optimization:** Pinpoint areas where performance can be improved.
- **Better Understanding of Dependencies:** Visualize the relationships between services.
- **Reduced Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR):** Resolve issues more quickly and efficiently.

## Choosing a Tracing Backend: Jaeger vs. Zipkin

Jaeger and Zipkin are two of the most popular open-source distributed tracing systems. Both provide similar functionality, but they have some key differences:

- **Jaeger:** Developed by Uber, known for its UI, ease of deployment, and support for various data storage backends (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, in-memory).
- **Zipkin:** Developed by Twitter, mature, well-established, and supports various storage backends (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, MySQL, in-memory).

For this guide, we'll show examples for both Jaeger and Zipkin, allowing you to choose the tool that best fits your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.7+:** FastAPI requires Python 3.7 or higher.
- **FastAPI:** Install with `pip install fastapi`.
- **Uvicorn:** An ASGI server for running FastAPI applications. Install with `pip install uvicorn`.
- **Opentracing:** A vendor-neutral API for distributed tracing. Install with `pip install opentracing`.
- **Jaeger Client or Zipkin Client:** Depending on your chosen tracing backend:
  - Jaeger: `pip install jaeger-client`
  - Zipkin: `pip install py_zipkin`

## Setting Up Your FastAPI Application

Let's create a simple FastAPI application to demonstrate distributed tracing.

```plaintext
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from opentracing import Tracer, global_tracer
from contextlib import contextmanager
import time

app = FastAPI()

@contextmanager
def start_span(tracer: Tracer, operation_name: str):
    """Helper function to create and manage spans."""
    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name)
    try:
        yield span
    finally:
        span.finish()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root(request: Request):
    tracer = global_tracer()
    with start_span(tracer, "read_root_handler"):
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate some work
        return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, request: Request):
    tracer = global_tracer()
    with start_span(tracer, "read_item_handler"):
        time.sleep(0.2)  # Simulate more work
        with start_span(tracer, "database_query"):
           time.sleep(0.05) #Simulate query
        return {"item_id": item_id}
```

This simple application defines two endpoints: `/` and `/items/{item_id}`. We've added `time.sleep()` calls to simulate work being done in each endpoint. We'll use `opentracing` to create spans around these operations.

## Implementing Tracing with Jaeger

### 1. Install Jaeger Client

```bash
pip install jaeger-client
```

### 2. Configure Jaeger Tracer

Create a function to initialize the Jaeger tracer.

```plaintext
# tracing_jaeger.py
import os
from jaeger_client import Config
from opentracing import global_tracer

def initialize_tracer(service_name: str):
    config = Config(
        config={
            "sampler": {
                "type": "const",
                "param": 1,
            },
            "logging": True,
        },
        service_name=service_name,
    )

    tracer = config.initialize_tracer()
    global_tracer = tracer #Make sure global_tracer is set
    return tracer
```

### 3. Integrate Jaeger into your FastAPI App

Modify your `main.py` file to initialize the Jaeger tracer when the application starts.

```plaintext
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from opentracing import Tracer, global_tracer
from contextlib import contextmanager
import time
from tracing_jaeger import initialize_tracer

app = FastAPI()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    initialize_tracer("my-fastapi-service") # Replace with your service name

@contextmanager
def start_span(tracer: Tracer, operation_name: str):
    """Helper function to create and manage spans."""
    span = tracer.start_span(operation_name)
    try:
        yield span
    finally:
        span.finish()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root(request: Request):
    tracer = global_tracer()
    with start_span(tracer, "read_root_handler"):
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate some work
        return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, request: Request):
    tracer = global_tracer()
    with start_span(tracer, "read_item_handler"):
        time.sleep(0.2)  # Simulate more work
        with start_span(tracer, "database_query"):
           time.sleep(0.05) #Simulate query
        return {"item_id": item_id}
```

### 4. Run Jaeger

You'll need a Jaeger instance running. The easiest way to start one is with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 16686:16686 -p 6831:6831/udp jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

This command starts a Jaeger all-in-one instance, which is suitable for development purposes. The Jaeger UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:16686`.

### 5. Run your FastAPI Application

Start your FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 6. Generate Traffic and View Traces

Send requests to your FastAPI endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
curl http://localhost:8000/items/123
```

Now, open the Jaeger UI in your browser (`http://localhost:16686`) and you should see the traces generated by your application. You can explore the traces to see the spans created for each request, the duration of each span, and any errors that occurred.

## Implementing Tracing with Zipkin

### 1. Install PyZipkin

```bash
pip install py_zipkin
```

### 2. Configure Zipkin Tracer

Create a function to initialize the Zipkin tracer.

```plaintext
# tracing_zipkin.py
import os
from py_zipkin.zipkin import ZipkinAttrs, create_http_transport, zipkin_span
from py_zipkin.thread_local import get_zipkin_attrs, set_zipkin_attrs
from opentracing import Tracer, global_tracer
from functools import wraps
import socket

def initialize_tracer(service_name: str, host: str = 'localhost', port: int = 9411):
    """Initialize the Zipkin tracer."""

    def report(span):
        json_list = [span]
        body = b'[' + b','.join(json_list) + b']'
        transport("POST", "/api/v2/spans", body, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})

    transport = create_http_transport(f'http://{host}:{port}/api/v2/spans')

    tracer = Tracer()  # You might need to implement a no-op Tracer if opentracing isn't used

    global_tracer = tracer #Make sure global_tracer is set

    return tracer

def zipkin_trace(service_name, sample_rate=100.0):
    """A decorator to trace function calls using Zipkin."""
    def wrapper(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
            zipkin_attrs = get_zipkin_attrs()
            if zipkin_attrs is None:
                zipkin_attrs = ZipkinAttrs(trace_id=None, span_id=None, parent_span_id=None, flags='1', is_sampled=True)

            with zipkin_span(
                service_name=service_name,
                span_name=func.__name__,
                zipkin_attrs=zipkin_attrs,
                transport_handler=create_http_transport(f'http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans'), # Hardcoded here as example
                sample_rate=sample_rate,
            ):
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        return wrapped
    return wrapper
```

### 3. Integrate Zipkin into your FastAPI App

Modify your `main.py` file to initialize the Zipkin tracer when the application starts. Note that Zipkin uses decorators to wrap functions to trace.

```plaintext
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from opentracing import Tracer, global_tracer
from contextlib import contextmanager
import time
from tracing_zipkin import initialize_tracer, zipkin_trace

app = FastAPI()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    initialize_tracer("my-fastapi-service") # Replace with your service name

@app.get("/")
@zipkin_trace("my-fastapi-service")
async def read_root(request: Request):
    time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate some work
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
@zipkin_trace("my-fastapi-service")
async def read_item(item_id: int, request: Request):
    time.sleep(0.2)  # Simulate more work
    time.sleep(0.05) #Simulate query
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

### 4. Run Zipkin

You'll need a Zipkin instance running. The easiest way to start one is with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

This command starts a Zipkin instance. The Zipkin UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:9411`.

### 5. Run your FastAPI Application

Start your FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 6. Generate Traffic and View Traces

Send requests to your FastAPI endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
curl http://localhost:8000/items/123
```

Now, open the Zipkin UI in your browser (`http://localhost:9411`) and you should see the traces generated by your application. You can explore the traces to see the spans created for each request.

## Advanced Configuration and Customization

- **Sampling:** Control the percentage of requests that are traced. This is important for production environments to reduce the overhead of tracing. Jaeger and Zipkin both offer various sampling strategies.
- **Adding Tags and Logs:** Add custom tags and logs to spans to provide more context.
- **Error Handling:** Capture and report errors that occur within spans. This helps to pinpoint the root cause of failures.
- **Correlation IDs:** Use correlation IDs to track requests across multiple services that are not directly related through tracing.

## Conclusion

Distributed tracing is an invaluable tool for understanding and debugging microservices architectures. By integrating Jaeger or Zipkin into your FastAPI applications, you can gain deep insights into the behavior of your system, identify performance bottlenecks, and resolve issues more quickly. This guide provides a solid foundation for implementing distributed tracing in your FastAPI projects. Remember to explore the advanced configuration options to tailor the tracing to your specific needs.
