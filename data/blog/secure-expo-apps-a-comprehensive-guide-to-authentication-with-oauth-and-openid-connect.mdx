# Secure Expo Apps: A Comprehensive Guide to Authentication with OAuth and OpenID Connect

In today's mobile-first world, secure user authentication is paramount for any application. Expo, a popular framework for building React Native apps, makes cross-platform development easier, but securing your Expo apps remains crucial. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of implementing authentication using OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers, such as Google, Facebook, and Auth0, in your Expo applications.

## Why OAuth and OpenID Connect?

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand why OAuth and OIDC are essential for modern authentication:

- **OAuth (Open Authorization):** OAuth enables your application to access user resources hosted by another service (e.g., Google Photos, Facebook profile) without needing the user's credentials directly. It grants _limited_ access, allowing users to control what your app can access.

- **OpenID Connect (OIDC):** Built on top of OAuth 2.0, OIDC adds an _identity layer_. It allows your application to verify the identity of the user by retrieving basic profile information, like their name and email, through a standardized format called an ID Token. Think of it as OAuth + user identity.

**Benefits of using OAuth/OIDC:**

- **Enhanced Security:** Your application never directly handles sensitive user credentials like passwords.
- **Improved User Experience:** Users can log in with accounts they already use, streamlining the signup process.
- **Delegated Access Control:** Users can granularly control what information and actions your application can access on their behalf.
- **Industry Standard:** OAuth and OIDC are widely adopted and well-understood, ensuring interoperability and security best practices.

## Setting up your Expo Project

First, ensure you have a working Expo project. If not, create one:

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app my-auth-app
cd my-auth-app
```

## Choosing an OAuth/OIDC Provider

The first step is to choose the authentication provider you want to integrate with. Popular options include:

- **Google:** Widely used, offers seamless integration with Google accounts.
- **Facebook:** Another common choice, especially if your target audience is active on Facebook.
- **Auth0:** A comprehensive authentication platform that supports various identity providers and advanced features like multi-factor authentication.
- **Okta:** Similar to Auth0, offering robust identity and access management solutions.

For this guide, we'll focus on integrating with **Google** as it's a popular and straightforward option. The general principles apply to other providers, though the specific configuration steps might differ.

## Configuring Google Sign-In

1.  **Create a Google Cloud Project:** Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable the Google Sign-In API:** Search for "Google Sign-In API" and enable it.
3.  **Configure OAuth 2.0 Credentials:** Go to "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth client ID."

    - **Application Type:** Select "iOS" or "Android" based on your target platform, or "Web application" if you intend to use server-side flow.

      - **iOS:** Enter your app's Bundle ID (e.g., `com.example.myapp`). You can find this in your `app.json` file under `expo.ios.bundleIdentifier`.
      - **Android:** You'll need to provide the package name and signing certificate fingerprint (SHA-1). The package name is in your `app.json` under `expo.android.package`. To get the SHA-1 fingerprint, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```plaintext
        keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
        ```

        (If you're using a different keystore, adjust the command accordingly.)

    - **Web Application:** Use this if you want to handle the authentication on your server. You will need to set up "Authorized JavaScript origins" and "Authorized redirect URIs". For development, `http://localhost:19006` often works for the redirect URI.

4.  **Note the Client ID:** Once you've created the credentials, copy the "Client ID." You'll need this in your Expo app.

## Installing Required Packages

Install the necessary Expo modules:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-auth-session expo-crypto expo-random
```

- `expo-auth-session`: Provides the core functionality for handling OAuth flows in Expo.
- `expo-crypto`: Offers cryptographic functions, including generating random values for state management.
- `expo-random`: Provides a secure random number generator.

## Implementing the Authentication Flow

Here's the code for implementing the authentication flow with Google in your Expo app:

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, View, Text, Alert } from 'react-native'
import * as AuthSession from 'expo-auth-session'
import * as Crypto from 'expo-crypto'
import * as Random from 'expo-random'
import { Platform } from 'react-native'

// Replace with your actual Client ID
const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com'

// IMPORTANT:  This MUST MATCH the redirect URI configured in your Google Cloud Console.
// If running on Expo Go, it will generally use exp://localhost:19000 or exp://192.168.x.x:19000, depending on your network.
// When building a standalone app, it will be a deep link specific to your app's bundle ID.
const REDIRECT_URI = AuthSession.makeRedirectUri({ scheme: 'your-app-scheme' }) // Replace 'your-app-scheme'
// Determine your scheme: For Expo Go, it's usually 'exp'. For standalone apps, it's what's defined in your app.json.
// For Expo Go, if you are building from eas, you can also use the `expo-router` package to use an expo router scheme.
// For example: import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';  const router = useRouter(); const redirectUri = router.resolve('/auth/callback')
// You can find the full documentation here: https://expo.github.io/router/reference/use-router/

const discovery = {
  authorizationEndpoint: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth',
  tokenEndpoint: 'https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token',
  revocationEndpoint: 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke',
}

export default function App() {
  const [request, response, promptAsync] = AuthSession.useAuthRequest(
    {
      clientId: CLIENT_ID,
      redirectUri: REDIRECT_URI,
      scopes: ['profile', 'email'], // Request user profile and email
      extraParams: {
        prompt: 'consent', // Always show the consent screen
      },
    },
    discovery
  )

  const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResponse = async () => {
      if (response?.type === 'success') {
        const { authentication } = response
        getUserInfo(authentication.accessToken)
      }
    }

    handleResponse()
  }, [response])

  const getUserInfo = async (accessToken) => {
    try {
      const userInfoResponse = await fetch('https://www.googleapis.com/userinfo/v2/me', {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` },
      })

      if (!userInfoResponse.ok) {
        console.error(
          'Failed to fetch user info:',
          userInfoResponse.status,
          userInfoResponse.statusText
        )
        Alert.alert('Error fetching user info', 'Please try again later.')
        return
      }

      const user = await userInfoResponse.json()
      setUserInfo(user)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching user info:', error)
      Alert.alert(
        'Error fetching user info',
        'Please check your internet connection or try again later.'
      )
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      {userInfo ? (
        <View>
          <Text>Welcome, {userInfo.name}!</Text>
          <Text>Email: {userInfo.email}</Text>
          <Text>ID: {userInfo.id}</Text>
          {userInfo.picture && (
            <Image source={{ uri: userInfo.picture }} style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }} />
          )}
        </View>
      ) : (
        <Button
          disabled={!request}
          title="Login with Google"
          onPress={() => {
            promptAsync()
          }}
        />
      )}
    </View>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Import Necessary Modules:** Import the required modules from `expo-auth-session`, `expo-crypto`, and `react-native`.
- **Configuration:** Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Google Client ID. **Crucially, update the `REDIRECT_URI`** with the correct URI. For Expo Go, this usually is `exp://localhost:19006` or a similar `exp://` address. For standalone apps, it's a deep link like `yourapp://redirect`. _Double-check your `app.json` and Google Cloud Console settings to ensure they match!_
- **`useAuthRequest` Hook:** This hook from `expo-auth-session` manages the authentication request.
  - `clientId`: Your Google Client ID.
  - `redirectUri`: The URI Google redirects to after authentication. **This is case-sensitive and _must_ match the URI configured in your Google Cloud Console.**
  - `scopes`: Defines the permissions your app is requesting (e.g., `profile`, `email`).
  - `discovery`: An object containing the OAuth/OIDC endpoints for Google.
  - `extraParams: { prompt: 'consent'}`: Forces the consent screen to always be shown to the user (useful for testing and development). Remove this in production if you don't want the consent screen to appear every time.
- **`promptAsync` Function:** Calls the authentication flow when the "Login with Google" button is pressed.
- **Handling the Response:** The `useEffect` hook listens for changes to the `response` object. If the authentication is successful (`response?.type === 'success'`), it extracts the access token and calls the `getUserInfo` function.
- **`getUserInfo` Function:** Fetches user profile information from the Google User Info endpoint using the access token.
- **Displaying User Information:** If `userInfo` is available, it displays the user's name and email.
- **Button:** Disables the button if the authentication request hasn't been initialized yet.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Redirect URI:** The redirect URI is **absolutely critical**. Make sure it matches the URI configured in your Google Cloud Console **exactly**, including the scheme (`exp://`, `https://`, etc.) and any trailing slashes. Incorrect redirect URIs are the most common cause of authentication failures.
- **Scheme:** The `scheme` in `AuthSession.makeRedirectUri({ scheme: 'your-app-scheme' })` is what identifies your application to the operating system and allows the browser to redirect back to your app. This should be the same value defined in your `app.json` under `expo.scheme` (for standalone apps). For Expo Go, it's typically `exp`.
- **Development vs. Production:** The redirect URI will likely be different in development (using Expo Go) and production (standalone app). You'll need to handle this dynamically, perhaps using environment variables or a configuration file.

## Securing the Access Token

Storing the access token securely is crucial. Here are some options:

- **`expo-secure-store`:** A secure storage solution for storing sensitive data like access tokens on the device.
- **Keychain (iOS) / Keystore (Android):** Native platform-specific secure storage mechanisms. `expo-secure-store` abstracts away the complexities of using these directly.
- **Server-Side Session Management:** The most secure option. After the initial authentication, exchange the access token for a server-side session token. This avoids storing the access token on the device altogether.

Here's an example of using `expo-secure-store`:

```plaintext
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store'

// Store the access token
async function saveAccessToken(accessToken) {
  await SecureStore.setItemAsync('accessToken', accessToken)
}

// Retrieve the access token
async function getAccessToken() {
  return await SecureStore.getItemAsync('accessToken')
}

// Delete the access token when the user logs out
async function deleteAccessToken() {
  await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('accessToken')
}
```

Remember to call `saveAccessToken` after a successful authentication and `deleteAccessToken` when the user logs out. Use `getAccessToken` to retrieve the token when needed to access protected resources.

## Implementing Logout

A logout function is also essential. This typically involves revoking the access token (if the provider supports it) and clearing the user's session.

```plaintext
const logout = async () => {
  if (accessToken) {
    try {
      // Attempt to revoke the token (not always supported by all providers)
      await fetch(`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke?token=${accessToken}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        },
      })
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error revoking token:', error)
      // Token revocation is optional; continue with local logout even if it fails
    }
  }

  // Clear local user data and access token
  setUserInfo(null)
  await deleteAccessToken() // Use the function from expo-secure-store
}
```

## Best Practices and Security Considerations

- **Validate Access Tokens:** Always validate access tokens on your server to ensure they haven't been tampered with or revoked.
- **Use HTTPS:** Ensure all communication between your app and your server is encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Implement Refresh Tokens:** Use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate. Handle refresh tokens securely.
- **Protect Against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** If you're using a server-side flow, implement CSRF protection.
- **Follow Provider Guidelines:** Adhere to the specific security recommendations and best practices of your chosen OAuth/OIDC provider.
- **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep your Expo and related packages updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a solid foundation for implementing secure authentication in your Expo applications using OAuth and OpenID Connect. By following these steps and best practices, you can create a secure and user-friendly authentication experience for your users. Remember to tailor the implementation to your specific needs and always prioritize security. Remember to thoroughly test your implementation on both iOS and Android to ensure compatibility and a smooth user experience. Good luck!
