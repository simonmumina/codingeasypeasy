## The Best Math YouTube Channels

Here's a curated list of top-notch math YouTube channels, categorized by subject area and learning style:

### 1. 3Blue1Brown (Essence of Linear Algebra/Calculus)

**Focus:** Visual and intuitive explanations of complex mathematical concepts, primarily linear algebra and calculus.

**Why it's great:** Grant Sanderson, the creator of 3Blue1Brown, is a master of visual storytelling. His videos are stunningly animated and provide deep conceptual understanding, rather than just rote memorization. This channel truly helps you _understand_ the "why" behind the math.

**Example:**

Consider this code snippet (although 3Blue1Brown doesn't typically use code in their videos, we can represent a linear transformation with code):

```plaintext
import numpy as np

# Define a linear transformation matrix (rotation by 45 degrees)
theta = np.pi / 4  # 45 degrees in radians
rotation_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta)],
                            [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta)]])

# Apply the transformation to a vector
vector = np.array([1, 0])
transformed_vector = np.dot(rotation_matrix, vector)

print(f"Original vector: {vector}")
print(f"Transformed vector: {transformed_vector}")
```

3Blue1Brown would visually demonstrate this transformation, showing how the vector rotates in the plane. This visual understanding is far more impactful than just memorizing the formula.

**Best for:** Visual learners, anyone wanting a deep understanding of the "why" behind mathematical concepts, those studying linear algebra or calculus.
