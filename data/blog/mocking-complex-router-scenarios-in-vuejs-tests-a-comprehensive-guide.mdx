# Mocking Complex Router Scenarios in Vue.js Tests: A Comprehensive Guide

Testing Vue.js components that rely heavily on `vue-router` can be challenging.  The router's behavior, especially in complex scenarios, needs to be accurately simulated to achieve reliable and predictable test results. This guide will walk you through various techniques for mocking complex router interactions in your Vue.js tests, allowing you to write robust and maintainable tests.

## Why Mock the Router?

When testing a Vue.js component that interacts with the router, it's crucial to isolate the component's logic from the actual routing implementation.  This isolation provides several benefits:

*   **Speed:** Mocking is significantly faster than navigating real routes during tests.
*   **Isolation:** It prevents tests from being affected by external factors like the router configuration or other components.
*   **Predictability:** It ensures that tests focus solely on the component being tested, making them more reliable and easier to debug.
*   **Control:** Mocking allows you to control the router's behavior, simulating different scenarios and edge cases.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Vue.js:** (Version 2 or 3)
*   **Vue Router:**  The official Vue.js router.
*   **Jest/Vitest/Mocha/Cypress (or any other testing framework):**  Choose your preferred testing framework.  This guide uses Jest for illustrative purposes.
*   **Vue Test Utils (for Vue 2) or @vue/test-utils (for Vue 3):** The official testing utility library for Vue.js.

## Basic Mocking Techniques

The most straightforward approach is to replace the `vue-router` instance with a mock object. This allows you to control its properties and methods directly.

### 1. Mocking the `$route` Object

The `$route` object contains information about the current route, such as the path, parameters, and query parameters.  You can mock it by providing a simple object with the properties you need.

```javascript
// ComponentToTest.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>User ID: {{ userId }}</p>
    <p>Path: {{ currentPath }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    userId() {
      return this.$route.params.id;
    },
    currentPath() {
      return this.$route.path;
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

```javascript
// ComponentToTest.spec.js (Jest example)
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import ComponentToTest from './ComponentToTest.vue';

describe('ComponentToTest', () => {
  it('renders the user ID from the route params', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(ComponentToTest, {
      mocks: {
        $route: {
          params: { id: '123' },
          path: '/users/123'
        }
      }
    });

    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('User ID: 123');
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Path: /users/123');
  });
});
```

In this example, we're using `mocks` in `mount` options to inject a mocked `$route` object with predefined `params` and `path` values.

### 2. Mocking the `$router` Object

The `$router` object provides methods for navigating and manipulating the router's history.  To mock it, you can create an object with the methods you need to test, such as `push`, `replace`, and `go`.

```javascript
// ComponentWithNavigation.vue
<template>
  <button @click="goToHome">Go to Home</button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    goToHome() {
      this.$router.push('/');
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

```javascript
// ComponentWithNavigation.spec.js (Jest example)
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import ComponentWithNavigation from './ComponentWithNavigation.vue';

describe('ComponentWithNavigation', () => {
  it('calls $router.push with the correct path when the button is clicked', async () => {
    const push = jest.fn(); // Create a Jest mock function

    const wrapper = mount(ComponentWithNavigation, {
      mocks: {
        $router: {
          push
        }
      }
    });

    await wrapper.find('button').trigger('click');

    expect(push).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/');
  });
});
```

Here, we're using a Jest mock function (`jest.fn()`) to track whether `$router.push` is called and with what arguments. This verifies that the component correctly navigates to the home route.

## Mocking Complex Scenarios

Now, let's delve into more complex scenarios that require a more sophisticated mocking approach.

### 1. Mocking Route Parameters

Often, your components rely on dynamic route parameters. Let's look at how to mock this effectively.

```vue
// UserProfile.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>User Profile</h1>
    <p>User ID: {{ userId }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    userId() {
      return this.$route.params.userId;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

```javascript
// UserProfile.spec.js
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import UserProfile from './UserProfile.vue';

describe('UserProfile', () => {
  it('displays the user ID from route params', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(UserProfile, {
      mocks: {
        $route: {
          params: { userId: '42' },
        },
      },
    });

    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('User ID: 42');
  });
});
```

We inject the mock `$route` object with the `params` property set to an object containing `userId`.  This isolates the component from the actual router configuration, allowing us to test the component's behavior with different user IDs.

### 2. Mocking Query Parameters

Components often need to access query parameters. Hereâ€™s how to mock them.

```vue
// SearchResults.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Search Results</h1>
    <p>Query: {{ searchQuery }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    searchQuery() {
      return this.$route.query.q;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

```javascript
// SearchResults.spec.js
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import SearchResults from './SearchResults.vue';

describe('SearchResults', () => {
  it('displays the search query from route query', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(SearchResults, {
      mocks: {
        $route: {
          query: { q: 'vue testing' },
        },
      },
    });

    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Query: vue testing');
  });
});
```

Similar to route parameters, we inject the `$route` object with a `query` property. This enables testing the component's behavior based on different search queries.

### 3. Mocking Navigation Guards (beforeEach, afterEach)

Navigation guards are functions that are executed before or after a route is navigated to. They are commonly used for authentication, authorization, and data fetching. Mocking them requires a slightly more advanced approach.

```javascript
// router.js (Simplified example)
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/admin',
    component: () => import('./AdminPage.vue'),
    meta: { requiresAuth: true },
  },
  {
    path: '/',
    component: () => import('./HomePage.vue'),
  }
];

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes,
});

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  if (to.matched.some(record => record.meta.requiresAuth)) {
    // Check if user is authenticated
    if (!isAuthenticated()) {
      next({
        path: '/login',
        query: { redirect: to.fullPath },
      });
    } else {
      next();
    }
  } else {
    next(); // Make sure to always call next()!
  }
});

function isAuthenticated() {
  // In a real application, this would check for a token or session
  return false; // Simulate not being authenticated
}

export default router;
```

Let's test a component that relies on the authentication guard.

```vue
// AdminPage.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Admin Page</h1>
    <p>Welcome, Admin!</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

```javascript
// AdminPage.spec.js
import { shallowMount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import AdminPage from './AdminPage.vue';

describe('AdminPage', () => {
  it('renders the AdminPage component if authenticated', () => {
    const localVue = createLocalVue();
    localVue.use(VueRouter);

    const router = new VueRouter();

    // Simulate authentication
    const originalBeforeEach = router.beforeEach; // store original
    router.beforeEach = (to, from, next) => {
      next();  //bypass the auth check for this test.
    }

    const wrapper = shallowMount(AdminPage, {
      localVue,
      router,
    });

    // Restore original beforeEach for other tests.
    router.beforeEach = originalBeforeEach;

    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Admin Page');
  });

  it('does not render the AdminPage component if not authenticated (redirected)', () => {
      const localVue = createLocalVue();
      localVue.use(VueRouter);

      const router = new VueRouter();

      let nextCalledWith = null;

      // Simulate authentication failure.
      const originalBeforeEach = router.beforeEach;
      router.beforeEach = (to, from, next) => {
          nextCalledWith = { path: to.path, query: to.query };
      }
      const wrapper = shallowMount(AdminPage, {
          localVue,
          router,
      });

      router.beforeEach = originalBeforeEach;

      // The assertion for redirection should be performed during the route guard
      expect(nextCalledWith).toBeNull(); // Ensure guard was triggered.
  });
});
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We create a local Vue instance and install `vue-router` using `createLocalVue()`.  This prevents conflicts with the global Vue instance.
2.  We create a new `VueRouter` instance and mock the `beforeEach` method. By overwriting `router.beforeEach` we have control over the execution path.
3.  In the first test case we bypass the authentication check by always calling `next()` thus simulating that the component is rendered.
4. In the second test case we capture what the `next` function of the `beforeEach` function gets called with and assert it is the `path` and `query` parameters of the redirected route.
5.  Finally, we restore the original `beforeEach` for other tests to work correctly, avoiding side effects.

### 4. Mocking Named Routes

Named routes are a convenient way to refer to routes by name instead of by their path.

```javascript
// router.js
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/profile/:id',
    name: 'profile',
    component: () => import('./ProfilePage.vue'),
  },
];

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes,
});

export default router;
```

```vue
// ProfileLink.vue
<template>
  <router-link :to="{ name: 'profile', params: { id: userId } }">
    View Profile
  </router-link>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    userId: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

```javascript
// ProfileLink.spec.js
import { mount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import ProfileLink from './ProfileLink.vue';

describe('ProfileLink', () => {
  it('generates the correct link to the profile page', () => {
    const localVue = createLocalVue();
    localVue.use(VueRouter);

    const router = new VueRouter();
    const wrapper = mount(ProfileLink, {
      localVue,
      router,
      propsData: {
        userId: '123',
      },
    });

    expect(wrapper.find('a').attributes('href')).toBe('/profile/123');
  });
});
```

In this case, because we are mounting a `<router-link>` we need to include the router instance in the `mount` options in addition to having Vue use the Router plugin. If the router instance isn't provided vue-test-utils will display a warning that the router isn't installed.

### 5. Dynamic Route Matching (Catch-All Routes)

Catch-all routes (e.g., `/*`) allow you to handle unmatched routes, often used for 404 pages. Mocking them involves testing the behavior when an invalid route is accessed.

```javascript
// router.js
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [
    {
        path: '*',
        component: () => import('./NotFound.vue') //Not found component
    }
];

const router = new VueRouter({
    routes
});

export default router;
```

```vue
//NotFound.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>404 - Not Found</h1>
    <p>Sorry, the page you're looking for doesn't exist.</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

```javascript
//NotFound.spec.js
import { mount, createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import NotFound from './NotFound.vue';

describe('NotFound', () => {
    it('renders the NotFound component', () => {
        const localVue = createLocalVue();
        localVue.use(VueRouter);

        const router = new VueRouter({ mode: 'abstract' });  //Use abstract mode
        router.push('/nonexistent'); //Push a route that doesn't exist

        const wrapper = mount(NotFound, {
            localVue,
            router
        });

        expect(wrapper.text()).toContain("404 - Not Found");
    });
});
```

**Explanation:**

* We create a `VueRouter` instance with `mode: 'abstract'`. This prevents the router from actually navigating in the browser and allows you to control its state programmatically.
* We programmatically push a route that doesn't exist (`/nonexistent`) to trigger the catch-all route.
* We then mount the `NotFound` component and assert that it renders correctly.

## Best Practices for Mocking Routers in Tests

*   **Keep mocks simple:** Avoid over-complicating your mocks. Focus on mocking only the parts of the router that are relevant to the component being tested.
*   **Use descriptive names:** Name your mocks clearly to indicate what they are mocking.  For example, `$routeMock` or `$routerPushMock`.
*   **Restore mocks:** If you're modifying the global `vue-router` instance, be sure to restore it to its original state after the test to avoid side effects.
*   **Choose the right testing strategy:** Unit tests are suitable for isolated component logic, while integration tests are better for testing interactions between components and the router.
*   **Document your mocks:**  Add comments to explain the purpose of each mock, making it easier for others to understand and maintain your tests.
*   **Avoid mocking the router entirely if possible:** Consider using a real router instance in integration tests to ensure that the routing configuration is correct.  Mocking should primarily be used in unit tests to isolate the component being tested.

## Conclusion

Mocking the `vue-router` in your tests is essential for writing reliable and maintainable Vue.js applications.  By using the techniques outlined in this guide, you can effectively isolate your components, control the router's behavior, and ensure that your tests accurately reflect the component's functionality.  Remember to choose the appropriate mocking strategy based on the complexity of the router interactions and the scope of your tests.  With practice, you'll become proficient at mocking even the most intricate router scenarios, leading to more robust and confident development.
