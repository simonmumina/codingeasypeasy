# CI/CD for NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide to Automated Builds, Testing, and Deployment

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential practices in modern software development. They enable teams to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, leading to faster release cycles, fewer bugs, and improved overall software quality. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your NestJS application using popular tools and platforms.

## What is CI/CD and Why Use It for NestJS?

CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operations teams by automating the software release process.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers regularly integrate their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. This helps identify integration issues early and ensures that the codebase remains stable.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** The automated release of code changes to production. CD automates the entire software release process, from code commit to deployment, making releases faster, more reliable, and less prone to errors.

**Benefits of CI/CD for NestJS:**

- **Faster Release Cycles:** Automate the entire deployment process, enabling more frequent and smaller releases.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Automated testing catches bugs early in the development lifecycle, leading to higher quality code.
- **Reduced Risk:** Automated deployments minimize human error and make it easier to roll back changes if necessary.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Free up developers from repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on writing code.
- **Scalability:** CI/CD pipelines can handle the increasing complexity of modern applications, ensuring that deployments remain reliable and efficient.

## Choosing the Right CI/CD Tools

Several CI/CD platforms are available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular choices include:

- **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub repositories. It's a great choice if your project is hosted on GitHub. It's easy to set up and offers a generous free tier.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** A comprehensive CI/CD platform integrated within GitLab. Similar to GitHub Actions, it's ideal for projects hosted on GitLab and offers powerful features.
- **Jenkins:** A highly customizable open-source CI/CD server. It's very flexible and can be integrated with a wide range of tools, but requires more setup and maintenance.
- **CircleCI:** A cloud-based CI/CD platform known for its ease of use and speed.
- **Travis CI:** Another cloud-based CI/CD platform, particularly popular for open-source projects.

For this guide, we'll focus primarily on using **GitHub Actions** due to its tight integration with GitHub and relative ease of setup. However, the principles and concepts are transferable to other CI/CD platforms. We will also provide a brief example of how to achieve similar results with GitLab CI/CD.

## Prerequisites

- A NestJS application (You can create one using the Nest CLI: `nest new my-nestjs-app`)
- A GitHub repository for your NestJS application
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed locally
- A basic understanding of Docker (optional, but highly recommended)

## Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

1.  **Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository's root.**

    This directory will contain your workflow configuration files.

2.  **Create a YAML file (e.g., `ci-cd.yml`) within the `.github/workflows` directory.**

    This file will define the steps in your CI/CD pipeline.

3.  **Define the workflow:**

    Here's a basic example of a `ci-cd.yml` file for a NestJS application:

    ```plaintext
    name: NestJS CI/CD

    on:
      push:
        branches: ['main'] # Trigger workflow on push to the main branch
      pull_request:
        branches: ['main'] # Trigger workflow on pull requests to the main branch

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Checkout the repository
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: '18' # Or your preferred Node.js version

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install # Or yarn install

          - name: Run tests
            run: npm run test:cov # Or yarn test:cov (assuming you have a test coverage script)

          - name: Build application
            run: npm run build # Or yarn build

          - name: Upload Artifact
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
            with:
              name: dist
              path: dist
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    - `name`: The name of the workflow.
    - `on`: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. In this case, it's triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
    - `jobs`: Defines the tasks that the workflow will perform. In this case, we have a single job called `build`.
    - `runs-on`: Specifies the operating system that the job will run on. `ubuntu-latest` is a good default choice.
    - `steps`: A list of steps to be executed in the job.
      - `actions/checkout@v3`: Checks out the repository code.
      - `actions/setup-node@v3`: Sets up Node.js.
      - `npm install`: Installs the project dependencies.
      - `npm run test:cov`: Runs the tests and generates coverage reports. **Important:** Make sure you have a `test:cov` script defined in your `package.json`. For example: `"test:cov": "jest --coverage"`
      - `npm run build`: Builds the NestJS application. **Important:** Make sure you have a `build` script defined in your `package.json`. For example: `"build": "nest build"`
      - `actions/upload-artifact@v3`: Uploads the build artifact (the `dist` folder) to GitHub Actions for later use (e.g., in a deployment job).

4.  **Commit and push the `ci-cd.yml` file to your GitHub repository.**

    This will trigger the workflow automatically on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.

5.  **Monitor the workflow:**

    Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of your workflow. You can see the status of each step and view logs to troubleshoot any issues.

## Adding a Deployment Job (Continuous Deployment)

The previous example only builds and tests the application. To deploy the application, you'll need to add another job to your workflow. The deployment job will depend on the environment you're deploying to. Here are some common deployment scenarios and examples:

### 1. Deploying to Heroku

Heroku is a popular platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that simplifies application deployment.

```plaintext
name: NestJS CI/CD to Heroku

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:cov
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: build # Deploy job depends on the build job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Heroku
        uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12
        with:
          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}} # Store your Heroku API key in GitHub secrets
          heroku_app_name: your-heroku-app-name # Replace with your Heroku app name
          heroku_email: your-heroku-email@example.com # Replace with your Heroku email
```

**Explanation:**

- `needs: build`: Specifies that the `deploy` job depends on the `build` job. This ensures that the build job completes successfully before the deployment job starts.
- `akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12`: Uses the Heroku Deploy GitHub Action.
- `heroku_api_key`: Your Heroku API key, stored as a secret in GitHub Actions (see below).
- `heroku_app_name`: The name of your Heroku application.
- `heroku_email`: The email address associated with your Heroku account.

**Important:**

- **Store your Heroku API key as a secret in GitHub Actions:** Go to your repository's "Settings" tab, then "Secrets," and add a new secret named `HEROKU_API_KEY`.
- **Replace `your-heroku-app-name` and `your-heroku-email@example.com` with your actual Heroku application name and email address.**

### 2. Deploying to a Docker Container

Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container, making it easy to deploy to any environment that supports Docker.

**a. Create a `Dockerfile`:**

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your NestJS project:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --production # Only install production dependencies

COPY . .

ARG NODE_ENV=production
ENV NODE_ENV=$NODE_ENV

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "node", "dist/main.js" ]
```

**b. Update your CI/CD workflow (`ci-cd.yml`):**

```plaintext
name: NestJS CI/CD with Docker

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:cov
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: .
          push: false # Set to true to push to a registry like Docker Hub
          tags: your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:latest # Replace with your Docker Hub username and app name
```

**Explanation:**

- `docker/build-push-action@v3`: Uses the Docker Build and Push Action.
- `context`: The path to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`.
- `push`: Set to `true` to push the image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub). You'll need to configure Docker Hub credentials in GitHub Secrets if you want to push the image.
- `tags`: The tag for the Docker image. Replace `your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:latest` with your actual Docker Hub username and app name.

**c. (Optional) Push to Docker Hub:**

To push the image to Docker Hub, you'll need to add Docker Hub credentials to your GitHub Secrets:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token (create one in your Docker Hub account settings).

Update your `deploy` job in `ci-cd.yml` to include the login step:

```plaintext
deploy:
  needs: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}}
        password: ${{secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN}}
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
      with:
        context: .
        push: true # Now set to true
        tags: your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name:latest
```

**d. Deploy the Docker Container:**

After pushing the image to a registry like Docker Hub, you can deploy it to various platforms, such as:

- **Docker Swarm:** A container orchestration platform built into Docker.
- **Kubernetes:** A more advanced container orchestration platform.
- **AWS ECS:** Amazon Elastic Container Service.
- **Google Cloud Run:** Google's serverless container platform.
- **Azure Container Instances:** Microsoft's serverless container platform.

The specific steps for deploying to these platforms will vary depending on the platform you choose. You'll typically need to create a deployment configuration file that specifies the image to use, the resources to allocate, and other deployment settings. You can then add steps to your `deploy` job to apply this configuration to your chosen platform. For example using `kubectl` to apply a kubernetes deployment manifest.

### 3. Deploying with PM2

PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It allows you to easily start, stop, and manage your application.

**a. Install PM2:**

Add PM2 as a dependency to your NestJS project:

```plaintext
npm install pm2 -g
```

**b. Create a PM2 configuration file (`ecosystem.config.js`):**

```plaintext
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'my-nestjs-app',
      script: 'dist/main.js', // Path to your compiled NestJS application
      instances: 'max',
      autorestart: true,
      watch: false,
      max_memory_restart: '1G',
      env: {
        NODE_ENV: 'production',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**c. SSH Deployment and Remote Execution**
This requires setting up SSH access to your target server. The `webfactory/ssh-agent` action can facilitate this.

```plaintext
name: NestJS CI/CD with PM2

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:cov
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: SSH Agent
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.7.2
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - name: Deploy with PM2
        run: |
          ssh your-user@your-server "
            cd /path/to/your/app # Update with your app's path on the server
            git pull origin main # Or specific branch
            npm install
            npm run build
            pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js # or pm2 start ecosystem.config.js if the app isn't running yet
          "
```

**Important Considerations for PM2 Deployment:**

- **`SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`:** Store the SSH private key as a GitHub secret. Ensure the corresponding public key is authorized on your target server. This enables secure SSH access from the GitHub Actions runner. Generate a keypair dedicated to deployments to avoid compromising server access.
- **`/path/to/your/app`:** Modify this to the actual directory where your application resides on the remote server.
- **Security:** SSH deployments should be carefully secured. Consider using SSH keys with restricted permissions. Always ensure only necessary steps are done on the target server. Using a dedicated deploy user with limited permissions is best practice.

**Security Best Practices:**

- **Store sensitive information (API keys, passwords, SSH keys) as secrets in your CI/CD platform.** Never hardcode these values in your workflow files.
- **Use a dedicated deployment user with limited permissions on your target server.** This limits the potential damage if the deployment user is compromised.
- **Regularly review and update your CI/CD pipeline to ensure it remains secure.**
- **Consider using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to manage your infrastructure in a secure and automated way.**

## Setting up CI/CD with GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD provides a powerful alternative, especially when your project is hosted on GitLab. The configuration is done through a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your repository.

Here's an example demonstrating a similar workflow as the GitHub Actions example, deploying with Docker:

```plaintext
image: node:18-alpine # Docker image to use for the pipeline

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/

before_script:
  - npm install

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:cov

docker_build:
  stage: deploy
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind # Docker-in-Docker service for building images
  before_script:
    - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY
  script:
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  only:
    - main # Only run on the main branch

docker_deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine/kubectl # or any image with kubectl installed
  dependencies:
    - docker_build # ensures the docker image is built before deploy
  variables:
    KUBE_NAMESPACE: your-kubernetes-namespace #set this in the project settings CI/CD variables
  script:
    - kubectl config use-context your-kubernetes-cluster-context # or configure with kubeconfig
    - kubectl set image deployment/your-deployment-name your-container-name=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA -n $KUBE_NAMESPACE #replace all instances here
  only:
    - main
  environment:
    name: production
    url: your-application-url
```

**Explanation of GitLab CI/CD Example:**

- **`image`**: Defines the Docker image used for the pipeline. In this case, it's a Node.js 18 Alpine image.
- **`stages`**: Defines the stages of the pipeline: `build`, `test`, and `deploy`.
- **`cache`**: Caches `node_modules` to speed up subsequent builds.
- **`before_script`**: Runs before each job (installs dependencies).
- **`build`**: Builds the NestJS application. The `artifacts` section makes the `dist` directory available for subsequent jobs.
- **`test`**: Runs the tests and generates coverage reports.
- **`docker_build`**: Builds a Docker image and pushes it to the GitLab Container Registry. It uses Docker-in-Docker (Dind) service. The GitLab CI environment variables `$CI_REGISTRY_USER`, `$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, and `$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE` are automatically available and should be used.
- **`docker_deploy`**: Deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster. Requires setting up `kubectl` and configuring access to your cluster. This example sets the image of a deployment named `your-deployment-name`.

**Key Differences from GitHub Actions:**

- **`.gitlab-ci.yml`:** Configuration is based on a single file.
- **Built-in Container Registry:** GitLab offers a built-in container registry, making it easy to store and manage Docker images.
- **Environment Variables:** GitLab CI provides a set of predefined environment variables that can be used in your pipeline.
- **Kubernetes Integration:** GitLab has strong Kubernetes integration, simplifying deployments to Kubernetes clusters.

**Important GitLab CI/CD Considerations:**

- **Configure GitLab Runner:** You need to have a GitLab Runner configured to execute your CI/CD pipeline. You can use shared runners or set up your own runner.
- **Secrets Management:** Store sensitive information (like Kubernetes credentials) as masked variables in GitLab CI/CD settings. Go to _Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables_.
- **Kubernetes Access:** Configure `kubectl` with access to your Kubernetes cluster. You'll need to create a service account with appropriate permissions and configure `kubectl` using the service account's token. The easiest way is to define `KUBE_CONFIG` variable in CI/CD variables and store the whole kube config file there (you can fetch the file from your server)
- **`$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE`**, **`$CI_REGISTRY_USER`**, **`$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`** are predefined environment variables in GitLab CI, you don't need to create them.

## Conclusion

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for your NestJS application is a worthwhile investment that can significantly improve your development workflow, code quality, and release frequency. By automating the build, testing, and deployment processes, you can focus on building great software and deliver value to your users faster.
