## Installation and Setup

First, you'll need to install the necessary packages. Make sure you have Material UI core installed as a prerequisite. Open your terminal and run:

```plaintext
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/x-data-grid
```

or, using yarn:

```plaintext
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/x-data-grid
```

**Note:** You'll also need `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/styled` as peer dependencies.

## Basic Usage: Displaying Data

Let's start with a simple example to display some data in a basic Data Grid.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { DataGrid } from '@mui/x-data-grid'

const rows = [
  { id: 1, col1: 'Hello', col2: 'World' },
  { id: 2, col1: 'Data', col2: 'Grid' },
  { id: 3, col1: 'MUI', col2: 'X' },
]

const columns = [
  { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID', width: 70 },
  { field: 'col1', headerName: 'Column 1', width: 130 },
  { field: 'col2', headerName: 'Column 2', width: 130 },
]

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 300, width: '100%' }}>
      <DataGrid
        rows={rows}
        columns={columns}
        pageSize={5}
        rowsPerPageOptions={[5, 10, 25]}
        checkboxSelection
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

**Explanation:**

- **Import `DataGrid`:** We import the `DataGrid` component from `@mui/x-data-grid`.
- **Define `rows`:** This array contains the data to be displayed in the grid. Each object represents a row. The `id` field is crucial for the Data Grid to uniquely identify each row.
- **Define `columns`:** This array defines the structure of the columns. Each object specifies the `field` (which corresponds to a key in the `rows` data), `headerName` (the column title), and `width` (the column width in pixels).
- **Render `DataGrid`:** We render the `DataGrid` component, passing in the `rows` and `columns` as props. We also configure `pageSize` to set the initial number of rows displayed per page, `rowsPerPageOptions` to allow the user to choose the number of rows per page, and `checkboxSelection` to enable row selection via checkboxes. The `style` prop ensures the Data Grid takes up the full width of its container and sets a reasonable height.

## Key Features and Customization

Let's explore some of the key features and customization options offered by the MUI X Data Grid.

### 1. Sorting

Sorting allows users to arrange data in ascending or descending order based on a column. It's enabled by default.

```jsx
<DataGrid
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  sortingMode="server" // or 'client' for client-side sorting
  onSortModelChange={(newSortModel) => {
    // Handle sort model changes (e.g., fetch data from server with new sorting)
    console.log(newSortModel)
  }}
/>
```

- **`sortingMode`:** Set to `"server"` for server-side sorting (recommended for large datasets). When set to `"server"`, the `onSortModelChange` prop is essential for handling the sorting logic on your backend. If set to `"client"`, the Data Grid will handle sorting in the browser.
- **`onSortModelChange`:** This callback function is triggered whenever the sort model changes (e.g., when a user clicks a column header to sort). The `newSortModel` argument contains information about the sorted columns (e.g., field, sort direction). You'll need to implement the logic to fetch data from your server based on the new sort model.

### 2. Filtering

Filtering lets users narrow down the displayed data based on specific criteria. The MUI X Data Grid offers both quick filtering and column-specific filtering.

```jsx
import { DataGrid, GridToolbar } from '@mui/x-data-grid'

// ... (rows and columns definitions)

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 400, width: '100%' }}>
      <DataGrid
        rows={rows}
        columns={columns}
        components={{
          Toolbar: GridToolbar, // Adds the toolbar with quick filter
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **`GridToolbar`:** Import and include the `GridToolbar` component. This will add a search box above the grid that allows users to quickly filter the data. The toolbar also includes other useful features like exporting data.
- **Custom Filtering:** For more granular control, you can use the `filterModel` prop and `onFilterModelChange` prop to implement custom filtering logic, similar to the `sortingMode` and `onSortModelChange` described above.

### 3. Pagination

Pagination divides large datasets into smaller, more manageable pages.

```jsx
<DataGrid
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  pagination
  pageSize={5}
  rowsPerPageOptions={[5, 10, 25]}
  paginationMode="server" // or 'client' for client-side pagination
  rowCount={100} // Total number of rows on the server (for server-side pagination)
  onPageChange={(newPage) => {
    // Handle page changes (e.g., fetch data from server with new page)
    console.log(newPage)
  }}
/>
```

- **`pagination`:** Enables pagination.
- **`pageSize`:** Sets the initial number of rows displayed per page.
- **`rowsPerPageOptions`:** An array of options for the number of rows to display per page.
- **`paginationMode`:** Similar to `sortingMode`, set to `"server"` for server-side pagination (recommended for large datasets).
- **`rowCount`:** The total number of rows on the server. This is essential for server-side pagination to display the correct number of pages.
- **`onPageChange`:** This callback function is triggered whenever the page changes. The `newPage` argument contains the new page number. You'll need to implement the logic to fetch data from your server based on the new page number.

### 4. Editing

The Data Grid allows users to edit data directly within the grid.

```jsx
const columns = [
  { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID', width: 70 },
  { field: 'col1', headerName: 'Column 1', width: 130, editable: true },
  { field: 'col2', headerName: 'Column 2', width: 130, editable: true },
]

function App() {
  const [rowsState, setRowsState] = React.useState(rows)

  const handleCellEditCommit = React.useCallback(
    ({ id, field, value }) => {
      setRowsState((state) => {
        return state.map((row) => {
          if (row.id === id) {
            return { ...row, [field]: value }
          }
          return row
        })
      })
    },
    [setRowsState]
  )

  return (
    <div style={{ height: 300, width: '100%' }}>
      <DataGrid
        rows={rowsState}
        columns={columns}
        processRowUpdate={(newRow, oldRow) => {
          //Update your database/server with the updated row and return the newRow after successful update.
          console.log('Updating', newRow, oldRow)
          return newRow
        }}
        onProcessRowUpdateError={(error) => {
          console.error('Error updating row:', error)
        }}
        onCellEditCommit={handleCellEditCommit}
        checkboxSelection
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **`editable: true`:** Set this property on a column definition to enable editing for that column.
- **`processRowUpdate`**: The function used to update the row in the grid after the edit. You need to return the updated `newRow` from this method.
- **`onProcessRowUpdateError`:** If the server fails to update the row, this method will be called.
- **`onCellEditCommit`:** This callback is triggered after a cell has been edited. You can use it to update the state or persist the changes to your backend. In this example, `handleCellEditCommit` updates the local `rowsState`. In a real-world application, you would typically make an API call to update the data on your server.

### 5. Custom Rendering

The Data Grid allows you to customize the rendering of cells using renderers. This is useful for displaying data in a specific format or adding custom UI elements.

```jsx
import { DataGrid } from '@mui/x-data-grid'
import Button from '@mui/material/Button'

const columns = [
  { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID', width: 70 },
  { field: 'col1', headerName: 'Column 1', width: 130 },
  {
    field: 'actions',
    headerName: 'Actions',
    width: 150,
    renderCell: (params) => (
      <Button
        variant="contained"
        color="primary"
        onClick={() => alert(`Clicked row ${params.row.id}`)}
      >
        View
      </Button>
    ),
  },
]

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 300, width: '100%' }}>
      <DataGrid rows={rows} columns={columns} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **`renderCell`:** A function that renders the content of a cell. The `params` argument contains information about the cell, including the row data (`params.row`) and the column definition. In this example, we render a button that displays an alert when clicked.

### 6. Row Selection

The Data Grid supports row selection, allowing users to select one or more rows.

```jsx
<DataGrid
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  checkboxSelection
  onSelectionModelChange={(newSelection) => {
    console.log('Selected Rows', newSelection)
  }}
/>
```

- **`checkboxSelection`:** Adds checkboxes for row selection.
- **`onSelectionModelChange`:** This callback is triggered when the selection changes. The `newSelection` argument is an array of the IDs of the selected rows.

## Server-Side vs. Client-Side Processing

As mentioned earlier, the MUI X Data Grid supports both server-side and client-side processing for sorting, filtering, and pagination.

- **Client-Side Processing:** The Data Grid handles the sorting, filtering, and pagination in the browser. This is suitable for smaller datasets. It's easier to implement but can be less performant for larger datasets.

- **Server-Side Processing:** The Data Grid sends requests to the server to perform sorting, filtering, and pagination. This is recommended for larger datasets as it leverages the server's resources to handle the processing. It requires more implementation effort but provides better performance for large datasets.

## Conclusion

The MUI X Data Grid is a powerful and versatile React component that can significantly simplify the development of data-intensive applications. Its extensive features, customization options, and performance optimizations make it a valuable tool for any React developer working with tabular data. By understanding the concepts and examples presented in this guide, you'll be well-equipped to leverage the full potential of the MUI X Data Grid in your projects.
