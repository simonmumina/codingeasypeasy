# Yarn Link: Develop and Test Local Packages Like a Pro (Detailed Guide)

Developing and testing npm packages can sometimes be a tedious process. Traditionally, you'd have to publish a new version of your package to npm every time you wanted to test a change in another project. This is slow, cumbersome, and pollutes your npm registry with temporary versions.

Enter `yarn link` (and its older sibling, `npm link`), a powerful tool that allows you to **link a local package into another project as if it were installed from npm**, without actually publishing it. This is invaluable for:

- **Local Package Development:** Develop and test changes to a package in real-time, without the publish-test cycle.
- **Monorepo Management:** Simplify the development and testing of inter-dependent packages within a monorepo.
- **Testing Unreleased Changes:** Try out new features or bug fixes in your package within a real-world project _before_ publishing.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of using `yarn link`, covering everything from basic usage to advanced tips and troubleshooting.

## What is Yarn Link?

`yarn link` creates a symbolic link between your globally installed packages and the `node_modules` directory of the project you're working on. Essentially, it tricks the project into thinking the local package is installed from npm, even though it's just pointing to the files on your hard drive. This allows you to make changes to the linked package and immediately see those changes reflected in the consuming project.

## How to Use Yarn Link: A Step-by-Step Guide

Let's illustrate with a practical example. Imagine you have two projects:

- `my-library`: A local npm package you're developing.
- `my-app`: An application that uses `my-library`.

Here's how to use `yarn link` to connect them:

**1. Prepare the Package (`my-library`)**

Navigate to the root directory of your `my-library` package. This directory should contain a `package.json` file.

**2. Create the Global Link**

Run the following command in the `my-library` directory:

```plaintext
cd my-library
yarn link
```

This command does two things:

- It globally installs your package in Yarn's global `node_modules` folder.
- It creates a symbolic link that points from your global `node_modules` folder to your local `my-library` directory.

You should see output similar to this:

```
yarn link v1.22.19
success Registered "@my-org/my-library" module from "/path/to/my-library".
info You can now run `yarn link "@my-org/my-library"` in the packages you want to use this module in.
Done in 0.45s.
```

**Important:** If your package has a name that isn't scoped (e.g., just `my-library` instead of `@my-org/my-library`), you'll link without the scope: `yarn link my-library`. **Always use the name defined in your `package.json`**.

**3. Link the Package to Your Project (`my-app`)**

Now, navigate to the root directory of your `my-app` project.

**4. Connect the Link**

Run the following command, using the name of your linked package:

```plaintext
cd my-app
yarn link @my-org/my-library
```

(Remember to adjust `@my-org/my-library` to match the actual name of your package in `my-library/package.json`.)

This command creates a symbolic link within the `my-app/node_modules` directory that points to the globally linked package.

You should see output like this:

```
yarn link v1.22.19
success Using linked package for "@my-org/my-library".
Done in 0.28s.
```

**5. Verify the Link (Optional)**

You can verify that the link was created correctly by inspecting the `my-app/node_modules` directory. You should see a folder corresponding to your package (e.g., `@my-org/my-library`), and it should be a symbolic link (typically displayed with a small arrow overlay on the folder icon in your file explorer). You can also check the modification date - it should match the last modified date of files in your `my-library` directory.

**6. Start Developing!**

That's it! Now, when you make changes to the files in your `my-library` directory, those changes will be immediately reflected in your `my-app` project. You can test your changes by running your application. No need to publish new versions to npm.

## Example: `my-library` Package

Let's say `my-library` is a simple utility library that exports a function called `add`:

```plaintext
// my-library/index.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// my-library/package.json
{
  "name": "@my-org/my-library",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

## Example: `my-app` Using the Linked Package

In your `my-app`, you can now import and use the `add` function as if it were installed from npm:

```plaintext
// my-app/src/App.js
import { add } from '@my-org/my-library'

function App() {
  const sum = add(5, 3)
  return <div>The sum is: {sum}</div>
}

export default App
```

If you change the implementation of the `add` function in `my-library`, save the file, and refresh your `my-app`, you'll see the changes immediately.

## Unlinking the Package

When you're finished developing and testing, you need to unlink the package.

**1. Unlink from the Project (`my-app`)**

Run the following command in the `my-app` directory:

```plaintext
cd my-app
yarn unlink @my-org/my-library
```

This removes the symbolic link from the `my-app/node_modules` directory.

**2. Unlink the Global Link (`my-library`)**

Run the following command in the `my-library` directory:

```plaintext
cd my-library
yarn unlink
```

This removes the global link.

**3. Install the Package Properly (If Needed)**

After unlinking, if you still need to use the library, you can install it the regular way from npm (or your preferred registry):

```plaintext
cd my-app
yarn add @my-org/my-library
```

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

- **Conflicting Dependencies:** Sometimes, linking can lead to dependency conflicts, especially if the linked package has dependencies that are incompatible with your project's dependencies. Try running `yarn install` or `yarn upgrade` in your project to resolve these conflicts.
- **Package Name Mismatch:** Ensure that the package name you use with `yarn link` (e.g., `@my-org/my-library`) exactly matches the name defined in the `package.json` of your library. Case sensitivity matters!
- **Incorrect Directory:** Make sure you're running `yarn link` and `yarn unlink` commands in the correct directories (the root directory of the package and the project, respectively).
- **Stale Cache:** Sometimes, Yarn's cache can cause issues. Try clearing the cache with `yarn cache clean` and then re-linking.
- **Permissions Issues:** If you encounter permission errors, try running the commands with `sudo` (although this is generally discouraged and indicates a broader permissions issue). Consider fixing your system's permissions instead.
- **Node.js Version:** In rare cases, inconsistencies in Node.js versions can cause `yarn link` to behave unexpectedly. Verify that the Node.js version used by both the library and the application are compatible and consider using a Node.js version manager like `nvm` or `n` to manage your Node.js versions.
- **IDE Caching:** Some IDEs aggressively cache module resolution. Restarting your IDE can sometimes resolve issues where changes in the linked package aren't being picked up. Invalidate caches and restart if your IDE offers that option.
- **Monorepo Setup with Workspaces:** If you're using `yarn workspaces` in a monorepo, `yarn link` might not be necessary. Yarn workspaces already handle local package dependencies automatically.

## Advanced Tips and Considerations

- **Scoped Packages:** As mentioned earlier, pay close attention to scoped packages (e.g., `@my-org/my-library`). The scope is part of the package name and must be included in the `yarn link` command.
- **Linking Multiple Packages:** You can link multiple packages into the same project. Just repeat the `yarn link` command for each package.
- **Scripting with `yarn link`:** You can automate the linking and unlinking process by adding scripts to your `package.json` file. For example:

```plaintext
// my-app/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "link-library": "yarn link @my-org/my-library",
    "unlink-library": "yarn unlink @my-org/my-library"
  }
}
```

You can then run `yarn link-library` and `yarn unlink-library` in your terminal.

- **`npm link` vs. `yarn link`:** `npm link` is the older, original command. While it functions similarly, `yarn link` is generally preferred in Yarn-based projects for consistency and better dependency management. Avoid mixing `npm link` and `yarn link` in the same project.

## Conclusion

`yarn link` is a powerful tool that can significantly improve your development workflow when working with local packages. By understanding how it works and following the steps outlined in this guide, you can streamline your development process and efficiently test your packages in real-world scenarios. So, ditch the constant publishing cycles and embrace the efficiency of `yarn link`! Happy coding!
