# Migrating from SVN, Mercurial, or Other VCS to Git: A Comprehensive Guide

So, you've decided to move your project from SVN, Mercurial, or another legacy Version Control System (VCS) to Git. Congratulations!  Git offers powerful branching, a robust distributed architecture, and a thriving community, making it an excellent choice for modern software development. However, migrating a repository isn't always straightforward. This guide will walk you through the planning, tools, and commands you'll need for a successful migration.

## Why Migrate to Git?

Before diving into the "how," let's briefly recap the "why":

*   **Superior Branching Model:** Git's lightweight branching makes feature development and experimentation much easier than with SVN or Mercurial.
*   **Distributed Architecture:**  Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work and faster operations.
*   **Performance:** Git is generally faster than SVN and Mercurial for most operations, especially branching and merging.
*   **Community and Tooling:** Git boasts a massive community and a rich ecosystem of tools and integrations.  Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are built around Git workflows.
*   **Wider Adoption:**  Git is the de facto standard for version control in most software development environments.  This makes collaboration, hiring, and finding support much easier.

## Phase 1: Planning Your Migration

Proper planning is crucial to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition. Consider these key aspects:

1.  **Repository Size and History:**  Larger repositories with extensive histories can take longer to migrate. Assess the size of your repository and the depth of history you need to preserve.  Do you need to migrate everything, or can you start with a truncated history?
2.  **Team Communication:** Clearly communicate the migration plan to your team, including timelines, potential disruptions, and the benefits of switching to Git.
3.  **Migration Strategy:**  Choose the best approach for your team and project.  Here are two main options:
    *   **Full History Migration:** Migrates the entire history of the repository to Git. This is the ideal approach if you need to retain all historical data.
    *   **Tip Migration (Latest Revision Only):** Migrates only the latest revision to Git. This is faster and simpler but sacrifices historical information.
4.  **Repository Hosting:**  Decide where you'll host your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted). Consider factors like cost, features, and security requirements.
5.  **Branching Strategy:**  Establish a Git branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow) before the migration to ensure consistency and streamline your workflow after the transition.  Communicate this strategy to your team.
6.  **Testing:**  After migration, thoroughly test the Git repository to ensure that the code is intact, branches are correctly structured, and the history (if migrated) is accurate.
7.  **Training:** Provide training to your team on Git commands, workflows, and best practices.

## Phase 2: Choosing the Right Tools

The tool you use for migration depends on your existing VCS and your desired level of historical accuracy.  Here are some common options:

*   **`git svn` (for SVN to Git):** This is a built-in Git command that allows you to clone an SVN repository into a Git repository. It's a common and often effective approach.
*   **`git hg` (for Mercurial to Git):** Similar to `git svn`, this command allows you to clone a Mercurial repository into Git.  It requires the `hg-git` plugin.
*   **Third-party Conversion Tools:** Tools like `svn2git` offer more advanced features and customization options. They are usually available in many programming languages.
*   **Scripting:** You can write custom scripts (e.g., in Python or Bash) to automate the migration process, especially for complex scenarios.

## Phase 3: Migrating from SVN to Git Using `git svn`

`git svn` is often the simplest way to migrate from SVN to Git. Here's how:

1.  **Install Git:** If you haven't already, install Git on your system.
2.  **Create a Authors File (Optional but Recommended):**  SVN users are typically identified by usernames, while Git uses "Author Name `<email@example.com>`". Create a text file (`authors.txt`) that maps SVN usernames to Git author formats.  This improves the accuracy of commit history attribution.

    ```
    svn_username = Author Name <email@example.com>
    another_svn_user = Another Author <another@example.com>
    ```

3.  **Clone the SVN Repository:** Use the `git svn clone` command. If you have a standard SVN layout (trunk, branches, tags), use the `--stdlayout` option.  Replace `YOUR_SVN_REPO_URL` with your actual SVN repository URL and `MY_GIT_REPO` with the name of your new Git repository.

    ```bash
    git svn clone --stdlayout --authors-file=authors.txt YOUR_SVN_REPO_URL MY_GIT_REPO
    cd MY_GIT_REPO
    ```

    If your SVN repository doesn't follow the standard layout, you need to specify the trunk, branches, and tags paths explicitly:

    ```bash
    git svn clone --trunk=trunk --branches=branches --tags=tags --authors-file=authors.txt YOUR_SVN_REPO_URL MY_GIT_REPO
    cd MY_GIT_REPO
    ```

    If you only want to migrate a specific branch:

    ```bash
    git svn clone --trunk=branches/mybranch --authors-file=authors.txt YOUR_SVN_REPO_URL MY_GIT_REPO
    cd MY_GIT_REPO
    ```

    If you want to migrate a single revision, you can use the `--revision` option:

    ```bash
    git svn clone --revision 100:HEAD --authors-file=authors.txt YOUR_SVN_REPO_URL MY_GIT_REPO
    cd MY_GIT_REPO
    ```

4.  **Fetch Changes:** After the initial clone, you can fetch new changes from the SVN repository using `git svn fetch`.

    ```bash
    git svn fetch
    ```

5.  **Convert SVN Branches and Tags to Git Branches and Tags:** SVN branches and tags are imported as remote branches.  Convert them to proper Git branches and tags.  First, create local Git branches for each SVN branch:

    ```bash
    git branch -r | grep branches | cut -d '/' -f 3 | while read branch; do
      git branch $branch remotes/origin/$branch
    done
    ```

    Then, create Git tags for each SVN tag:

    ```bash
    git branch -r | grep tags | cut -d '/' -f 3 | while read tag; do
      git tag $tag remotes/origin/tags/$tag
    done
    ```

6.  **Clean Up Remote Branches:** Remove the remote branches created by `git svn`.

    ```bash
    git remote prune origin
    ```

7.  **Create a Git Repository:** Create a new Git repository on your chosen platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or locally.

8.  **Push to the New Git Repository:** Add the remote to your local repository and push the branches and tags.

    ```bash
    git remote add origin YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL
    git push --all origin
    git push --tags origin
    ```

## Phase 4: Migrating from Mercurial to Git Using `git hg`

Migrating from Mercurial to Git involves using the `git hg` command. This command might require installation of the `hg-git` plugin in Mercurial.

1.  **Install Git and Mercurial:** Ensure both Git and Mercurial are installed on your system.
2.  **Install `hg-git` plugin:** In your Mercurial installation, enable the `hg-git` plugin. This is often done by adding the following to your `~/.hgrc` file:

    ```
    [extensions]
    hggit =
    ```

3.  **Clone the Mercurial Repository:** Use `git hg clone` to clone the Mercurial repository into a Git repository.  Replace `YOUR_HG_REPO_URL` with your Mercurial repository URL and `MY_GIT_REPO` with the name of your new Git repository.

    ```bash
    git hg clone YOUR_HG_REPO_URL MY_GIT_REPO
    cd MY_GIT_REPO
    ```

4.  **Clean Up Tags (Optional):** Mercurial's tagging system can be different from Git's. You might need to clean up or convert tags after the migration. You can list all tags with:

    ```bash
    git tag
    ```

    And delete tags with:

    ```bash
    git tag -d <tag_name>
    ```

    Then, create new tags based on specific commits if needed.

5.  **Create a Git Repository:** Create a new Git repository on your chosen platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or locally.

6.  **Push to the New Git Repository:** Add the remote to your local repository and push the branches and tags.

    ```bash
    git remote add origin YOUR_GIT_REPO_URL
    git push --all origin
    git push --tags origin
    ```

## Phase 5: Handling Large Repositories

Large repositories can present challenges during migration. Here are some tips for handling them:

*   **Shallow Clone (Limited History):**  If you don't need the entire history, use a shallow clone with the `--depth` option to reduce the size of the initial clone.

    ```bash
    git svn clone --depth 100 ... # Clone only the last 100 revisions
    git hg clone --rev "last(100)" ... # Clone only the last 100 revisions in mercurial
    ```

*   **Incremental Migration:** Migrate the repository in smaller chunks over time.
*   **Filter-Branch (Use with Caution):** `git filter-branch` can be used to rewrite history (e.g., to remove large files). However, this is a complex and potentially disruptive operation.  Use it with extreme caution and only if absolutely necessary.

## Phase 6: Post-Migration Steps

After the migration, complete these essential steps:

1.  **Update Build Scripts and Deployment Processes:** Modify any scripts or processes that rely on the old VCS to use Git.
2.  **Configure CI/CD Pipelines:**  Update your Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to integrate with the new Git repository.
3.  **Retire the Old Repository:** Once you're confident that everything is working correctly, retire the old SVN or Mercurial repository to prevent accidental commits. Make it read-only to preserve it for archival purposes.
4.  **Announce the Migration:** Officially announce the completion of the migration to the team.

## Best Practices for a Smooth Migration

*   **Back Up Your Existing Repository:** Before starting the migration, create a full backup of your existing SVN or Mercurial repository.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Don't assume the migration is successful until you've thoroughly tested the new Git repository. Verify that the code, branches, tags, and history (if migrated) are accurate.
*   **Educate Your Team:**  Provide adequate training and support to your team to help them transition to Git.
*   **Document the Process:**  Document the migration process, including the steps taken, any issues encountered, and the solutions implemented. This documentation will be valuable for future reference.
*   **Plan for Downtime:** Communicate any expected downtime to stakeholders in advance.
*   **Monitor Performance:**  Monitor the performance of the new Git repository, especially after the initial push.
