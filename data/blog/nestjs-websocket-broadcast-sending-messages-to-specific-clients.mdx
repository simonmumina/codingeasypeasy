# NestJS WebSocket Broadcast: Sending Messages to Specific Clients

WebSockets provide a powerful mechanism for real-time communication between a server and its clients. NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, simplifies the implementation of WebSocket servers. This blog post delves into how to broadcast messages to specific clients using NestJS WebSockets. We'll cover the necessary setup, different strategies for identifying clients, and provide practical code examples to get you started.

## Why Target Specific Clients?

While broadcasting to all connected clients is straightforward, many real-world scenarios require sending messages to a subset of clients. Here are a few examples:

- **User-specific notifications:** Alerting a user about a new message, friend request, or system update.
- **Group chat:** Sending messages only to users participating in a specific chat room.
- **Real-time collaboration:** Updating only the collaborators of a specific document.
- **Role-based permissions:** Broadcasting administrative updates only to users with admin privileges.

## Setting Up Your NestJS WebSocket Gateway

Before we can broadcast messages, we need to establish a basic WebSocket gateway in NestJS.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install --save @nestjs/platform-socket.io @nestjs/websockets socket.io
    ```

2.  **Create a Gateway:**

    Generate a new gateway using the NestJS CLI:

    ```plaintext
    nest generate gateway events
    ```

    This creates a file `src/events/events.gateway.ts`.

3.  **Implement the Gateway:**

    Here's a basic gateway implementation that handles client connections and disconnections:

    ```plaintext
    // src/events/events.gateway.ts
    import {
      WebSocketGateway,
      SubscribeMessage,
      MessageBody,
      WebSocketServer,
      OnGatewayConnection,
      OnGatewayDisconnect,
    } from '@nestjs/websockets'
    import { Server, Socket } from 'socket.io'
    import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common'

    @WebSocketGateway({
      cors: {
        origin: '*', // Allow all origins (for development).  In production, restrict to your specific origin(s).
      },
    })
    export class EventsGateway implements OnGatewayConnection, OnGatewayDisconnect {
      @WebSocketServer()
      server: Server

      private logger: Logger = new Logger('EventsGateway')

      handleConnection(client: Socket, ...args: any[]) {
        this.logger.log(`Client connected: ${client.id}`)
      }

      handleDisconnect(client: Socket) {
        this.logger.log(`Client disconnected: ${client.id}`)
      }

      @SubscribeMessage('message')
      handleMessage(@MessageBody() message: string): void {
        this.server.emit('message', message) // Broadcast to all clients (example)
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Register the Gateway in your Module:**

    Import and add the `EventsGateway` to the `providers` array in your application module (e.g., `app.module.ts`).

    ```plaintext
    // src/app.module.ts
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
    import { EventsGateway } from './events/events.gateway'

    @Module({
      imports: [],
      controllers: [],
      providers: [EventsGateway],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

5.  **Configure CORS:** Note the `cors` configuration in the `@WebSocketGateway` decorator. This is crucial for allowing connections from your client application. In a production environment, replace `'*'` with your specific origin URL(s).

## Identifying Clients

The key to sending messages to specific clients is identifying them uniquely. Here are several common strategies:

- **Socket ID:** Each connected socket has a unique ID assigned by Socket.IO. This is the simplest but least reliable method, as the ID changes upon reconnection.
- **User ID (Authentication):** The most robust approach involves authenticating clients and associating their Socket.IO connection with their user ID. This is especially important if you're handling sensitive data.
- **Custom Identifiers:** You can use any unique identifier that makes sense for your application, such as a session ID, group ID, or document ID.

### 1. Using Socket ID

Each connected client has a unique `socket.id` assigned by Socket.IO. You can retrieve this ID when a client connects and store it if needed. However, as mentioned before, `socket.id` changes upon reconnection, so this is generally not a suitable long-term identifier.

```plaintext
// src/events/events.gateway.ts
import {
  WebSocketGateway,
  OnGatewayConnection,
  OnGatewayDisconnect,
  WebSocketServer,
} from '@nestjs/websockets'
import { Server, Socket } from 'socket.io'
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common'

@WebSocketGateway({
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
  },
})
export class EventsGateway implements OnGatewayConnection, OnGatewayDisconnect {
  @WebSocketServer()
  server: Server

  private logger: Logger = new Logger('EventsGateway')
  private connectedClients: Map<string, Socket> = new Map()

  handleConnection(client: Socket) {
    this.logger.log(`Client connected: ${client.id}`)
    this.connectedClients.set(client.id, client) // Store the socket
  }

  handleDisconnect(client: Socket) {
    this.logger.log(`Client disconnected: ${client.id}`)
    this.connectedClients.delete(client.id) // Remove the socket
  }

  sendMessageToClient(socketId: string, message: string) {
    const client = this.connectedClients.get(socketId)
    if (client) {
      client.emit('privateMessage', message) // Emit to a specific client
    } else {
      this.logger.log(`Client with ID ${socketId} not found.`)
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** The client would then need to know its `socket.id` (easily obtainable through `socket.id` on the client side after the connection is established) and send that to the server if it needs the server to later target it by ID. This is often impractical.

### 2. Using User ID (Authentication) - RECOMMENDED

A more reliable approach is to authenticate the user and associate their socket with their user ID. Here's a simplified example assuming you have an authentication mechanism in place:

```plaintext
// src/events/events.gateway.ts
import {
  WebSocketGateway,
  OnGatewayConnection,
  OnGatewayDisconnect,
  WebSocketServer,
} from '@nestjs/websockets'
import { Server, Socket } from 'socket.io'
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common'
import { AuthService } from '../auth/auth.service' // Assuming you have an AuthService

@WebSocketGateway({
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
  },
})
export class EventsGateway implements OnGatewayConnection, OnGatewayDisconnect {
  @WebSocketServer()
  server: Server

  private logger: Logger = new Logger('EventsGateway')
  private connectedUsers: Map<string, Socket> = new Map() // Maps userId to Socket

  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {}

  async handleConnection(client: Socket) {
    try {
      const token = client.handshake.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1] // Extract token from header
      if (!token) {
        this.logger.error('No token provided')
        client.disconnect(true)
        return
      }

      const userId = await this.authService.validateToken(token) // Validate the token and extract the user ID

      if (!userId) {
        this.logger.error('Invalid token')
        client.disconnect(true)
        return
      }

      this.logger.log(`Client connected: ${client.id}, User ID: ${userId}`)
      this.connectedUsers.set(userId, client) // Associate userId with socket
      client.data.userId = userId // Store the user ID on the socket
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error(`Authentication error: ${error.message}`)
      client.disconnect(true)
    }
  }

  handleDisconnect(client: Socket) {
    const userId = client.data.userId // Get the user ID from the socket
    if (userId) {
      this.logger.log(`Client disconnected: ${client.id}, User ID: ${userId}`)
      this.connectedUsers.delete(userId)
    } else {
      this.logger.log(`Client disconnected: ${client.id}`)
    }
  }

  sendMessageToUser(userId: string, message: string) {
    const client = this.connectedUsers.get(userId)
    if (client) {
      client.emit('privateMessage', message)
    } else {
      this.logger.log(`User with ID ${userId} not found.`)
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Improvements and Explanation:**

- **Authentication:** The code now attempts to authenticate the user on connection using an `AuthService`. This service (not implemented here, but you'd need to create one) is responsible for validating the authentication token (usually a JWT) and extracting the user ID.
- **Token Extraction:** The code extracts the authentication token from the `Authorization` header in the WebSocket handshake. This assumes the client sends the token in the standard `Bearer <token>` format.
- **Error Handling:** Includes more robust error handling for invalid or missing tokens.
- **`connectedUsers` Map:** The `connectedUsers` map stores the association between the user ID and the Socket object.
- **`client.data`:** We store the `userId` on the `client.data` object. This makes it easy to retrieve the user ID when the client disconnects. (This approach leverages `socket.io`'s ability to store arbitrary data on the socket itself.)
- **`sendMessageToUser` Function:** This function sends a message to a specific user based on their ID.
- **Client-Side Authentication:** The client would need to send the authentication token in the `Authorization` header when establishing the WebSocket connection. For example (using JavaScript):

  ```plaintext
  // Client-side JavaScript
  const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken') // Get the token from storage

  const socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
    // Replace with your server URL
    extraHeaders: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  })

  socket.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('Connected to the server!')
  })

  socket.on('privateMessage', (message) => {
    console.log('Received private message:', message)
  })
  ```

  Remember to replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with your actual server URL and adjust the way you retrieve the authentication token based on your authentication flow.

**Important Considerations for Authentication:**

- **Secure Token Storage:** Never store authentication tokens in local storage if you are storing sensitive data. Use `httpOnly` cookies for improved security.
- **Token Refresh:** Implement a token refresh mechanism to handle token expiration.
- **Authentication Service:** Create a dedicated `AuthService` to handle token validation and user ID retrieval.
- **Proper Error Handling:** Handle authentication errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the client.

### 3. Using Custom Identifiers (e.g., Group IDs)

You can also use custom identifiers to group clients and send messages to those groups. This is useful for features like chat rooms or collaborative documents.

```plaintext
// src/events/events.gateway.ts
import {
  WebSocketGateway,
  OnGatewayConnection,
  OnGatewayDisconnect,
  WebSocketServer,
} from '@nestjs/websockets'
import { Server, Socket } from 'socket.io'
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common'

@WebSocketGateway({
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
  },
})
export class EventsGateway implements OnGatewayConnection, OnGatewayDisconnect {
  @WebSocketServer()
  server: Server

  private logger: Logger = new Logger('EventsGateway')
  private groupMemberships: Map<string, Set<Socket>> = new Map() // Maps groupId to a Set of Sockets

  handleConnection(client: Socket) {
    this.logger.log(`Client connected: ${client.id}`)
  }

  handleDisconnect(client: Socket) {
    // Remove the client from all groups they belong to
    this.groupMemberships.forEach((members, groupId) => {
      if (members.has(client)) {
        members.delete(client)
        if (members.size === 0) {
          this.groupMemberships.delete(groupId) // Remove group if empty
        }
      }
    })
    this.logger.log(`Client disconnected: ${client.id}`)
  }

  joinGroup(client: Socket, groupId: string) {
    if (!this.groupMemberships.has(groupId)) {
      this.groupMemberships.set(groupId, new Set())
    }
    this.groupMemberships.get(groupId).add(client)
    this.logger.log(`Client ${client.id} joined group ${groupId}`)
  }

  leaveGroup(client: Socket, groupId: string) {
    if (this.groupMemberships.has(groupId)) {
      const members = this.groupMemberships.get(groupId)
      members.delete(client)
      if (members.size === 0) {
        this.groupMemberships.delete(groupId)
      }
      this.logger.log(`Client ${client.id} left group ${groupId}`)
    }
  }

  sendMessageToGroup(groupId: string, message: string) {
    const members = this.groupMemberships.get(groupId)
    if (members) {
      members.forEach((client) => {
        client.emit('groupMessage', message)
      })
    } else {
      this.logger.log(`Group with ID ${groupId} not found.`)
    }
  }
}
```

**How it works:**

1.  **`groupMemberships` Map:** This map stores the association between group IDs and the sockets that belong to those groups. We use a `Set` to ensure that each socket is only added to a group once.
2.  **`joinGroup` Function:** This function allows a client to join a specific group. It adds the client's socket to the set of members for that group.
3.  **`leaveGroup` Function:** This function allows a client to leave a group. It removes the client's socket from the set of members for that group.
4.  **`handleDisconnect` Function:** Crucially, the `handleDisconnect` function now iterates through all groups and removes the disconnected client from any group it was a member of. This prevents messages from being sent to disconnected clients. It also cleans up empty groups.
5.  **`sendMessageToGroup` Function:** This function sends a message to all members of a specific group. It iterates through the set of members and emits the message to each socket.
6.  **Client-Side Implementation:** The client needs to be able to send join/leave group messages. For example:

```plaintext
// Client-side JavaScript

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000') // Replace with your server URL

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to the server!')
  // Join a group
  socket.emit('joinGroup', 'group123')
})

socket.on('groupMessage', (message) => {
  console.log('Received group message:', message)
})

// Later, to leave the group:
// socket.emit('leaveGroup', 'group123');
```

Remember to replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with your actual server URL.

## Sending Messages

Once you have identified and stored your clients using one of the methods described above, you can send messages to them using the `emit` method of the `Socket` object:

```plaintext
// Inside the EventsGateway class (using the User ID example)

sendMessageToUser(userId: string, message: string) {
  const client = this.connectedUsers.get(userId);
  if (client) {
    client.emit('privateMessage', message); // Send the message to the client
  } else {
    this.logger.log(`User with ID ${userId} not found.`);
  }
}
```

Replace `'privateMessage'` with the event name you want to use. The client will listen for this event and handle the received message.

## Best Practices

- **Authentication:** Always authenticate clients to protect your application and ensure that messages are only sent to authorized users.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch and handle potential errors, such as invalid tokens or non-existent clients.
- **Scalability:** For high-traffic applications, consider using a message queue or a distributed caching system to handle WebSocket connections and message routing efficiently.
- **Security:** Sanitize user input and validate data to prevent security vulnerabilities. Be mindful of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Connection Management:** Properly handle client connections and disconnections to avoid memory leaks and ensure that messages are only sent to active clients. The example code provided addresses this.
- **Logging:** Use logging to track client connections, disconnections, and message flow. This will help you troubleshoot issues and monitor your application's performance.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect your server from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.
