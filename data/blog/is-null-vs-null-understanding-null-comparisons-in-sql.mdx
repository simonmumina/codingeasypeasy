# IS NULL vs. = NULL: Understanding NULL Comparisons in SQL

When working with databases, especially in SQL, you'll inevitably encounter `NULL` values. `NULL` represents a missing or unknown value, and understanding how to handle `NULL` is critical for writing accurate and efficient SQL queries. A common point of confusion arises when comparing values to `NULL` using the `=` operator. This blog post clarifies the fundamental difference between `IS NULL` and `= NULL`, explaining why `=` doesn't work as expected for `NULL` comparisons and demonstrating the correct way to check for `NULL` values.

## What is NULL?

Before diving into the comparison operators, let's briefly recap what `NULL` represents.

- `NULL` is **not** the same as zero (0).
- `NULL` is **not** the same as an empty string ('').
- `NULL` represents the absence of a value or an unknown value. Think of it as "no information available."

## The Problem with `= NULL`

Many developers, especially those new to SQL, instinctively try to use the `=` operator to check if a column contains a `NULL` value. For example:

```plaintext
-- This WILL NOT work as expected!
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = NULL;
```

This query **will not** return any rows, even if there are employees with a `NULL` value in the `department` column. Why?

The `=` operator is designed for comparing known values. `NULL` represents an _unknown_ value. Comparing an unknown value to another unknown value (which `NULL` essentially represents on both sides of the `=` operator) results in an _unknown_ outcome. SQL interprets this as `FALSE`, causing the `WHERE` clause to filter out any rows with `NULL` in the `department` column.

In simpler terms, using `=` with `NULL` doesn't perform a direct comparison in the same way it does with other data types. It doesn't tell you whether the value is `NULL` or not; it only tells you that the comparison itself is undefined (which equates to `FALSE` in the `WHERE` clause).

## The Correct Way: `IS NULL`

The correct way to check for `NULL` values in SQL is to use the `IS NULL` operator. This operator is specifically designed to test whether a value is `NULL`.

```plaintext
-- This is the correct way to check for NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NULL;
```

This query **will** return all rows where the `department` column contains a `NULL` value.

## Examples: Demonstrating `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`

Let's illustrate with a practical example. Assume we have an `employees` table with the following structure and data:

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    department VARCHAR(255),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice Smith', 'Sales', 60000.00),
(2, 'Bob Johnson', 'Marketing', 75000.00),
(3, 'Charlie Brown', NULL, 50000.00),
(4, 'David Miller', 'Sales', NULL),
(5, 'Eve Davis', 'Engineering', 90000.00);
```

**Example 1: Finding Employees with No Department**

To find all employees who do _not_ have a department assigned (i.e., `department` is `NULL`), we use `IS NULL`:

```plaintext
SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees WHERE department IS NULL;
```

This query will return:

| id  | name          | salary   |
| --- | ------------- | -------- |
| 3   | Charlie Brown | 50000.00 |

**Example 2: Finding Employees with a Department**

To find all employees who _do_ have a department assigned (i.e., `department` is _not_ `NULL`), we use `IS NOT NULL`:

```plaintext
SELECT id, name, department, salary FROM employees WHERE department IS NOT NULL;
```

This query will return:

| id  | name        | department  | salary   |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1   | Alice Smith | Sales       | 60000.00 |
| 2   | Bob Johnson | Marketing   | 75000.00 |
| 5   | Eve Davis   | Engineering | 90000.00 |

**Example 3: Finding Employees with No Salary**

Similarly, to find employees with no salary information, we can use `IS NULL` on the `salary` column:

```plaintext
SELECT id, name, department FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

This query will return:

| id  | name         | department |
| --- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 4   | David Miller | Sales      |

## Using `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` in Complex Queries

`IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` can be incorporated into more complex queries with other conditions:

**Example: Finding Employees in Sales Department with No Salary**

```plaintext
SELECT id, name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary IS NULL;
```

This query will find employees who are in the Sales department and have a `NULL` value for their salary.

**Example: Finding Employees NOT in Sales AND whose departments are unknown**

```plaintext
SELECT id, name FROM employees WHERE department != 'Sales' OR department IS NULL;
```

This query combines a negative comparison (`!=`) with `IS NULL`. Note that `!= NULL` won't work (just like `= NULL` wouldn't).

## The COALESCE Function: Handling NULL Values

While `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` are essential for filtering, the `COALESCE` function provides a way to replace `NULL` values with a specified default value.

The `COALESCE` function takes a list of arguments and returns the first non-`NULL` argument.

```plaintext
SELECT id, name, COALESCE(department, 'Unknown Department') AS department FROM employees;
```

In this example, if the `department` column is `NULL`, `COALESCE` will return 'Unknown Department' instead. This is useful for displaying more informative results in reports or applications.

## Key Takeaways

- `NULL` represents an unknown or missing value.
- **Never** use `=` to compare a value to `NULL`. It will not work as expected.
- Use `IS NULL` to check if a value is `NULL`.
- Use `IS NOT NULL` to check if a value is not `NULL`.
- The `COALESCE` function can be used to replace `NULL` values with a default value.

Understanding how to handle `NULL` values correctly is crucial for writing accurate and robust SQL queries. By using `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` appropriately, you can ensure that your queries return the intended results and avoid unexpected behavior. Always remember that `NULL` is not a value that can be directly compared to using `=`, and leveraging the correct operators will significantly improve your SQL skills.
