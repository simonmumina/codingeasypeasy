# Migrating from BootstrapVue 2 to BootstrapVue 3 (Vue 3): A Comprehensive Guide

BootstrapVue 3 is a fantastic component library that brings the power and flexibility of Bootstrap to Vue 3. If you're currently using BootstrapVue 2 in your Vue 2 project, upgrading to BootstrapVue 3 for your Vue 3 project unlocks performance improvements, new features, and alignment with the latest Vue ecosystem. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of the migration process.

## Why Migrate?

Before we dive in, let's quickly recap why migrating to BootstrapVue 3 is beneficial:

- **Vue 3 Compatibility:** BootstrapVue 3 is built specifically for Vue 3, leveraging its new features like the Composition API, Teleport, and Fragments, leading to better performance and a more streamlined development experience.
- **Performance Enhancements:** Vue 3 itself offers significant performance improvements over Vue 2. BootstrapVue 3 benefits directly from these improvements.
- **New Features:** BootstrapVue 3 introduces new components and enhancements to existing ones, providing more flexibility and control over your UI.
- **Long-Term Support:** BootstrapVue 2 is no longer actively maintained. Migrating to BootstrapVue 3 ensures you receive ongoing bug fixes, security patches, and new feature additions.
- **Modern Development Practices:** Vue 3 encourages the use of Composition API which offers greater reusability of logic between components.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have the following:

- **Vue 3 Project:** You must have an existing Vue 3 project or be planning to create one. If you are on Vue 2 you need to first migrate to Vue 3. Use the Vue Migration Helper tool for your Vue 2 to Vue 3 migration. This is out of scope for this article, but a crucial step.
- **Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm:** Ensure you have Node.js and your preferred package manager installed.
- **Backup:** **Crucially, create a backup of your existing project.** This will allow you to easily revert if something goes wrong during the migration.
- **Familiarity with Vue 3:** A basic understanding of Vue 3 syntax and the Composition API is helpful.

## Step-by-Step Migration Guide

Let's break down the migration process into manageable steps:

**1. Uninstall BootstrapVue 2**

First, remove BootstrapVue 2 and its associated dependencies from your project:

```bash
npm uninstall bootstrap-vue bootstrap vue
# or
yarn remove bootstrap-vue bootstrap vue
# or
pnpm remove bootstrap-vue bootstrap vue
```

**2. Install BootstrapVue 3 and Bootstrap**

Now, install BootstrapVue 3 along with the necessary Bootstrap CSS:

```bash
npm install bootstrap-vue-next bootstrap
# or
yarn add bootstrap-vue-next bootstrap
# or
pnpm add bootstrap-vue-next bootstrap
```

Note that the package name has changed to `bootstrap-vue-next`. Also, ensure you have Bootstrap's CSS installed as well. This guide assumes you're using Bootstrap's CSS and not a custom version.

**3. Configure Bootstrap CSS**

There are several ways to include Bootstrap CSS:

- **Import in your main.js/main.ts:**

  ```javascript
  // main.js or main.ts
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import App from './App.vue'
  import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
  import 'bootstrap-vue-next/dist/bootstrap-vue-next.css'

  const app = createApp(App)
  app.mount('#app')
  ```

- **Import in your `App.vue`:** This is generally not recommended as it can impact initial load time.

  ```plaintext
  <template>
    <router-view />
  </template>

  <script setup>
  import { onMounted } from 'vue';

  onMounted(() => {
    import('bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css')
    import('bootstrap-vue-next/dist/bootstrap-vue-next.css')
  })
  </script>
  ```

- **Link in your `index.html`:** This is the most straightforward but can lead to loading order issues.

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <title>My Vue App</title>
      <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      />
      <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-vue-next/dist/bootstrap-vue-next.css"
      />
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="app"></div>
      <script type="module" src="/src/main.js"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

Choose the method that best suits your project setup and performance requirements. Importing in `main.js` is generally the preferred approach.

**4. Register BootstrapVue 3 Components (If needed)**

In BootstrapVue 2, you had to explicitly register individual components. BootstrapVue 3 takes a different approach and uses automatic component registration. This means that all components are available for use in your templates without needing to import or register them individually.

However, if you _prefer_ explicit registration, you can do so for specific components to optimize bundle size.

```javascript
// main.js or main.ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import { BButton } from 'bootstrap-vue-next' // Example Component

const app = createApp(App)

app.component('BButton', BButton) // Globally register the component

app.mount('#app')
```

Or for plugin:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import BootstrapVueNext from 'bootstrap-vue-next'

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
import 'bootstrap-vue-next/dist/bootstrap-vue-next.css'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(BootstrapVueNext)

app.mount('#app')
```

**5. Update Component Syntax**

This is the most time-consuming part of the migration. You'll need to review your code and update the syntax of BootstrapVue components to match the BootstrapVue 3 API. Here are some common changes:

- **Prop Names:** Many prop names have been updated for consistency and clarity. Refer to the BootstrapVue 3 documentation for the correct prop names. Pay close attention to case changes, as Vue 3 uses a different convention for prop naming than Vue 2. `kebab-case` might be preferred.
- **Event Names:** Similarly, event names may have changed.
- **Slot Syntax:** Vue 3's slot syntax is more explicit. Use the `#` shorthand for named slots. For example:

  ```plaintext
  <!-- BootstrapVue 2 -->
  <b-modal>
    <template slot="header">Modal Header</template>
    <template slot="default">Modal Body</template>
    <template slot="footer">Modal Footer</template>
  </b-modal>

  <!-- BootstrapVue 3 -->
  <BModal>
    <template #header>Modal Header</template>
    <template #default>Modal Body</template>
    <template #footer>Modal Footer</template>
  </BModal>
  ```

- **Scoped Slots:** Vue 3 handles scoped slots differently. If you're using scoped slots, update your code accordingly. Scoped slots are the ones which pass props back to the template. They are often used to customize the rendering of individual items in a list, for example.

  ```plaintext
  <!-- BootstrapVue 2 -->
  <b-table>
    <template slot="cell(name)" slot-scope="data">
      {{ data.value.toUpperCase() }}
    </template>
  </b-table>

  <!-- BootstrapVue 3 -->
  <BTable>
    <template #cell(name)="{ value }">
      {{ value.toUpperCase() }}
    </template>
  </BTable>
  ```

- **Component Changes:** Some components may have been renamed, removed, or replaced with alternative solutions. Consult the BootstrapVue 3 documentation to identify and address these changes.

**Example: Updating `BButton`**

Let's say you're using the `BButton` component. Here's a potential change you might encounter:

```plaintext
<!-- BootstrapVue 2 -->
<b-button variant="primary">Click Me</b-button>

<!-- BootstrapVue 3 -->
<BButton variant="primary">Click Me</BButton>
```

In this simple example, the change is minimal. However, more complex components with numerous props may require more significant adjustments.

**6. Address Breaking Changes**

BootstrapVue 3 introduces several breaking changes compared to BootstrapVue 2. Here are some notable areas to watch out for:

- **Removed Components:** Some components may have been removed in BootstrapVue 3 due to redundancy or better alternatives available in Vue 3.
- **Prop and Event Name Changes:** As mentioned earlier, many prop and event names have been updated. Carefully review the documentation for each component you use.
- **CSS Class Updates:** Bootstrap itself undergoes updates, which can affect CSS class names. Ensure your styling is compatible with the version of Bootstrap you're using.
- **Global Configuration:** The way you configure global options (e.g., custom icons) may have changed.

**7. Testing and Debugging**

After updating your code, thoroughly test your application to identify any issues. Pay attention to:

- **Component Rendering:** Ensure all components are rendering correctly and displaying the expected data.
- **Functionality:** Verify that all interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.) are working as expected.
- **Styling:** Check for any styling inconsistencies or broken layouts.
- **Console Errors:** Examine the browser's console for any error messages, which can provide valuable clues about potential problems.

Use your browser's developer tools to inspect elements and debug your code. Vue Devtools can also be invaluable for understanding component hierarchies and data flow.

**8. Update Dependencies**

Make sure all your other dependencies are compatible with Vue 3. Upgrade any outdated packages to their latest versions. Be mindful of potential breaking changes in other libraries as well.

**9. Code Style and Best Practices**

As you migrate, consider adopting Vue 3's recommended code style and best practices:

- **Composition API:** Embrace the Composition API for better code organization and reusability.
- **`script setup`:** Use `<script setup>` for a more concise and readable component syntax.
- **Type Checking (TypeScript):** If you're not already using TypeScript, consider adopting it for improved code maintainability and reduced errors.

**10. Documentation is Your Friend!**

The official BootstrapVue 3 documentation is your most valuable resource throughout this migration process. Refer to it frequently to understand the correct syntax, prop names, event names, and any breaking changes.

## Code Example: Migrating a Simple Modal

Let's illustrate the migration process with a simple modal component:

```plaintext
<!-- BootstrapVue 2 -->
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button @click="showModal">Show Modal</b-button>

    <b-modal id="my-modal" title="My Modal" @hidden="resetModal">
      <p>This is the modal content.</p>
    </b-modal>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      show: false
    }
  },
  methods: {
    showModal() {
      this.$bvModal.show('my-modal')
    },
    resetModal() {
      this.show = false
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

```plaintext
<!-- BootstrapVue 3 -->
<template>
  <div>
    <BButton @click="show = true">Show Modal</BButton>

    <BModal v-model:show="show" title="My Modal" @hidden="resetModal">
      <p>This is the modal content.</p>
    </BModal>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const show = ref(false);

const resetModal = () => {
  show.value = false
}
</script>
```

Key changes in this example:

- The Modal is now controlled with `v-model:show` which simplifies showing and hiding the modal.
- The Composition API is now used with `<script setup>`.
