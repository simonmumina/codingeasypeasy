# Effortless Rich Text Editing in React with @mantine/tiptap: A Comprehensive Guide

Rich text editors are essential components for countless web applications, from blogging platforms and content management systems (CMS) to note-taking apps and online documentation. Choosing the right rich text editor library for your React project can significantly impact the development process and the overall user experience. **@mantine/tiptap** emerges as a strong contender, combining the power and flexibility of Tiptap with the user-friendly design principles of the Mantine UI library.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about using `@mantine/tiptap`, from initial setup to advanced customization. We'll cover common use cases, demonstrate code examples, and provide practical tips for creating a truly exceptional rich text editing experience in your React applications.

## What is @mantine/tiptap?

`@mantine/tiptap` is a React component library that provides a rich text editor built on top of [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/). Tiptap itself is a headless, extensible, and collaborative rich text editor based on [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/). By leveraging Tiptap's robust architecture and combining it with the well-designed and highly customizable Mantine UI library, `@mantine/tiptap` offers a seamless integration experience and a visually appealing editor.

**Key Benefits of Using @mantine/tiptap:**

- **Based on Tiptap:** Inherits Tiptap's powerful and extensible architecture, allowing for fine-grained control over editor functionality.
- **Mantine UI Integration:** Provides a clean, modern, and customizable UI that seamlessly integrates with other Mantine components.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple and intuitive API for quick setup and integration into your React projects.
- **Highly Customizable:** Extensive options for customizing the editor's appearance, behavior, and functionality.
- **Built-in Extensions:** Comes with a variety of built-in extensions for common rich text editing features (e.g., bold, italic, lists, headings, links, images).
- **Collaborative Editing Support:** Tiptap's underlying architecture supports collaborative editing features (though implementation requires additional effort).
- **React Hooks for State Management:** Provides React hooks for managing the editor's state and interacting with its API.

## Getting Started: Installation and Setup

Let's begin by setting up `@mantine/tiptap` in your React project.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version 16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A React project (created with Create React App, Next.js, or similar)
- Mantine UI Core and Hooks packages already installed (`@mantine/core`, `@mantine/hooks`).

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Install the `@mantine/tiptap` package:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install @mantine/tiptap @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit
    # OR
    yarn add @mantine/tiptap @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit
    ```

    - `@mantine/tiptap`: The main Mantine Tiptap component library.
    - `@tiptap/react`: React bindings for Tiptap.
    - `@tiptap/starter-kit`: A collection of essential Tiptap extensions (e.g., Paragraph, Heading, Bold, Italic, BulletList, OrderedList). You can choose to install specific extensions instead of the starter kit if you prefer a more minimalist approach.

2.  **Import the `Editor` component and use the `useEditor` hook:**

    ```jsx
    import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'
    import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
    import { Editor } from '@mantine/tiptap'
    import { useMantineTheme } from '@mantine/core'

    function MyEditor() {
      const theme = useMantineTheme()
      const editor = useEditor({
        extensions: [StarterKit],
        content: '<p>Hello World!</p>',
      })

      if (!editor) {
        return null
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <Editor editor={editor} />
          <EditorContent editor={editor} />
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default MyEditor
    ```

    - `useEditor`: A React hook that initializes and manages the Tiptap editor instance. You pass extensions and initial content to this hook.
    - `EditorContent`: The actual editable area where the text is displayed.
    - `Editor`: Mantine's wrapper component which renders the toolbar.
    - `StarterKit`: A group of basic extensions.
    - `useMantineTheme`: Hook to access Mantine's theme.

3.  **Render the editor component:**

    Now, render the `MyEditor` component in your application.

    ```jsx
    import MyEditor from './MyEditor'

    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>My Rich Text Editor</h1>
          <MyEditor />
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default App
    ```

You should now see a basic rich text editor in your application. You can type text, format it using the default extensions, and see the changes reflected in the editor area.

## Customizing the Editor

One of the great strengths of `@mantine/tiptap` (and Tiptap in general) is its customizability. You can tailor the editor's appearance, behavior, and functionality to precisely meet the needs of your application.

**1. Adding More Extensions:**

Tiptap's power lies in its extension system. Extensions are essentially plugins that add specific features to the editor. Beyond the `StarterKit`, there are numerous other built-in and community-developed extensions available.

Here's an example of adding the `Image` extension:

```plaintext
npm install @tiptap/extension-image
# OR
yarn add @tiptap/extension-image
```

```jsx
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import Image from '@tiptap/extension-image'
import { Editor } from '@mantine/tiptap'
import { useMantineTheme } from '@mantine/core'

function MyEditor() {
  const theme = useMantineTheme()

  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Image.configure({
        inline: true, // Allows images to be inline with text
      }),
    ],
    content: '<p>Hello World!</p>',
  })

  if (!editor) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Editor editor={editor} />
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyEditor
```

Now you can insert images into your editor using the toolbar. You can configure the image extension further to control how images are handled (e.g., maximum size, allowed formats, custom upload logic).

**2. Customizing the Toolbar:**

The `@mantine/tiptap` `Editor` component renders the toolbar. You can customize which extensions are available in the toolbar via props on that component.

```jsx
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import Image from '@tiptap/extension-image'
import { Editor } from '@mantine/tiptap'
import { useMantineTheme } from '@mantine/core'

function MyEditor() {
  const theme = useMantineTheme()

  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Image.configure({
        inline: true, // Allows images to be inline with text
      }),
    ],
    content: '<p>Hello World!</p>',
  })

  if (!editor) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Editor
        editor={editor}
        extensions={[
          'bold',
          'italic',
          'underline',
          'strike',
          'h1',
          'h2',
          'h3',
          'bulletList',
          'orderedList',
          'image',
          'link',
        ]}
      />
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyEditor
```

This code only displays the specified extensions in the toolbar. You can also rearrange the order of the buttons by changing the order in the `extensions` prop.

**3. Custom Styles and Themes:**

Mantine's theme system allows you to easily customize the appearance of the editor. You can use the `useMantineTheme` hook to access the current theme and apply custom styles.

```jsx
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import { Editor } from '@mantine/tiptap'
import { useMantineTheme, createStyles } from '@mantine/core'

const useStyles = createStyles((theme) => ({
  editor: {
    border: `1px solid ${theme.colors.gray[3]}`,
    borderRadius: theme.radius.md,
    padding: theme.spacing.md,
    minHeight: '200px',
  },
}))

function MyEditor() {
  const theme = useMantineTheme()
  const { classes } = useStyles()

  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: '<p>Hello World!</p>',
  })

  if (!editor) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Editor editor={editor} />
      <div className={classes.editor}>
        <EditorContent editor={editor} />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyEditor
```

In this example, we're using `createStyles` from Mantine to define a custom style for the editor's container. We're adding a border, rounded corners, padding, and a minimum height to the editor area. You can adjust these styles to match your application's design. You can also customize the styles of individual elements within the editor using CSS or CSS-in-JS techniques.

**4. Creating Custom Extensions:**

For advanced customization, you can create your own Tiptap extensions to add completely new functionality to the editor. This involves defining a new Tiptap node or mark schema, writing the necessary JavaScript logic, and potentially creating a custom React component to interact with the extension. Creating custom extensions is beyond the scope of this introductory guide, but the Tiptap documentation provides detailed information on how to do so.

## Common Use Cases and Examples

Here are a few common use cases for `@mantine/tiptap` and example implementations:

**1. Basic Blog Post Editor:**

This example demonstrates a simple blog post editor with basic formatting options (bold, italic, headings, lists, links).

```jsx
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import Link from '@tiptap/extension-link'
import { Editor } from '@mantine/tiptap'
import { useState } from 'react'

function BlogPostEditor() {
  const [content, setContent] = useState('<p>Start writing your blog post here...</p>')

  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Link.configure({
        openOnClick: false, // Prevents the link from opening on click in the editor
      }),
    ],
    content: content,
    onUpdate: ({ editor }) => {
      setContent(editor.getHTML())
    },
  })

  if (!editor) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Editor editor={editor} />
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
      <p>HTML Preview:</p>
      <pre>{content}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}

export default BlogPostEditor
```

**2. Note-Taking Application:**

This example showcases an editor suitable for a note-taking application, including features like checklists and code blocks.

```jsx
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from '@tiptap/react'
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import TaskList from '@tiptap/extension-task-list'
import TaskItem from '@tiptap/extension-task-item'
import CodeBlockLowlight from '@tiptap/extension-code-block-lowlight'
import { lowlight } from 'lowlight' // For syntax highlighting
import { Editor } from '@mantine/tiptap'

function NoteEditor() {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      TaskList,
      TaskItem,
      CodeBlockLowlight.configure({
        lowlight,
      }),
    ],
    content: '<p>Start taking notes here...</p>',
  })

  if (!editor) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Editor editor={editor} />
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default NoteEditor
```

**3. Collaborative Editing:**

While a complete collaborative editing solution requires server-side integration and real-time communication mechanisms (e.g., WebSockets), `@mantine/tiptap` and Tiptap provide the foundation for building such features. The key is to use the `Collaboration` and `CollaborationCursor` extensions from Tiptap, along with a suitable collaboration provider (e.g., Yjs).

**Important Considerations for Collaborative Editing:**

- **Conflict Resolution:** Implement robust conflict resolution strategies to handle simultaneous edits from multiple users.
- **Real-time Communication:** Use a real-time communication library (e.g., Socket.IO, Pusher) to synchronize changes between clients.
- **Server-Side Storage:** Store the shared document on the server and manage updates.

## Advanced Features and Tips

Here are a few advanced features and tips to help you get the most out of `@mantine/tiptap`:

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Define custom keyboard shortcuts for common actions using Tiptap's `editor.commands` object.
- **Custom Menu Items:** Create custom menu items to extend the editor's functionality.
- **Event Handling:** Listen for events such as `focus`, `blur`, `keydown`, and `keyup` to perform custom actions.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that your editor is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility guidelines (e.g., providing appropriate ARIA attributes).
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure the stability and reliability of your editor.
