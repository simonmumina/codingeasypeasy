# Install and Setup Chakra UI in a Vite Project: A Comprehensive Guide

Chakra UI is a popular component library for React that provides a set of accessible, reusable, and composable UI components, making it easy to build modern and responsive web applications. Vite, on the other hand, is a lightning-fast build tool and development server. Combining these two technologies allows you to create efficient and maintainable React projects with beautiful and accessible user interfaces.

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough of installing and setting up Chakra UI in a Vite project, complete with code examples and best practices.  Whether you're starting a new project or adding Chakra UI to an existing one, this tutorial will equip you with the knowledge you need.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** (Version 16 or later is recommended) You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm or Yarn or pnpm:** Choose your preferred package manager.
*   **A code editor:**  Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any editor you are comfortable with.

## Step 1: Create a New Vite Project

If you don't already have a Vite project, let's create one. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `my-chakra-vite-app` with your desired project name:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-chakra-vite-app --template react-ts
# OR
yarn create vite my-chakra-vite-app --template react-ts
# OR
pnpm create vite my-chakra-vite-app --template react-ts
```

This command will create a new Vite project with a React and TypeScript template. You can choose a JavaScript template if you prefer, but this guide will use TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.

## Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Once the project is created, navigate to the newly created directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd my-chakra-vite-app
```

## Step 3: Install Chakra UI and its Dependencies

Now, let's install Chakra UI and its peer dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
# OR
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
# OR
pnpm add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

Here's a breakdown of the packages we are installing:

*   `@chakra-ui/react`:  The core Chakra UI library containing all the components and hooks.
*   `@emotion/react`:  A high-performance CSS-in-JS library used by Chakra UI for styling.
*   `@emotion/styled`: A library for creating styled components with Emotion.
*   `framer-motion`:  A motion and animation library used by Chakra UI for smooth transitions and animations.

## Step 4: Configure Chakra UI Provider

To use Chakra UI components in your application, you need to wrap your root component with the `ChakraProvider`. Open your `src/main.tsx` (or `src/main.jsx` if you are using JavaScript) file and modify it as follows:

```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ChakraProvider>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

This code imports the `ChakraProvider` component from `@chakra-ui/react` and wraps the `<App />` component with it.  This makes Chakra UI components available throughout your application.

## Step 5: Test Chakra UI Components

Let's test if Chakra UI is working correctly by using a simple component. Open your `src/App.tsx` (or `src/App.jsx`) file and replace its content with the following:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Button, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Heading as="h1" size="2xl" textAlign="center" mt={8}>
        Welcome to Chakra UI with Vite!
      </Heading>
      <Button colorScheme="blue" size="lg" mt={4}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

This code imports the `Button` and `Heading` components from `@chakra-ui/react` and uses them to create a simple heading and button.  The `colorScheme` and `size` props are used to customize the appearance of the button. The `mt` prop represents margin-top and is part of the Chakra UI spacing scale.

## Step 6: Run Your Vite Project

Now, start your Vite development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev
# OR
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your application in your browser at the address displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).  You should see the heading and button rendered with Chakra UI styling.

## Step 7: Customizing the Theme (Optional)

Chakra UI allows you to customize the theme to match your application's design.  You can create a custom theme object and pass it to the `ChakraProvider`.

Create a new file named `theme.ts` (or `theme.js` if you are using JavaScript) in the `src` directory:

```tsx
// src/theme.ts
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    brand: {
      900: '#1a365d',
      800: '#153e75',
      700: '#2a69ac',
    },
  },
})

export default theme
```

This code creates a custom theme object that extends the default Chakra UI theme. It defines a new `brand` color scheme with three different shades.

Now, import the custom theme in your `src/main.tsx` file and pass it to the `ChakraProvider`:

```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import theme from './theme' // Import the custom theme

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

Finally, use the custom color scheme in your `src/App.tsx` file:

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Button, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Heading as="h1" size="2xl" textAlign="center" mt={8} color="brand.700">
        Welcome to Chakra UI with Vite!
      </Heading>
      <Button colorScheme="brand" size="lg" mt={4}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Now the button should use the custom `brand` color scheme. You can further customize the theme with fonts, sizes, breakpoints, and more. Refer to the Chakra UI documentation for a complete list of theme options.

## Step 8: Using TypeScript with Chakra UI (Recommended)

While not strictly required, using TypeScript with Chakra UI significantly improves the developer experience by providing type safety and autocompletion. The provided example uses TypeScript.  Make sure your `tsconfig.json` is configured to support JSX. Typically this is set to `"jsx": "react-jsx"` in the `compilerOptions` object.

## Best Practices

*   **Component Composition:**  Leverage Chakra UI's component composition features to create reusable and maintainable UI components.
*   **Accessibility:** Chakra UI prioritizes accessibility.  Make sure to follow accessibility best practices when using Chakra UI components.
*   **Theming:**  Take advantage of Chakra UI's theming capabilities to create a consistent and visually appealing design system.
*   **Responsive Design:** Chakra UI provides responsive props and utilities to easily create responsive layouts.
*   **Read the Documentation:** The Chakra UI documentation is comprehensive and provides detailed information on all the components and features.  Refer to it frequently.
