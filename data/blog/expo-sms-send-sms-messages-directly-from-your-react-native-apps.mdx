# Expo SMS: Send SMS Messages Directly from Your React Native Apps

Want to empower your React Native applications with the ability to send SMS messages? Look no further than the Expo SMS library! This powerful module simplifies the process of sending text messages directly from your mobile apps, offering a seamless user experience and opening up a world of possibilities. This blog post will guide you through the ins and outs of Expo SMS, including installation, usage, and common use cases, with clear and concise code examples.

## What is Expo SMS?

Expo SMS is an Expo module that allows you to send SMS messages from your React Native applications. It's part of the Expo ecosystem, meaning it's designed to work seamlessly with Expo-managed workflows and offers a consistent API across both Android and iOS.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Easy Integration:** Simple to install and configure within your Expo or React Native project.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Simplified API:** Provides a straightforward interface for sending SMS messages and checking availability.
- **Expo Ecosystem:** Benefits from Expo's robust tooling and community support.

## Use Cases for Expo SMS

The ability to send SMS messages directly from your app can be incredibly useful in various scenarios:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement secure authentication flows using SMS verification codes.
- **Appointment Reminders:** Send automated SMS reminders to users about upcoming appointments.
- **Order Confirmations:** Provide instant confirmation of orders placed through your app.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Deliver critical alerts and notifications directly to users' mobile devices.
- **Customer Support:** Enable users to initiate SMS conversations with your customer support team.
- **Social Sharing:** Allow users to easily share content from your app via SMS.
- **Referral Programs:** Implement referral programs where users can invite friends via SMS.

## Getting Started with Expo SMS

Let's dive into the process of setting up and using Expo SMS in your React Native project.

### 1. Installation

First, you need to install the `expo-sms` package using either `npm` or `yarn`:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-sms
```

or

```plaintext
yarn add expo-sms
```

This command will install the necessary dependencies and link them to your project.

### 2. Importing the Module

Import the `SMS` module from the `expo-sms` package in your React Native component:

```plaintext
import * as SMS from 'expo-sms'
```

### 3. Checking SMS Availability

Before attempting to send an SMS message, it's crucial to check if the device supports sending SMS messages. You can use the `SMS.isAvailableAsync()` function for this:

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import * as SMS from 'expo-sms'

export default function App() {
  const [isAvailable, setIsAvailable] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkAvailability = async () => {
      const isSmsAvailable = await SMS.isAvailableAsync()
      setIsAvailable(isSmsAvailable)
    }

    checkAvailability()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>SMS Availability: {isAvailable ? 'Available' : 'Not Available'}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

This code snippet checks if SMS functionality is available on the device and updates the `isAvailable` state accordingly. This allows you to display a message to the user informing them whether or not they can send SMS messages from your app.

### 4. Sending an SMS Message

The core functionality of Expo SMS is sending SMS messages. You can achieve this using the `SMS.sendSMSAsync()` function.

```plaintext
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, Text, View, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native'
import * as SMS from 'expo-sms'

export default function App() {
  const [isAvailable, setIsAvailable] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkAvailability = async () => {
      const isSmsAvailable = await SMS.isAvailableAsync()
      setIsAvailable(isSmsAvailable)
    }

    checkAvailability()
  }, [])

  const sendSMS = async () => {
    const { result } = await SMS.sendSMSAsync(
      ['1234567890', '0987654321'], // Recipient phone numbers (array)
      'Hello from my React Native app!', // Message body
      {
        attachments: {
          uri: 'https://example.com/image.png', // Replace with your image URL or local file path
          mimeType: 'image/png',
          filename: 'image.png',
        },
      }
    )

    if (result === 'sent') {
      Alert.alert('Success', 'SMS sent successfully!')
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Error', `Failed to send SMS. Result: ${result}`)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>SMS Availability: {isAvailable ? 'Available' : 'Not Available'}</Text>
      {isAvailable && <Button title="Send SMS" onPress={sendSMS} />}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `SMS.sendSMSAsync(recipients, message, options)`: This function sends the SMS message.
  - `recipients`: An array of phone numbers to send the message to.
  - `message`: The text of the SMS message.
  - `options`: An optional object containing additional settings, such as attachments.
- `attachments`: Allows you to include attachments like images in your SMS message. Keep in mind that support for attachments may vary depending on the carrier and device.
- The `result` variable indicates the outcome of the SMS sending operation. Possible values include:
  - `sent`: The message was successfully sent.
  - `cancelled`: The user cancelled the message sending process.
  - `failed`: The message failed to send.

**Important Considerations for SMS Attachments:**

- **Platform limitations:** iOS and Android handle attachments in different ways and might have different size limitations. Always test thoroughly on both platforms.
- **Carrier support:** Not all carriers support SMS attachments (MMS). If the user's carrier does not support it, the message might be sent as a regular SMS without the attachment, or it might fail completely.
- **File size:** Keep attachments small. Large files will significantly increase the time it takes to send the message and could lead to failures.
- **Permissions:** Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to access the specified file (if it's a local file).

## Handling Errors and Edge Cases

It's crucial to handle potential errors and edge cases when working with Expo SMS to provide a robust user experience.

- **SMS Not Available:** If `SMS.isAvailableAsync()` returns `false`, display a message informing the user that SMS functionality is not available on their device.
- **Message Sending Failure:** Handle the `failed` result from `SMS.sendSMSAsync()` and provide informative error messages to the user.
- **User Cancellation:** Handle the `cancelled` result from `SMS.sendSMSAsync()` gracefully, perhaps by informing the user that they cancelled the message sending process.
- **Permissions:** Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to send SMS messages. Expo handles this automatically, but you might need to request permissions explicitly in bare React Native projects.
- **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of potential rate limiting imposed by SMS providers. Avoid sending a large number of SMS messages in a short period.

## Debugging Tips

- **Use a Real Device:** SMS functionality might not work correctly in emulators or simulators. Test on a physical device for accurate results.
- **Check Your Phone Number:** Ensure that the phone number you're using to send SMS messages is valid and has sufficient credit.
- **Permissions:** Double-check that your app has the necessary SMS permissions.
- **Logs:** Use `console.log` statements to debug your code and track the flow of execution.

## Conclusion

Expo SMS provides a convenient and reliable way to integrate SMS functionality into your React Native applications. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily send SMS messages, check availability, and handle potential errors. Remember to consider the various use cases and implement appropriate error handling to create a seamless user experience. Leverage the power of SMS to enhance your mobile app's functionality and engage with your users in new and meaningful ways!
