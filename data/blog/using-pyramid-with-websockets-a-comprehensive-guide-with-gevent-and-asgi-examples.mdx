# Using Pyramid with WebSockets: A Comprehensive Guide with gevent and ASGI Examples

WebSockets provide a persistent, two-way connection between a client and a server, enabling real-time communication. This is essential for building applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications, live dashboards, and collaborative tools. Pyramid, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, doesn't natively support WebSockets but can be easily extended to do so using libraries like `gevent` or `ASGI` frameworks like `uvicorn` or `hypercorn`.

This guide will walk you through integrating WebSockets into your Pyramid application using both `gevent` and `ASGI`, providing detailed code examples for each approach.

## Why WebSockets with Pyramid?

While Pyramid is known for its flexibility and control, it doesn't include native WebSocket support in its core. Adding WebSocket functionality to Pyramid allows you to:

- **Build Real-Time Applications:** Create applications that need to push data to clients immediately without the overhead of constant polling.
- **Enhance User Experience:** Deliver a more interactive and responsive experience to your users.
- **Leverage Pyramid's Strengths:** Keep the benefits of Pyramid's structure, testability, and scalability while adding real-time capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Python 3.7 or higher is recommended.
- **pip:** Python package installer.
- **Virtualenv (Optional but recommended):** Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

## 1. Setting up a Basic Pyramid Application

First, let's create a basic Pyramid application. If you already have a Pyramid project, you can skip this step.

```bash
# Create a project directory
mkdir pyramid_websocket_example
cd pyramid_websocket_example

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install Pyramid and other essential packages
pip install pyramid waitress

# Initialize a Pyramid project
pcreate -s starter myproject
cd myproject
```

This will create a basic Pyramid project structure inside the `myproject` directory.

## 2. Implementing WebSockets with gevent

`gevent` is a coroutine-based Python networking library that allows you to easily handle concurrent operations, making it suitable for WebSocket handling. We'll use `gevent-websocket` which provides WebSocket integration for `gevent`.

### 2.1 Installing Necessary Packages

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install gevent gevent-websocket
```

### 2.2 Modifying `__init__.py`

Open your `myproject/__init__.py` file and modify it to include a WebSocket view:

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator
from pyramid.view import view_config
from pyramid.response import Response
import gevent
from gevent.pywsgi import WSGIServer
from geventwebsocket.handler import WebSocketHandler
from geventwebsocket.resource import WebSocketResource

@view_config(route_name='websocket')
def websocket_view(request):
    ws = request.environ.get('wsgi.websocket')
    if ws is None:
        return Response("This view must be accessed via WebSocket")

    while True:
        try:
            message = ws.receive()
            if message is None:  # Connection closed
                break
            print('Received: %s' % message)
            ws.send('Echo: %s' % message)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"WebSocket error: {e}")
            break

    return Response()


def main(global_config, **settings):
    """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application.
    """
    with Configurator(settings=settings) as config:
        config.include('pyramid_jinja2')
        config.include('.routes')
        config.scan()

        # Add WebSocket route
        config.add_route('websocket', '/ws')

        # Use gevent for serving
        #return config.make_wsgi_app() #Comment out original app

        # Create a Pyramid app factory
        app = config.make_wsgi_app()
        return app


```

### 2.3 Updating `routes.py`

In your `myproject/routes.py` file, you should already have something like this:

```plaintext
from pyramid.config import Configurator

def includeme(config):
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.add_static_view(name='static', path='myproject:static')
    config.scan()
```

No changes are required here for basic setup. The `config.add_route('websocket', '/ws')` in `__init__.py` handles the routing. However, if you need different routes for websockets, you can define them here.

### 2.4 Running the Application with gevent

Now, we need to modify how the application is served. Instead of using `waitress`, we'll use `gevent`'s `WSGIServer` with the `WebSocketHandler`. Note: This replaces `waitress` for the example.

Create a new file, for example, `run_gevent.py` in the root directory of your project:

```plaintext
from myproject import main
from gevent.pywsgi import WSGIServer
from geventwebsocket.handler import WebSocketHandler
from pyramid.paster import bootstrap, setup_logging
import os

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load Pyramid configuration
    env = bootstrap('development.ini')
    settings = env['registry'].settings

    # Get the Pyramid application
    application = main({}, **settings)

    # Create a gevent WSGIServer with WebSocketHandler
    server = WSGIServer(
        ('0.0.0.0', 6543),  # Listen on all interfaces, port 6543
        application,
        handler_class=WebSocketHandler
    )

    # Start the server
    print("Starting gevent WebSocket server on port 6543...")
    server.serve_forever()
```

Now, run the application using:

```bash
python run_gevent.py
```

This will start the `gevent` server, listening for WebSocket connections on port 6543.

### 2.5 Testing the WebSocket Connection

You can test the WebSocket connection using a simple JavaScript client in your browser. Create an `index.html` file inside `myproject/static`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Pyramid WebSocket Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>WebSocket Example</h1>
    <input type="text" id="messageInput" placeholder="Enter message" />
    <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
    <div id="output"></div>

    <script>
      var websocket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:6543/ws')

      websocket.onopen = function (event) {
        console.log('WebSocket connection opened.')
      }

      websocket.onmessage = function (event) {
        console.log('Received: ' + event.data)
        document.getElementById('output').innerHTML += '<br>Received: ' + event.data
      }

      websocket.onclose = function (event) {
        console.log('WebSocket connection closed.')
      }

      function sendMessage() {
        var message = document.getElementById('messageInput').value
        websocket.send(message)
        document.getElementById('output').innerHTML += '<br>Sent: ' + message
        document.getElementById('messageInput').value = ''
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:6543/static/index.html` in your browser. Enter a message and click "Send". You should see the echoed message appear below.

## 3. Implementing WebSockets with ASGI

ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a standard interface between asynchronous Python web servers, frameworks, and applications. Using ASGI allows you to leverage asynchronous features, potentially improving performance and scalability.

### 3.1 Installing Necessary Packages

For ASGI integration, we'll use `aiohttp` and an ASGI server such as `uvicorn` or `hypercorn`.

```bash
pip install aiohttp uvicorn
```

You can also install `hypercorn` as an alternative to `uvicorn`. Choose one.

### 3.2 Creating an ASGI Application

Since Pyramid is a WSGI application, we'll need to wrap it in an ASGI application. We'll use `asgiref` for this.

```bash
pip install asgiref
```

Create a new file, for example, `asgi.py` in the root directory of your project:

```plaintext
import asyncio
import aiohttp.web
from aiohttp import web
from pyramid.paster import bootstrap, setup_logging
from asgiref.wsgi import WsgiToAsgi

# Pyramid application factory
def create_pyramid_app():
    env = bootstrap('development.ini')
    settings = env['registry'].settings
    from myproject import main
    return main({}, **settings)


# Wrap Pyramid app in an ASGI adapter
asgi_app = WsgiToAsgi(create_pyramid_app())


async def websocket_handler(request):
    ws = web.WebSocketResponse()
    await ws.prepare(request)

    async for msg in ws:
        if msg.type == aiohttp.WSMsgType.TEXT:
            print(f"Received: {msg.data}")
            await ws.send_str(f"Echo: {msg.data}")
        elif msg.type == aiohttp.WSMsgType.CLOSED:
            print('WebSocket connection closed')
            break
        elif msg.type == aiohttp.WSMsgType.ERROR:
            print(f'WebSocket error: {ws.exception()}')

    return ws


async def app_factory():
    app = web.Application()
    app.add_routes([web.get('/ws', websocket_handler)])
    return app

# Add the Pyramid WSGI app as a fallback route.  This makes it so
# requests that are not '/ws' are handled by the pyramid WSGI app.
async def wsgi_handler(request):
    return web.Response(body=await asgi_app(request.scope, request.receive, request.send))

async def asgi_entrypoint(scope, receive, send):
    if scope["type"] == "http":
        request = aiohttp.web.Request(scope, receive)
        if request.path == '/ws':
            await websocket_handler(request)
        else:
            await asgi_app(scope, receive, send) # Pass to Pyramid WSGI
    elif scope["type"] == "websocket":
        request = aiohttp.web.Request(scope, receive)
        await websocket_handler(request)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported scope type: {scope['type']}")



# Use this entrypoint for uvicorn or hypercorn
app = asgi_entrypoint
```

### 3.3 Running the Application with Uvicorn

Now you can run the application using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn asgi:app --reload
```

This starts the `uvicorn` server, listening for WebSocket connections on port 8000 (default). The `--reload` flag enables automatic reloading of the server when code changes are detected.

### 3.4 Running the Application with Hypercorn

Alternatively, you can use `hypercorn`:

```bash
hypercorn asgi:app --reload
```

### 3.5 Testing the WebSocket Connection

Use the same `index.html` file from the gevent example (making sure to adjust the WebSocket URL if necessary). Modify the line in `index.html`:

```html
var websocket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/ws");
```

Navigate to your Pyramid application's homepage (e.g., `http://localhost:6543`) and access `myproject/static/index.html` from there. Now, you should be able to send and receive messages via the WebSocket using the ASGI server.

## Differences Between Gevent and ASGI

- **Concurrency Model:** `gevent` uses cooperative multitasking (green threads), while ASGI uses asynchronous programming with `async/await`.
- **Performance:** ASGI can offer better performance in some scenarios due to its asynchronous nature and ability to leverage multiple cores more effectively, particularly with optimized ASGI servers like `uvicorn` or `hypercorn`.
- **Compatibility:** `gevent` is generally simpler to integrate with existing synchronous code, but ASGI is the modern standard for asynchronous Python web applications and is supported by a wider range of libraries and frameworks. Integrating a WSGI application like Pyramid with ASGI requires the use of adapters like `WsgiToAsgi`.
- **Ecosystem:** ASGI is part of the larger `asyncio` ecosystem and is the recommended approach for new projects focusing on high performance and scalability. `gevent` is a mature project, but less actively developed in recent years in favor of async libraries.

## Choosing the Right Approach

- **Gevent:** Consider `gevent` if you need a simpler integration path, already have `gevent` dependencies in your project, or are dealing with legacy code. It's generally easier to get started with for simple WebSocket applications.
- **ASGI:** Choose ASGI for new projects, for maximum performance and scalability, or when you need to leverage asynchronous features beyond WebSockets. It requires more upfront setup but offers significant advantages in the long run. It also provides better integration with modern Python libraries and frameworks.

## Conclusion

This guide has demonstrated how to integrate WebSockets into your Pyramid application using both `gevent` and ASGI. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, so choose the one that best suits your project's requirements. By adding WebSocket functionality, you can build real-time applications and deliver a more engaging and responsive user experience. Remember to carefully consider your application's performance needs and choose the appropriate server (e.g., `uvicorn`, `hypercorn`) for optimal performance.
