# Testing Vue Router Navigation Guards: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

Vue Router's navigation guards are crucial for controlling access and manipulating navigation within your Vue.js application. They allow you to perform actions _before_, _during_, and _after_ a route changes, enabling functionalities like authentication checks, data fetching, and analytics tracking. However, ensuring these guards function correctly requires thorough testing. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to effectively test Vue Router navigation guards using popular testing libraries like Vue Test Utils, Vitest, and Jest.

## What are Vue Router Navigation Guards?

Navigation guards are functions that intercept route navigation and can be used to:

- **`beforeEach`**: Executed before every route change. Ideal for global authentication checks or analytics.
- **`beforeResolve`**: Similar to `beforeEach`, but called after all in-component guards have been resolved. Useful for fetching data required before the component is fully rendered.
- **`afterEach`**: Executed after a route change is completed. Commonly used for logging route transitions or updating the document title.

These guards provide powerful mechanisms for controlling your application's routing behavior, making testing their correctness essential for stability and security.

## Why Test Navigation Guards?

Testing navigation guards is vital for:

- **Ensuring Authentication Logic:** Verify that users are correctly redirected to login pages when not authenticated and can access protected routes when authorized.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access:** Confirm that unauthorized users are prevented from accessing sensitive parts of your application.
- **Validating Data Fetching:** Guarantee that necessary data is fetched before a route is activated, preventing errors and ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Maintaining Application Stability:** Robust tests catch unexpected errors or logic flaws in navigation guards, preventing runtime issues and crashes.
- **Facilitating Refactoring:** Well-tested guards allow you to refactor your code with confidence, knowing that your tests will catch any regressions.

## Setting up your testing environment

Before diving into testing examples, let's ensure your testing environment is properly configured. We'll assume you're using Vue Test Utils and either Vitest or Jest.

**Installation (Example using npm with Vitest):**

```plaintext
npm install -D @vue/test-utils vitest jsdom
```

**Configuration (Example `vite.config.js` for Vitest):**

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
  },
})
```

**Note:** Adjust installation commands and configurations according to your project's package manager (yarn, pnpm) and testing framework (Jest). For Jest, you'll typically use `vue-jest` for Vue component compilation.

## Testing `beforeEach` Navigation Guards

Let's start with the most common guard: `beforeEach`. This guard is ideal for handling authentication.

**Example `beforeEach` Guard:**

```javascript
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue'
import LoginView from '../views/LoginView.vue'

const routes = [
  { path: '/', name: 'home', component: HomeView, meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
  { path: '/login', name: 'login', component: LoginView },
  {
    path: '/admin',
    name: 'admin',
    component: { template: '<div>Admin</div>' },
    meta: { requiresAuth: true, requiresAdmin: true },
  },
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
})

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  const isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem('token') // Replace with your authentication logic
  const isAdmin = localStorage.getItem('isAdmin') === 'true'
  const requiresAuth = to.matched.some((record) => record.meta.requiresAuth)
  const requiresAdmin = to.matched.some((record) => record.meta.requiresAdmin)

  if (requiresAuth && !isLoggedIn) {
    next('/login')
  } else if (requiresAdmin && !isAdmin) {
    next('/')
  } else {
    next()
  }
})

export default router
```

**Testing the `beforeEach` Guard:**

```javascript
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import { createMemoryHistory } from 'vue-router'
import App from './App.vue' // Replace with your main App component
import HomeView from './views/HomeView.vue'
import LoginView from './views/LoginView.vue'
import { beforeEach } from 'vitest'

// Mock the localStorage for testing
const localStorageMock = {
  getItem: vi.fn(),
  setItem: vi.fn(),
  removeItem: vi.fn(),
  clear: vi.fn(),
}
global.localStorage = localStorageMock

describe('beforeEach Navigation Guard', () => {
  let router

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Reset localStorage before each test
    localStorageMock.getItem.mockReset()
    localStorageMock.setItem.mockReset()
    localStorageMock.removeItem.mockReset()
    localStorageMock.clear.mockReset()

    const routes = [
      { path: '/', name: 'home', component: HomeView, meta: { requiresAuth: true } },
      { path: '/login', name: 'login', component: LoginView },
      {
        path: '/admin',
        name: 'admin',
        component: { template: '<div>Admin</div>' },
        meta: { requiresAuth: true, requiresAdmin: true },
      },
    ]

    router = createRouter({
      history: createMemoryHistory(), // Use createMemoryHistory for testing
      routes,
    })

    // Install the router (Important! Install the router before mounting)
    //Vue.use(VueRouter)  // For Vue 2, replace with app.use(router) for Vue 3
  })

  it('redirects to /login when accessing a protected route without being logged in', async () => {
    localStorageMock.getItem.mockReturnValue(null) // Mock not logged in
    router.push('/') // Attempt to navigate to a protected route
    await router.isReady()
    expect(router.currentRoute.value.path).toBe('/login')
  })

  it('allows navigation to a protected route when logged in', async () => {
    localStorageMock.getItem.mockReturnValue('mockToken') // Mock logged in
    router.push('/')
    await router.isReady()
    expect(router.currentRoute.value.path).toBe('/')
  })

  it('redirects to /login when attempting to access a protected route without a token', async () => {
    localStorageMock.getItem.mockImplementation((key) => {
      if (key === 'token') {
        return null // No token
      }
      return null // Handle other keys if needed
    })

    await router.push('/')
    await router.isReady()
    expect(router.currentRoute.value.path).toBe('/login')
  })

  it('redirects from /admin to / when not an admin', async () => {
    localStorageMock.getItem.mockImplementation((key) => {
      if (key === 'token') {
        return 'someToken' // mock logged in
      }
      if (key === 'isAdmin') {
        return null // mock not an admin
      }
      return null
    })

    await router.push('/admin')
    await router.isReady()
    expect(router.currentRoute.value.path).toBe('/')
  })

  it('allows navigation to /admin when logged in as admin', async () => {
    localStorageMock.getItem.mockImplementation((key) => {
      if (key === 'token') {
        return 'someToken' // mock logged in
      }
      if (key === 'isAdmin') {
        return 'true' // mock is an admin
      }
      return null
    })

    await router.push('/admin')
    await router.isReady()
    expect(router.currentRoute.value.path).toBe('/admin')
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Mock `localStorage`:** The example mocks `localStorage` using `vi.fn()` (from Vitest) or `jest.fn()` (from Jest) to control the authentication state. This is essential for isolating the guard's logic. If your authentication relies on cookies, you'd need to mock those as well.
2.  **`createMemoryHistory`:** We use `createMemoryHistory` instead of `createWebHistory`. This is because `createWebHistory` interacts with the browser's address bar, which isn't available in a testing environment. `createMemoryHistory` keeps track of the navigation history in memory.
3.  **Install the Router:** This step is _crucial_. You need to install the router instance into your Vue application before mounting components that use the router. For Vue 3, use `app.use(router)` within the test setup. If you are using Vue 2, you should use Vue.use(VueRouter) and then inject the router in the created method of your component.
4.  **`router.push()`:** We use `router.push()` to trigger route navigation within the test.
5.  **`router.isReady()`:** `router.isReady()` waits for the router to be initialized and the initial navigation to complete. This is vital to ensure that your assertions are performed after the guard has executed.
6.  **Assertions:** We use `expect(router.currentRoute.value.path).toBe('/login')` (or equivalent) to assert the expected route after the guard has been executed.

## Testing `beforeResolve` Navigation Guards

`beforeResolve` guards are executed _after_ all in-component guards have been resolved, but _before_ the navigation is confirmed. This is useful for fetching data that's required before a component is fully rendered.

**Example `beforeResolve` Guard:**

```javascript
// In router.js
router.beforeResolve(async (to, from, next) => {
  if (to.meta.requiresData) {
    try {
      const data = await fetchData() // Assume fetchData is an API call
      to.params.data = data // Pass the data to the route
      next()
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error)
      next(false) // Abort navigation on error
    }
  } else {
    next()
  }
})

async function fetchData() {
  // Simulate API call
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({ message: 'Data from API' })
    }, 50)
  })
}
```

**Testing the `beforeResolve` Guard:**

```javascript
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import { createMemoryHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { beforeEach } from 'vitest'

// Mock fetchData function
const mockFetchData = vi.fn()

describe('beforeResolve Navigation Guard', () => {
  let router

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockFetchData.mockReset()

    const routes = [
      {
        path: '/data',
        name: 'data',
        component: { template: '<div>Data: {{ $route.params.data.message }}</div>' },
        meta: { requiresData: true },
      },
    ]

    router = createRouter({
      history: createMemoryHistory(),
      routes,
    })

    router.beforeResolve(async (to, from, next) => {
      if (to.meta.requiresData) {
        try {
          const data = await mockFetchData()
          to.params.data = data
          next()
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error)
          next(false) // Abort navigation on error
        }
      } else {
        next()
      }
    })
  })

  it('fetches data and passes it to the route', async () => {
    mockFetchData.mockResolvedValue({ message: 'Test Data' })

    router.push('/data')
    await router.isReady()

    // Check if fetchData was called
    expect(mockFetchData).toHaveBeenCalled()

    // Assert that the data is passed to the route
    expect(router.currentRoute.value.params.data).toEqual({ message: 'Test Data' })
  })

  it('aborts navigation if data fetching fails', async () => {
    mockFetchData.mockRejectedValue(new Error('Failed to fetch'))

    router.push('/data')
    await router.isReady()

    // Assert that the navigation was aborted (e.g., redirected to an error page or stayed on the same page)
    // In this example, we'll check that it remains on the initial route
    expect(router.currentRoute.value.path).not.toBe('/data') // Verify it didn't navigate to /data
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Mock `fetchData`:** We mock the `fetchData` function using `vi.fn()` or `jest.fn()` to control the data returned and simulate success or failure scenarios.
2.  **`mockResolvedValue` and `mockRejectedValue`:** These methods on the mocked function allow us to simulate successful data fetching (returning a resolved promise) or failed data fetching (returning a rejected promise).
3.  **Assertions:** We assert that `fetchData` was called and that the data is correctly passed to the route's `params` object. We also test the error handling logic when data fetching fails.

## Testing `afterEach` Navigation Guards

`afterEach` guards are executed _after_ the navigation has been confirmed. They're typically used for side effects like analytics tracking or updating the document title.

**Example `afterEach` Guard:**

```javascript
// In router.js
router.afterEach((to, from) => {
  document.title = to.meta.title || 'My App' // Update document title
  console.log(`Navigated from ${from.path} to ${to.path}`) // Log navigation
  // ... other analytics or tracking code
})
```

**Testing the `afterEach` Guard:**

```javascript
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import { createMemoryHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { beforeEach } from 'vitest'

describe('afterEach Navigation Guard', () => {
  let router
  let originalTitle

  beforeEach(() => {
    originalTitle = document.title

    const routes = [
      {
        path: '/',
        name: 'home',
        component: { template: '<div>Home</div>' },
        meta: { title: 'Home Page' },
      },
      {
        path: '/about',
        name: 'about',
        component: { template: '<div>About</div>' },
        meta: { title: 'About Us' },
      },
    ]

    router = createRouter({
      history: createMemoryHistory(),
      routes,
    })
  })

  afterEach(() => {
    document.title = originalTitle // Restore the original title after each test
  })

  it('updates the document title after navigation', async () => {
    router.afterEach((to, from) => {
      document.title = to.meta.title || 'My App'
    })

    router.push('/about')
    await router.isReady()

    expect(document.title).toBe('About Us')
  })
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Store and Restore `document.title`:** The tests back up the original document title before each test and restore it afterward. This prevents tests from interfering with each other.
2.  **Assertions:** We assert that the document title is updated correctly after navigation. You can also mock `console.log` to verify that logging is performed correctly.

## Best Practices for Testing Navigation Guards

- **Isolate Guards:** Focus on testing the guard's logic in isolation. Mock external dependencies (API calls, authentication services, etc.) to avoid relying on real-world systems during testing.
- **Test All Scenarios:** Cover all possible scenarios, including successful navigation, aborted navigation, error conditions, and different user roles/permissions.
- **Use `createMemoryHistory`:** Always use `createMemoryHistory` for testing to avoid interacting with the browser's address bar.
- **Use `router.isReady()`:** Ensure that you await `router.isReady()` before making assertions to allow the router to initialize and the guards to execute.
- **Comprehensive Assertions:** Use detailed assertions to verify that the expected behavior is happening, including route transitions, data modifications, and side effects.
- **Test Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases, such as navigating to the same route, handling invalid routes, and dealing with unexpected errors.
- **Keep Tests Readable:** Write clear and concise tests that are easy to understand and maintain. Use descriptive test names and comments to explain the purpose of each test.
- **Avoid Global State:** Reset any global state (e.g., `localStorage`, `document.title`) after each test to prevent interference between tests.
- **Spy on Functions:** Use `vi.spyOn` or `jest.spyOn` to track calls to functions within your guards, which can be helpful for verifying that certain actions are being performed.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Forgetting to Install the Router:** This is a common mistake that leads to errors when components try to access the router. Always ensure that you install the router instance before mounting components.
- **Not Using `router.isReady()`:** Asserting before the router is ready can lead to false negatives because the guards haven't had a chance to execute. Wait for `router.isReady()` before making assertions.
- **Not Mocking External Dependencies:** Relying on real-world dependencies during testing can make your tests brittle and unreliable. Mock all external dependencies to isolate the guard's logic.
- **Using `createWebHistory` in Tests:** This will cause errors because the browser's address bar is not available in a testing environment. Use `createMemoryHistory` instead.

## Conclusion

Testing Vue Router navigation guards is crucial for building robust and secure Vue.js applications. By following the best practices and examples outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your navigation logic functions correctly and prevent unexpected errors. Remember to isolate your guards, test all scenarios, and write clear, maintainable tests. Happy testing!
