# Hamburger React Component: Create Stylish & Accessible Navigation Menus

In today's mobile-first world, a clean and intuitive navigation menu is crucial for a positive user experience. The hamburger menu, represented by three horizontal lines, has become a widely recognized icon for collapsing and expanding navigation options on smaller screens. While building a hamburger menu from scratch can be time-consuming, the `hamburger-react` component provides a simple and efficient solution for implementing accessible and visually appealing navigation in your React applications.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about `hamburger-react`, from installation and basic usage to advanced customization and accessibility considerations.

## What is `hamburger-react`?

`hamburger-react` is a lightweight and flexible React component that renders a customizable hamburger icon. It provides built-in animations, accessibility features, and styling options, making it easy to integrate into your existing React projects. The core principle of `hamburger-react` is to handle the visual representation of the hamburger menu button, leaving you to manage the state and logic of the menu itself.

## Why Choose `hamburger-react`?

Here's why `hamburger-react` should be your go-to choice for creating hamburger menus:

- **Simple and Easy to Use:** The component has a straightforward API, making it easy to integrate into your React projects.
- **Customizable:** You can customize the color, size, animation, and other visual aspects of the hamburger icon to match your brand's style.
- **Accessible:** `hamburger-react` includes built-in accessibility features, such as ARIA attributes, ensuring that your navigation is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Lightweight:** The component has a small footprint, minimizing its impact on your application's performance.
- **Responsive:** The component works seamlessly on different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## Installation

To install `hamburger-react`, use npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install hamburger-react
# or
yarn add hamburger-react
```

## Basic Usage

Import the `Hamburger` component into your React component and render it. You'll need to manage the state that controls whether the menu is open or closed and pass that state to `hamburger-react`. Also, provide an `onToggle` function that updates the state when the hamburger icon is clicked.

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Hamburger from 'hamburger-react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <Hamburger toggled={isOpen} toggle={setIsOpen} />
      {isOpen && (
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="/">Home</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/about">About</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/services">Services</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example:

- We import the `Hamburger` component from `hamburger-react`.
- We use the `useState` hook to manage the `isOpen` state, which indicates whether the menu is open or closed.
- We pass the `isOpen` state to the `toggled` prop of the `Hamburger` component.
- We pass the `setIsOpen` function to the `toggle` prop of the `Hamburger` component. This allows `hamburger-react` to update the state when the hamburger icon is clicked.
- We conditionally render the navigation menu based on the `isOpen` state.

## Customization Options

`hamburger-react` offers a variety of props to customize its appearance and behavior. Here are some of the most commonly used props:

- **`toggled`:** A boolean value indicating whether the hamburger icon is in the active (transformed) state. Required.
- **`toggle`:** A function that is called when the hamburger icon is clicked. This function should update the state that controls whether the menu is open or closed. Required.
- **`size`:** The size of the hamburger icon in pixels. Defaults to 32.
- **`color`:** The color of the hamburger icon. Defaults to `black`. You can use any valid CSS color value.
- **`rounded`:** A boolean value indicating whether the hamburger icon should have rounded corners. Defaults to `false`.
- **`hideOutline`:** A boolean value indicating whether the outline of the hamburger icon should be hidden on focus. Defaults to `false`. Helpful for styling with CSS focus states instead of relying on the browser default.
- **`label`:** Sets the aria-label for the button. Useful for accessibility. Defaults to `Menu`.
- **`duration`:** The duration of the animation when the hamburger icon transitions between the active and inactive states, in seconds. Defaults to `0.4`.
- **`easing`:** The easing function to use for the animation. Defaults to `ease`. Valid options include any CSS `transition-timing-function` value.

Here's an example of how to customize the `Hamburger` component:

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Hamburger from 'hamburger-react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <Hamburger
        toggled={isOpen}
        toggle={setIsOpen}
        size={48}
        color="white"
        rounded
        hideOutline={true}
        label="Open Navigation Menu"
        duration={0.8}
        easing="ease-in-out"
      />
      {isOpen && (
        <nav style={{ backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)', padding: '20px', color: 'white' }}>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="/" style={{ color: 'white', textDecoration: 'none' }}>
                Home
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/about" style={{ color: 'white', textDecoration: 'none' }}>
                About
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/services" style={{ color: 'white', textDecoration: 'none' }}>
                Services
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="/contact" style={{ color: 'white', textDecoration: 'none' }}>
                Contact
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example, we've customized the hamburger icon with:

- A larger size (`size={48}`)
- A white color (`color="white"`)
- Rounded corners (`rounded`)
- Hidden outline on focus (`hideOutline={true}`)
- A custom aria-label (`label="Open Navigation Menu"`)
- A longer animation duration (`duration={0.8}`)
- A custom easing function (`easing="ease-in-out"`)

We've also added basic styling to the navigation menu itself for better visual appeal.

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is a critical aspect of web development. `hamburger-react` takes accessibility seriously by providing:

- **ARIA attributes:** The component includes ARIA attributes that provide semantic information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
- **Keyboard navigation:** The component is fully navigable using the keyboard. It's important to ensure your menu itself is also navigable with the keyboard.
- **Customizable `label` prop:** The `label` prop allows you to provide a descriptive label for the hamburger icon, making it easier for users of screen readers to understand its purpose. Use a meaningful label!

When implementing a hamburger menu, always consider the following accessibility best practices:

- **Provide alternative text for the icon:** Use the `label` prop to provide a descriptive label for the hamburger icon.
- **Ensure keyboard accessibility:** Make sure that users can navigate the menu using the keyboard.
- **Use semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML elements, such as `<nav>` and `<ul>`, to structure your navigation menu.
- **Test with assistive technologies:** Test your implementation with screen readers and other assistive technologies to ensure that it is accessible to all users.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using `hamburger-react`:

- **Manage state effectively:** Use React's state management mechanisms (e.g., `useState`, `useReducer`, or a global state management library) to manage the state of the menu effectively.
- **Use CSS for styling:** Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components, emotion) to style the hamburger icon and the navigation menu. Avoid inline styles where possible for better maintainability.
- **Optimize for performance:** Optimize your implementation for performance, especially on mobile devices. Consider using techniques such as code splitting and lazy loading to reduce the initial load time of your application.
- **Test thoroughly:** Test your implementation thoroughly on different devices and browsers to ensure that it works as expected.

## Advanced Examples

Here are some advanced examples of how you can use `hamburger-react`:

- **Using with a Navigation Drawer:** Combine `hamburger-react` with a sliding navigation drawer for a more sophisticated mobile navigation experience.
- **Integrating with a CSS Framework:** Integrate `hamburger-react` with popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for consistent styling and layout.
- **Creating a Sticky Header:** Combine `hamburger-react` with a sticky header that remains visible as the user scrolls down the page.

### Integrating with Tailwind CSS

```plaintext
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Hamburger from 'hamburger-react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div className="relative">
      <Hamburger
        toggled={isOpen}
        toggle={setIsOpen}
        size={32}
        color="#fff"
        className="absolute top-4 right-4 z-10" // Tailwind classes for positioning
      />
      {isOpen && (
        <div className="bg-opacity-75 fixed top-0 left-0 z-50 flex h-screen w-full items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
          <nav className="text-white">
            <ul className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
              <li>
                <a href="/" className="hover:text-gray-300">
                  Home
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="/about" className="hover:text-gray-300">
                  About
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="/services" className="hover:text-gray-300">
                  Services
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="/contact" className="hover:text-gray-300">
                  Contact
                </a>
              </li>
              <button
                onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}
                className="rounded bg-red-500 px-4 py-2 font-bold text-white hover:bg-red-700"
              >
                Close Menu
              </button>
            </ul>
          </nav>
        </div>
      )}
      {/* Your page content */}
      <div className="p-4">
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is an example of using Hamburger React with Tailwind CSS.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

In this example, we use Tailwind CSS classes to:

- Position the hamburger icon in the top right corner of the screen.
- Style the navigation menu with a dark background and white text.
- Create a full-screen overlay for the navigation menu.
- Center the navigation items in the overlay.
