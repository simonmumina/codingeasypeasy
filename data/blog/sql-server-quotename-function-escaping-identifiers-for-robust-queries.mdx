# SQL Server QUOTENAME() Function: Escaping Identifiers for Robust Queries

Working with databases, especially SQL Server, requires careful attention to detail when constructing SQL queries.  One often overlooked but crucial aspect is properly handling database object identifiers, such as table names, column names, and stored procedure names.  These identifiers can contain special characters or reserved keywords that can cause errors or even expose your application to SQL injection vulnerabilities.  The `QUOTENAME()` function in SQL Server provides a simple yet powerful way to escape these identifiers, ensuring your queries are robust and secure.

This comprehensive guide will delve into the `QUOTENAME()` function, exploring its syntax, usage, and practical applications. We'll cover different delimiter options, demonstrate how to use it effectively, and discuss its importance in preventing security risks.

## What is the QUOTENAME() Function?

The `QUOTENAME()` function in SQL Server takes a string (typically representing a database object identifier) as input and returns a Unicode string with delimiters added to make the identifier valid.  It essentially wraps the input string within square brackets `[]` by default, effectively escaping any special characters or reserved keywords it might contain. This prevents the SQL Server parser from misinterpreting the identifier.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of the `QUOTENAME()` function is as follows:

```sql
QUOTENAME ( 'string' [ , 'quote_character' ] )
```

Let's break down the parameters:

*   **`'string'`**: This is the input string that represents the database object identifier you want to escape.  This is a required parameter.
*   **`'quote_character'`**: This is an optional parameter specifying the delimiter character to use for quoting.  By default, this is the square bracket `[]`. You can use other delimiters like single quotes `'`, double quotes `"` , or parentheses `()`.

## Understanding Delimiters

The delimiter character is the symbol used to surround the identifier.  The most common and recommended delimiter for SQL Server is the square bracket `[]`. However, `QUOTENAME()` allows you to use other delimiters depending on your needs and the specific requirements of your SQL dialect.

Here's a breakdown of common delimiters and their implications:

*   **Square Brackets `[]` (Default):**  This is the standard and preferred delimiter for SQL Server.  It is the most reliable way to escape identifiers containing spaces, special characters, or reserved keywords.

*   **Single Quotes `''`:** Single quotes are primarily used for string literals, not for escaping identifiers. While they might work in some cases, they are not recommended for this purpose and can lead to confusion.  Using `QUOTENAME()` with single quotes will escape the string, but it doesn't guarantee proper identifier handling.

*   **Double Quotes `""`:**  Double quotes are typically used for identifier quoting in ANSI SQL and other database systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL. While SQL Server supports double quotes for identifiers *if* the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` option is set to `ON`, it is generally better to stick with square brackets for consistency and portability within SQL Server.

*   **Parentheses `()`:**  Parentheses are generally used for function calls, subqueries, and grouping expressions.  Using them as delimiters for identifiers is highly unusual and generally not recommended.

## Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of how to use the `QUOTENAME()` function:

**1. Escaping a Table Name with a Space:**

Suppose you have a table named "My Table With Spaces".  If you try to use this name directly in a query, SQL Server will likely throw an error because it misinterprets the spaces.  `QUOTENAME()` solves this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   dbo.QUOTENAME('My Table With Spaces');
```

This will result in an error because `QUOTENAME()` needs to be used with `EXEC` or dynamic SQL. The correct way is:

```sql
DECLARE @TableName NVARCHAR(255) = 'My Table With Spaces';
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @SQL = 'SELECT * FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@TableName);

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
```

This code dynamically builds the SQL query, escaping the table name using `QUOTENAME()`. The resulting SQL query that gets executed is:

```sql
SELECT * FROM [My Table With Spaces]
```

**2. Escaping a Column Name with a Special Character:**

Consider a column named "Data#Value". The `#` character might cause parsing issues.

```sql
DECLARE @ColumnName NVARCHAR(255) = 'Data#Value';
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @SQL = 'SELECT ' + QUOTENAME(@ColumnName) + ' FROM MyTable';

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
```

The generated and executed SQL query will be:

```sql
SELECT [Data#Value] FROM MyTable
```

**3. Using a Different Delimiter (Double Quotes):**

While not recommended for general SQL Server use, let's see how to use double quotes. Note: you'll need to ensure `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` is set to `ON` for this to work reliably.

```sql
DECLARE @TableName NVARCHAR(255) = 'MyTable';
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @SQL = 'SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON; SELECT * FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@TableName, '"');

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
```

The executed query is:

```sql
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON; SELECT * FROM "MyTable"
```

**Important Note:** Using `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` is generally discouraged unless you have a very specific reason.  It can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.  Stick to square brackets for most SQL Server scenarios.

**4.  Working with Stored Procedure Names:**

Escaping stored procedure names is also crucial, especially when dealing with dynamically generated SQL:

```sql
DECLARE @ProcName NVARCHAR(255) = 'sp_MyProc With Spaces';
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @SQL = 'EXEC ' + QUOTENAME(@ProcName);

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
```

This executes the stored procedure even if its name contains spaces.

**5. Handling Reserved Keywords:**

If an identifier clashes with a SQL Server reserved keyword (e.g., "ORDER"), `QUOTENAME()` will properly escape it:

```sql
DECLARE @ColumnName NVARCHAR(255) = 'ORDER';
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @SQL = 'SELECT ' + QUOTENAME(@ColumnName) + ' FROM MyTable';

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
```

The resulting SQL will be:

```sql
SELECT [ORDER] FROM MyTable
```

## Preventing SQL Injection

The `QUOTENAME()` function plays a vital role in preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.  SQL injection occurs when malicious users can inject arbitrary SQL code into your queries, potentially allowing them to bypass security measures, access sensitive data, or even execute system commands.

By properly escaping identifiers using `QUOTENAME()`, you ensure that any user-supplied input intended as a database object name is treated as a literal string and not as executable SQL code.  This prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL into your queries by crafting input that contains SQL commands disguised as identifier names.

**Example of a Vulnerable Code (Without `QUOTENAME()`):**

```sql
-- DANGEROUS!  Vulnerable to SQL Injection
DECLARE @TableName NVARCHAR(255);
SET @TableName = @UserInput;  -- User input directly assigned to @TableName

DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);
SET @SQL = 'SELECT * FROM ' + @TableName;  -- Directly concatenating user input

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
```

In this vulnerable code, if a user provides the input `MyTable; DROP TABLE Users;`, the resulting SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM MyTable; DROP TABLE Users;
```

This would drop the `Users` table, causing significant data loss.

**Example of Secure Code (Using `QUOTENAME()`):**

```sql
-- SECURE!  Protected against SQL Injection
DECLARE @TableName NVARCHAR(255);
SET @TableName = @UserInput;  -- User input

DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);
SET @SQL = 'SELECT * FROM ' + QUOTENAME(@TableName);  -- Using QUOTENAME()

EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
```

With `QUOTENAME()`, the same malicious input `MyTable; DROP TABLE Users;` would result in the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM [MyTable; DROP TABLE Users;]
```

This query would simply attempt to select data from a table named `[MyTable; DROP TABLE Users;]`, which likely doesn't exist, preventing the SQL injection attack.

## Best Practices

*   **Always use `QUOTENAME()` when dealing with user-supplied input that will be used as a database object identifier.** This is the most crucial step in preventing SQL injection related to identifiers.

*   **Prefer square brackets `[]` as the delimiter.** They are the standard and most reliable option for SQL Server.

*   **Use `QUOTENAME()` within dynamic SQL constructs.** When building SQL queries dynamically, ensure that all identifiers are properly escaped.

*   **Validate user input.** While `QUOTENAME()` helps prevent SQL injection, it's still good practice to validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths.  This adds an extra layer of security.

*   **Consider using parameterized queries whenever possible.**  Parameterized queries are generally the best defense against SQL injection because they treat all input as data, not as executable code.  However, in situations where you need to dynamically build SQL queries with variable identifiers, `QUOTENAME()` becomes essential.

## Limitations

While `QUOTENAME()` is powerful, it does have a few limitations:

*   **Limited Input Length:** The `QUOTENAME()` function has a maximum input string length of 128 characters for SQL Server versions before SQL Server 2017 and 65535 characters for SQL Server 2017 and later. If your identifier exceeds this length, the function will truncate the string.  You should validate identifier lengths before passing them to `QUOTENAME()`.

*   **It only escapes identifiers:** `QUOTENAME()` is specifically designed for escaping database object identifiers.  It does *not* escape string literals or other data types. For string literals, use proper string escaping techniques (e.g., replacing single quotes with two single quotes).

*   **It doesn't validate identifier validity:** `QUOTENAME()` simply adds delimiters. It does not check if the resulting escaped identifier is actually a valid identifier in your database. It's your responsibility to ensure that the identifier follows the naming conventions and rules of your database system.

## Conclusion

The `QUOTENAME()` function is an indispensable tool for building robust and secure SQL Server applications. By properly escaping database object identifiers, you can prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities and ensure that your queries execute correctly, even when dealing with identifiers containing spaces, special characters, or reserved keywords. Understanding its syntax, usage, and limitations is crucial for any SQL Server developer.  Remember to prioritize security and always use `QUOTENAME()` when handling user-supplied input that could be used as an identifier in your SQL queries.
