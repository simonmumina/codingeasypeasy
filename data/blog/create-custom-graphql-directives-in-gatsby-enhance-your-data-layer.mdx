# Create Custom GraphQL Directives in Gatsby: Enhance Your Data Layer

Gatsby's powerful data layer is built upon GraphQL, allowing you to query and transform data from various sources. While Gatsby provides a solid foundation, you might encounter situations where you need to customize GraphQL's behavior beyond its default capabilities. That's where custom GraphQL directives come in.

Custom directives let you add metadata to your GraphQL schema and resolvers, influencing how data is fetched, transformed, or even filtered. This blog post will guide you through creating and using custom GraphQL directives within your Gatsby project to supercharge your data layer.

## What are GraphQL Directives?

GraphQL directives are markers that modify the execution of a GraphQL query or schema definition. They begin with the `@` symbol and are followed by the directive's name and any arguments. Think of them as modifiers that you can attach to fields, arguments, or even the entire schema to alter their behavior.

For example, the built-in `@include` and `@skip` directives allow you to conditionally include or exclude parts of your query based on arguments. Custom directives offer a similar mechanism but with the flexibility to define your own logic.

## Why Use Custom Directives in Gatsby?

Custom directives provide several benefits within a Gatsby context:

- **Code Reusability:** Encapsulate common data transformations or filtering logic into reusable directives.
- **Improved Readability:** Clean up your GraphQL queries by moving complex logic into directives.
- **Schema Enrichment:** Add metadata to your schema that can be used by other tools or libraries.
- **Custom Authentication/Authorization:** Implement fine-grained access control at the GraphQL level.
- **Data Validation:** Validate data against specific criteria before it's returned in your queries.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Custom Directive in Gatsby

Let's walk through the process of creating a custom directive in a Gatsby project. We'll build a directive called `@upperCase` that automatically transforms a string field to uppercase.

**1. Project Setup (if you don't have a Gatsby project already):**

```plaintext
gatsby new my-gatsby-site
cd my-gatsby-site
```

**2. Create a Plugin (Recommended):**

For better organization and reusability, it's best to encapsulate your directive logic within a Gatsby plugin. Create a directory `plugins/gatsby-source-custom` (or any name you prefer) and then create a file `plugins/gatsby-source-custom/gatsby-node.js`. This ensures your directive is applied before your component code runs.

**3. Implement `onCreateWebpackConfig` in `gatsby-node.js`:**

Inside `plugins/gatsby-source-custom/gatsby-node.js`, we need to tell Webpack to load the necessary files to handle our directive.

```plaintext
// plugins/gatsby-source-custom/gatsby-node.js

exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions, loaders, getConfig }) => {
  const config = getConfig()
  if (config.mode === 'production') {
    config.devtool = false
  }

  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.js$/,
          exclude: /(node_modules|cache|public)/,
          use: [loaders.js()],
        },
      ],
    },
  })
}
```

**4. Implement `createSchemaCustomization` in `gatsby-node.js`:**

This is the core of defining and implementing the directive. `createSchemaCustomization` allows you to modify Gatsby's GraphQL schema.

```plaintext
// plugins/gatsby-source-custom/gatsby-node.js

const { GraphQLDirective, GraphQLString, DirectiveLocation } = require('graphql')

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions

  // Define the schema for the directive
  createFieldExtension({
    name: 'upperCase',
    extendField({ resolve }) {
      return {
        resolve: async (source, args, context, info) => {
          const value = await resolve(source, args, context, info)
          if (typeof value === 'string') {
            return value.toUpperCase()
          }
          return value // Return original value if not a string
        },
      }
    },
  })

  // This is necessary to define the directive and make it available in GraphQL queries
  createTypes(`
    directive @upperCase on FIELD_DEFINITION
  `)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`createFieldExtension`:** This function registers our directive named `upperCase`.
  - `name: 'upperCase'`: Specifies the name of the directive.
  - `extendField({ resolve })`: Provides access to the original resolver of the field. We use the `resolve` function from the existing field to get the original value.
  - Inside the `resolve` function:
    - We call the original resolver to get the field's value.
    - If the value is a string, we transform it to uppercase.
    - If the value is not a string, we return the original value without modification. This is important to prevent errors on non-string fields.
- **`createTypes`:** This function defines the directive in the GraphQL schema. This is crucial for Gatsby to recognize the directive and allow you to use it in your queries. Without this, you'll get schema validation errors.
  - `directive @upperCase on FIELD_DEFINITION`: This tells GraphQL that we have a directive named `@upperCase` and that it can be applied to `FIELD_DEFINITION` (i.e., fields in our GraphQL schema).

**5. Add the Plugin to `gatsby-config.js`:**

Enable your new plugin by adding it to the `plugins` array in your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-source-filesystem', // Add this plugin to test with markdown files.
    {
      resolve: 'plugins/gatsby-source-custom',
      options: {
        // You can add options here if needed for your plugin.
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**6. Create a Markdown File for Testing (optional but recommended):**

To test our directive, let's create a simple Markdown file:

```markdown
---
title: 'My Awesome Post'
---

Hello, world!
```

Save this as `content/blog/my-post.md`. Make sure you have the `gatsby-source-filesystem` plugin configured to read from your content directory.

To ensure the file is processed correctly, add the following to `gatsby-config.js`:

```plaintext
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `blog`,
        path: `${__dirname}/content/blog`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-remark`, // To process markdown files
    {
      resolve: 'plugins/gatsby-source-custom',
      options: {
        // You can add options here if needed for your plugin.
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**7. Query the Data with the `@upperCase` Directive:**

Now, you can use the `@upperCase` directive in your GraphQL queries. In a page component (e.g., `src/pages/index.js` or a blog post template), use the following query:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    markdownRemark(frontmatter: { title: { eq: "My Awesome Post" } }) {
      frontmatter {
        title @upperCase
      }
    }
  }
`

const IndexPage = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{data.markdownRemark.frontmatter.title}</h1>
  </div>
)

export default IndexPage
```

**8. Run `gatsby develop` and View the Results:**

Start the Gatsby development server:

```plaintext
gatsby develop
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` (or your Gatsby development URL). You should see "MY AWESOME POST" displayed on the page. The `@upperCase` directive transformed the title from "My Awesome Post" to uppercase.

## Expanding the Directive: Adding Arguments

Let's enhance our directive to accept an argument for customizing the case transformation. We'll modify it to accept a `type` argument with values "upper" (default) or "lower".

**1. Modify `gatsby-node.js`:**

```plaintext
// plugins/gatsby-source-custom/gatsby-node.js

const { GraphQLDirective, GraphQLString, GraphQLEnumType, DirectiveLocation } = require('graphql')

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions

  const CaseTypeEnum = new GraphQLEnumType({
    name: 'CaseType',
    values: {
      UPPER: { value: 'upper' },
      LOWER: { value: 'lower' },
    },
  })

  createFieldExtension({
    name: 'customCase',
    args: {
      type: {
        type: CaseTypeEnum,
        defaultValue: 'upper',
      },
    },
    extendField({ resolve, args }) {
      return {
        resolve: async (source, args, context, info) => {
          const value = await resolve(source, args, context, info)
          if (typeof value === 'string') {
            if (args.type === 'upper') {
              return value.toUpperCase()
            } else if (args.type === 'lower') {
              return value.toLowerCase()
            }
          }
          return value
        },
      }
    },
  })

  // This is necessary to define the directive and make it available in GraphQL queries
  createTypes(`
    directive @customCase(type: CaseType = UPPER) on FIELD_DEFINITION

    enum CaseType {
      UPPER
      LOWER
    }
  `)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`GraphQLEnumType`:** We define a GraphQL enum type called `CaseType` with values "UPPER" and "LOWER". This enforces that the `type` argument can only have these two values.
- **`args` in `createFieldExtension`:** We define the `args` object for our directive.
  - `type`: This is the name of the argument.
  - `type: CaseTypeEnum`: Specifies the type of the argument (our newly created enum).
  - `defaultValue: 'upper'`: Sets the default value of the argument to "upper" if it's not explicitly provided in the query.
- **Accessing `args` in `extendField`:** The `extendField` function now receives an `args` object containing the values passed to the directive in the query. We access the `type` argument using `args.type`.
- **Conditional Transformation:** We use an `if` statement to conditionally transform the string based on the value of `args.type`.
- **Schema Definition Update:** We updated the `createTypes` to define the `@customCase` directive with the `type` argument and its associated `CaseType` enum. Note how we're also setting the default value to `UPPER` in the schema definition: `directive @customCase(type: CaseType = UPPER) on FIELD_DEFINITION`

**2. Update Your Query:**

Now you can use the `@customCase` directive with the `type` argument in your GraphQL query:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    markdownRemark(frontmatter: { title: { eq: "My Awesome Post" } }) {
      frontmatter {
        title @customCase(type: LOWER)
      }
    }
  }
`

const IndexPage = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{data.markdownRemark.frontmatter.title}</h1>
  </div>
)

export default IndexPage
```

In this example, we're using `@customCase(type: LOWER)` to transform the title to lowercase.

**3. Verify the Results:**

After running `gatsby develop`, you should now see "my awesome post" displayed on the page. The `title` is now lowercase.

## Best Practices for Custom Directives

- **Keep it Focused:** Directives should ideally handle a single, specific task (e.g., formatting, validation, authorization).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within your directive resolvers. Return meaningful error messages to the client.
- **Consider Performance:** Be mindful of the performance impact of your directives, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document your custom directives and their intended usage.
- **Avoid Overuse:** Don't overuse directives. Sometimes, a custom resolver or a transformation within your component might be more appropriate.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your directives with various input values to ensure they function correctly.
- **Plugin First:** Always encapsulate directive logic within a Gatsby plugin for organization.
