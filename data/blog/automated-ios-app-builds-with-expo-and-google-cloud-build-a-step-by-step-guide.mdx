# Automated iOS App Builds with Expo and Google Cloud Build: A Step-by-Step Guide

Deploying iOS apps can be a time-consuming process, especially when done manually.  This guide demonstrates how to automate your iOS app builds using Expo and Google Cloud Build, streamlining your workflow, reducing errors, and ensuring faster releases.  We'll walk through the entire process, from setting up your Expo project to configuring Google Cloud Build to trigger builds automatically. This will give you a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for your iOS Expo app.

## Why Automate iOS Builds with Expo and Google Cloud Build?

*   **Speed and Efficiency:** Automate the entire build, test, and deployment process.
*   **Reduced Errors:** Eliminate manual steps that are prone to human error.
*   **Consistent Builds:** Ensure that builds are always consistent and reproducible.
*   **Faster Releases:**  Accelerate the release cycle and get updates to users quicker.
*   **Team Collaboration:**  Enable developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with build complexities.
*   **Scalability:** Cloud Build provides the infrastructure to scale your build process as your app grows.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Expo Account:**  Sign up for a free Expo account at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/).
*   **Google Cloud Account:**  Create a Google Cloud account at [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/).  You may need to enable billing.
*   **Expo Project:** You have an existing Expo project or create a new one using `expo init`.
*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Installed on your local machine.
*   **Firebase CLI (Optional):** Needed if you use Firebase. Install via `npm install -g firebase-tools`.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Expo Project for Cloud Build

### 1.  Install Expo CLI Globally (If not already installed):

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

or

```bash
yarn global add expo-cli
```

### 2.  Configure `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) for iOS

Your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file contains crucial configuration settings for your Expo app.  Ensure the following key settings are properly configured for iOS builds:

*   **`name`:** The name of your app.
*   **`slug`:** A URL-friendly version of your app name.  This is used in the Expo Go app.
*   **`version`:**  The version number of your app.
*   **`ios.bundleIdentifier`:**  The unique identifier for your iOS app (e.g., `com.example.myapp`).  This is essential and *must* be unique on the App Store.  Make sure this identifier is properly configured in your Apple Developer account if you plan to submit the app.
*   **`ios.buildNumber`:**  An incremental build number for your iOS app.  This must be incremented for *every* build you want to submit to TestFlight or the App Store.
*   **`ios.supportsTablet`:** Whether your app supports tablet devices.
*   **`ios.infoPlist`:** (Optional) Allows specifying custom entries in the `Info.plist` file.  Useful for configuring settings like camera usage description, etc.  Example:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "slug": "myapp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "updates": {
      "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": [
      "**/*"
    ],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp",
      "buildNumber": "1.0.0",
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSCameraUsageDescription": "This app needs camera access to scan QR codes."
      }
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF"
      }
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    }
  }
}
```

**Incrementing the Build Number:**

The `ios.buildNumber` *must* be incremented with each build. Consider using a script or CI/CD system to automatically increment this value.  A simple example (using `jq` on Linux/macOS):

```bash
# Increment build number using jq
BUILD_NUMBER=$(jq '.expo.ios.buildNumber | tonumber' app.json)
NEW_BUILD_NUMBER=$((BUILD_NUMBER + 1))
jq ".expo.ios.buildNumber = \"$NEW_BUILD_NUMBER\"" app.json > temp.json && mv temp.json app.json

echo "Incremented build number to: $NEW_BUILD_NUMBER"
```

**Note:** `jq` is a command-line JSON processor. You may need to install it (e.g., `brew install jq` on macOS).  Adapt this script for your specific build environment.

### 3.  Create an Expo Account and Login in Your Project

Make sure you have an Expo account and that your project is linked to your account. Login via:

```bash
expo login
```

### 4.  Generate an iOS Distribution Certificate and Provisioning Profile

This is arguably the most complex part.  You *must* have valid distribution certificates and provisioning profiles to build and sign your iOS app for submission to the App Store.

There are two main approaches:

*   **Using Expo Application Services (EAS):** This is the *recommended* and simplest method. EAS Build handles the complexities of certificate management for you.  See the Expo documentation for EAS Build: [https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/)

    *   Initialize EAS:

        ```bash
        eas init
        ```

    *   Configure EAS Build in `eas.json`.  Example configuration:

        ```json
        {
          "build": {
            "development": {
              "developmentClient": true,
              "distribution": "internal"
            },
            "preview": {
              "distribution": "expo-go"
            },
            "production": {
              "distribution": "app-store",
              "ios": {
                "simulator": false
              }
            }
          },
          "submit": {
            "production": {}
          }
        }
        ```

    *   Build with EAS:

        ```bash
        eas build -p ios --profile production
        ```

    *   EAS will guide you through creating or selecting existing certificates and provisioning profiles.

*   **Manual Certificate and Profile Management (Advanced):**  This involves manually creating your distribution certificate and provisioning profile in your Apple Developer account. This is more complex and error-prone but gives you finer-grained control.  Refer to Apple's documentation on code signing for iOS.  *If you go this route, you'll need to securely store and manage your certificate and provisioning profile and provide them to Cloud Build (explained later).*  We highly recommend using EAS Build unless you have very specific requirements.

### 5.  Commit Your Changes

Commit your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) and any other relevant changes to your Git repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure Expo project for iOS builds"
git push origin main  # Or your branch name
```

## Step 2: Setting Up Google Cloud Build

### 1.  Enable the Cloud Build API

In your Google Cloud project, navigate to the Cloud Build API and enable it.

### 2.  Create a Service Account

Create a dedicated service account for Cloud Build.  This service account will need specific permissions to access resources in your Google Cloud project.

*   Go to **IAM & Admin > Service accounts** in the Google Cloud Console.
*   Click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
*   Give the service account a name (e.g., `cloud-build-expo`).
*   Grant the service account the following roles (at minimum):
    *   **Cloud Build Service Account**
    *   **Storage Object Viewer** (if you're storing build artifacts in Cloud Storage)
    *   **Storage Object Creator** (if you're storing build artifacts in Cloud Storage)
    *   **Firebase Admin (Full Access)** (If you're using Firebase for hosting or other services)
    *   **IAM > Service Account User** (needed if Cloud Build needs to impersonate another service account)
*   Click **DONE**.

### 3.  Create a `cloudbuild.yaml` File

This file defines the steps Cloud Build will execute.  Create a `cloudbuild.yaml` file in the root of your Expo project.  This is the *core* of your Cloud Build configuration.

```yaml
steps:
  # Install Node.js and npm
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        nvm install 16
        nvm use 16
        npm install -g npm@latest

  # Install Expo CLI
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install', '-g', 'expo-cli']

  # Install dependencies
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install']

  # Configure Expo (replace with your actual account and --non-interactive flag is important)
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: expo
    args: ['login', '-u', '${_EXPO_USERNAME}', '-p', '${_EXPO_PASSWORD}', '--non-interactive']

  # EAS Build - Replace with your specific profile.  Ensure EAS CLI is installed
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        npm install -g eas-cli
        eas build -p ios --profile production --non-interactive

  # Upload artifacts to Cloud Storage (Optional, but recommended)
  - name: google/cloud-sdk
    entrypoint: gsutil
    args: ['cp', '-r', './dist/*', 'gs://${PROJECT_ID}-expo-builds/ios/']

options:
  substitutionMappings:
    _EXPO_USERNAME: 'your_expo_username'  # Replace with your Expo username
    _EXPO_PASSWORD: 'your_expo_password'  # Replace with your Expo password
```

**Explanation of the `cloudbuild.yaml` File:**

*   **`steps`**:  An array of steps that Cloud Build will execute in sequence.
*   **`name`**: The Docker image to use for this step.  We're using `node:16` for most steps, indicating a Node.js environment.  `google/cloud-sdk` is used for Cloud Storage operations.
*   **`entrypoint`**: The command to execute within the Docker image.  We're using `npm`, `expo`, `eas`, and `gsutil` (Cloud Storage utility).
*   **`args`**:  An array of arguments to pass to the `entrypoint`.
*   **`substitutionMappings`**:  Allows you to define variables that can be substituted in your `cloudbuild.yaml` file.  This is crucial for storing sensitive information like your Expo credentials *securely* (see below).
*   **`_EXPO_USERNAME` and `_EXPO_PASSWORD`**: These are placeholder variables for your Expo username and password.  **Do not hardcode your credentials directly in the `cloudbuild.yaml` file.**  We'll configure these securely in Cloud Build later.
*   **`gs://${PROJECT_ID}-expo-builds/ios/`**: Replace `${PROJECT_ID}-expo-builds` with the name of your Cloud Storage bucket where you want to store the build artifacts (e.g., IPA file). Create this bucket *before* running the build. Make sure the service account has access.
*   **`eas build -p ios --profile production --non-interactive`**:  This command initiates an EAS Build for iOS using the 'production' profile defined in your `eas.json` file. The `--non-interactive` flag is *essential* for automated builds.

**Important Security Considerations for Credentials:**

*   **Do NOT hardcode your Expo username and password in the `cloudbuild.yaml` file!**
*   **Use Cloud Build substitution variables and Secrets:**
    *   In the Cloud Build configuration, use substitution variables (e.g., `${_EXPO_USERNAME}`, `${_EXPO_PASSWORD}`).
    *   Store your Expo username and password as *secrets* in Google Cloud Secret Manager.
    *   Grant the Cloud Build service account permission to access those secrets.  This is the most secure way to handle credentials.

**Alternative - Using Environment Variables (Less Secure, but simpler for testing):**

*   Instead of secrets, you can store your credentials as environment variables in the Cloud Build trigger.
*   However, this is less secure than using Secret Manager.

### 4.  Create a Cloud Storage Bucket (Optional but Recommended)

If you want to store the build artifacts (IPA file) in Cloud Storage, create a bucket in your Google Cloud project.

*   Go to **Cloud Storage** in the Google Cloud Console.
*   Click **+ CREATE BUCKET**.
*   Give the bucket a name (e.g., `your-project-id-expo-builds`).
*   Choose a region close to you.
*   Click **CREATE**.

Ensure the Cloud Build service account has permission to write to this bucket.

### 5.  Create a Cloud Build Trigger

A Cloud Build trigger automatically initiates a build based on a specific event, such as a push to a Git repository.

*   Go to **Cloud Build > Triggers** in the Google Cloud Console.
*   Click **+ CREATE TRIGGER**.
*   **Name:** Give the trigger a descriptive name (e.g., `ios-expo-build`).
*   **Region:** Choose a region.
*   **Event:** Select the event that will trigger the build (e.g., "Push to a branch").
*   **Repository:** Select your Git repository.
*   **Branch:**  Specify the branch to monitor (e.g., `main`).
*   **Configuration:** Select "Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json)".
*   **Location:** Specify the location of your `cloudbuild.yaml` file (e.g., `/cloudbuild.yaml`).
*   **Substitutions Variables:** Here, you will add your secure variables. If you set up your variables as secrets in Google Cloud Secret Manager, create variables like `_EXPO_USERNAME` and link them to the secret.  If you are using environment variables, define them here.
*   Click **CREATE**.

## Step 3: Running Your Cloud Build

### 1.  Trigger the Build

Depending on the trigger you configured, a build will be automatically triggered when the specified event occurs (e.g., a push to the `main` branch).

### 2.  Monitor the Build

Go to **Cloud Build > History** in the Google Cloud Console to monitor the progress of your build.  You can view the logs to see the output of each step.

### 3.  Troubleshooting

If the build fails, examine the logs carefully to identify the cause of the error. Common issues include:

*   **Incorrect Expo credentials:** Double-check your username and password.
*   **Missing dependencies:** Ensure all required dependencies are installed in your `package.json` file.
*   **Incorrect `app.json` configuration:** Verify that your `app.json` file is correctly configured for iOS builds, especially the `bundleIdentifier` and `buildNumber`.
*   **Certificate and provisioning profile issues:**  Make sure your distribution certificate and provisioning profile are valid and properly configured, particularly if you are not using EAS Build. EAS Build greatly simplifies this process.
*   **Cloud Build Service Account Permissions:**  Verify that the Cloud Build service account has the necessary permissions to access resources in your Google Cloud project.
*   **Expo Build errors:** Carefully read the output from EAS Build to diagnose specific build problems within Expo.  This might include errors in your React Native code, asset loading issues, or plugin compatibility problems.

## Step 4: Distributing Your App

Once your build is successful, you'll have an IPA file. You can then distribute your app using the following methods:

*   **TestFlight:** Upload the IPA file to TestFlight for beta testing by internal testers and external users before App Store release.
*   **App Store:** Submit the IPA file to the App Store for review and publication.

## Example: Incrementing the iOS Build Number Automatically

To ensure that your `ios.buildNumber` is automatically incremented with each build, incorporate a script into your `cloudbuild.yaml` file:

```yaml
steps:
  # Install Node.js and npm (as before)
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        nvm install 16
        nvm use 16
        npm install -g npm@latest

  # Install jq (required for JSON manipulation)
  - name: 'appropriate/curl'  # Docker image containing curl
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        apt-get update
        apt-get install -y jq

  # Increment the iOS build number
  - name: 'node:16'
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        BUILD_NUMBER=$(jq '.expo.ios.buildNumber | tonumber' app.json)
        NEW_BUILD_NUMBER=$((BUILD_NUMBER + 1))
        jq ".expo.ios.buildNumber = \"$NEW_BUILD_NUMBER\"" app.json > temp.json && mv temp.json app.json
        echo "Incremented build number to: $NEW_BUILD_NUMBER"

  # Install Expo CLI (as before)
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install', '-g', 'expo-cli']

  # Install dependencies (as before)
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install']

  # Configure Expo (as before)
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: expo
    args: ['login', '-u', '${_EXPO_USERNAME}', '-p', '${_EXPO_PASSWORD}', '--non-interactive']

  # EAS Build (as before)
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        npm install -g eas-cli
        eas build -p ios --profile production --non-interactive

  # Upload artifacts to Cloud Storage (Optional, but recommended)
  - name: google/cloud-sdk
    entrypoint: gsutil
    args: ['cp', '-r', './dist/*', 'gs://${PROJECT_ID}-expo-builds/ios/']

options:
  substitutionMappings:
    _EXPO_USERNAME: 'your_expo_username'  # Replace with your Expo username
    _EXPO_PASSWORD: 'your_expo_password'  # Replace with your Expo password
```

**Explanation of the Increment Build Number Step:**

1.  **Install `jq`**: Uses the `appropriate/curl` Docker image to run `apt-get update` and `apt-get install -y jq` to install `jq`.  If `jq` is already available in another Docker image you are using, you don't need this step.
2.  **Increment the `ios.buildNumber`**:
    *   `BUILD_NUMBER=$(jq '.expo.ios.buildNumber | tonumber' app.json)`: Reads the current build number from `app.json` using `jq`.
    *   `NEW_BUILD_NUMBER=$((BUILD_NUMBER + 1))`: Increments the build number.
    *   `jq ".expo.ios.buildNumber = \"$NEW_BUILD_NUMBER\"" app.json > temp.json && mv temp.json app.json`: Updates the `app.json` file with the new build number using `jq`.  The `temp.json` file is a temporary file used for atomic replacement.
    *   `echo "Incremented build number to: $NEW_BUILD_NUMBER"`: Prints the new build number to the Cloud Build logs.

This ensures that your `ios.buildNumber` is automatically incremented with each build, which is essential for TestFlight and App Store submissions.

## Conclusion

Automating your iOS app builds with Expo and Google Cloud Build can significantly improve your mobile development workflow. By following this guide, you can set up a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire build, test, and deployment process, allowing you to focus on building great apps and delivering them to users faster.  Remember to prioritize security by using Secret Manager to store your sensitive credentials.  Good luck and happy building!
