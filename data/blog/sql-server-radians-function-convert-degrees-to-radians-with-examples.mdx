# SQL Server RADIANS() Function: A Comprehensive Guide

The `RADIANS()` function in SQL Server is a built-in mathematical function that converts an angle measured in degrees to its equivalent in radians. This is crucial for performing trigonometric calculations within your SQL Server database, as many trigonometric functions like `SIN()`, `COS()`, and `TAN()` expect their input in radians.

## Understanding Radians

Before diving into the function itself, it's important to understand what radians are. Radians are a unit of angular measurement, defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. One complete revolution (360 degrees) is equal to 2π radians.

The formula for converting degrees to radians is:

```
radians = degrees * (π / 180)
```

Thankfully, SQL Server's `RADIANS()` function handles this conversion for you, simplifying your trigonometric calculations.

## Syntax

The syntax for the `RADIANS()` function is straightforward:

```plaintext
RADIANS ( numeric_expression )
```

- **numeric_expression:** This is the angle in degrees that you want to convert to radians. It can be an integer, decimal, float, or any data type that can be implicitly converted to a numeric value.

## Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of using the `RADIANS()` function:

**1. Converting a Single Degree Value:**

```plaintext
SELECT RADIANS(45);
-- Output: 0.7853981633974483
```

This query converts 45 degrees to radians, resulting in approximately 0.785 radians (π/4).

**2. Converting Multiple Degree Values:**

```plaintext
SELECT
    RADIANS(0) AS ZeroDegrees,
    RADIANS(90) AS NinetyDegrees,
    RADIANS(180) AS OneEightyDegrees,
    RADIANS(270) AS TwoSeventyDegrees,
    RADIANS(360) AS ThreeSixtyDegrees;

-- Output:
-- ZeroDegrees: 0.0000000000000000
-- NinetyDegrees: 1.5707963267948966
-- OneEightyDegrees: 3.1415926535897931
-- TwoSeventyDegrees: 4.7123889803846901
-- ThreeSixtyDegrees: 6.2831853071795862
```

This example demonstrates the conversion of common angle values to radians. Notice how 180 degrees equals approximately π (3.14159) radians and 360 degrees equals approximately 2π (6.28318) radians.

**3. Using RADIANS() with other trigonometric functions:**

Let's calculate the sine of 45 degrees using the `SIN()` function, remembering that `SIN()` expects its input in radians:

```plaintext
SELECT SIN(RADIANS(45));
-- Output: 0.7071067811865475
```

This query first converts 45 degrees to radians using `RADIANS()` and then calculates the sine of the resulting radian value. The result is approximately 0.707, which is the sine of 45 degrees (or π/4 radians).

**4. Using RADIANS() with a column in a table:**

Suppose you have a table called `Angles` with a column named `DegreeValue` containing angle values in degrees. You can use `RADIANS()` to convert these values to radians:

```plaintext
CREATE TABLE Angles (
    AngleID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    DegreeValue DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO Angles (DegreeValue) VALUES (30), (60), (90), (120);

SELECT
    AngleID,
    DegreeValue,
    RADIANS(DegreeValue) AS RadianValue
FROM
    Angles;

-- Output (example):
-- AngleID | DegreeValue | RadianValue
-- ------- | ----------- | -------------
-- 1       | 30.00       | 0.5235987755982988
-- 2       | 60.00       | 1.0471975511965976
-- 3       | 90.00       | 1.5707963267948966
-- 4       | 120.00      | 2.0943951023931953
```

This example demonstrates how to apply the `RADIANS()` function to a column of degree values within a table, making it easy to work with trigonometric calculations in your data.

**5. Using RADIANS() in a more complex calculation (calculating the circumference of a circle sector):**

Let's say you want to calculate the arc length (circumference of a sector) of a circle with radius 5 and a central angle of 60 degrees. The formula for arc length is:

```
arc length = radius * angle (in radians)
```

Here's how you'd do it in SQL Server:

```plaintext
DECLARE @radius DECIMAL(10,2) = 5;
DECLARE @angleDegrees DECIMAL(10,2) = 60;

SELECT @radius * RADIANS(@angleDegrees) AS ArcLength;

-- Output: 5.2359877559829880
```

This query calculates the arc length to be approximately 5.236.

## Important Considerations

- **Data Types:** Ensure that the `numeric_expression` you pass to `RADIANS()` is of a suitable numeric data type. Implicit conversions may occur, but it's best to be explicit to avoid unexpected results.
- **Precision:** The `RADIANS()` function returns a value with a certain level of precision. If you require higher precision for your calculations, consider using appropriate data types like `DECIMAL` with sufficient scale and precision.
- **Error Handling:** The `RADIANS()` function will not throw an error if the input is a valid numeric type, even if the value is extremely large or small. It's your responsibility to ensure the input values are meaningful within the context of your application.

## Conclusion

The `RADIANS()` function is a valuable tool for performing trigonometric calculations in SQL Server. By understanding its syntax and usage, you can easily convert angles from degrees to radians and integrate trigonometric functions into your database queries and stored procedures. This allows you to perform more complex data analysis and calculations that require angular measurements, opening up possibilities for scientific, engineering, and other applications within your database environment. Remember to always double-check your results and understand the implications of using radians in your specific context.
