# The St. Petersburg Paradox: A Deep Dive into Probability and Expected Value

The St. Petersburg Paradox is a famous problem in probability theory and decision theory. It highlights a discrepancy between what classical expected value calculations suggest and what people are actually willing to risk in a gamble. Essentially, it's a game with an infinite expected value, yet rational people are usually only willing to pay a small amount to participate. This leads to fascinating discussions about risk aversion, diminishing marginal utility, and the limitations of expected value as a sole guide for decision-making.

## The Game: How the St. Petersburg Paradox Works

Imagine a game where you flip a fair coin repeatedly. The game continues until the coin lands on tails. The payout depends on the number of flips required to get the first tails:

- If tails comes up on the first flip (HT), you win \$2<sup>1</sup> = \$2.
- If tails comes up on the second flip (HHT), you win \$2<sup>2</sup> = \$4.
- If tails comes up on the third flip (HHHT), you win \$2<sup>3</sup> = \$8.
- If tails comes up on the *n*th flip (H...HT), you win \$2<sup>n</sup> dollars.

In short, the payout doubles with each consecutive heads flipped before the first tails.

## Calculating the Expected Value: Why It's Infinite

The expected value (EV) of a game represents the average payout you would expect to receive if you played the game many times. It's calculated by summing the product of each possible outcome and its probability:

EV = (Probability of Outcome 1 \* Value of Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 \* Value of Outcome 2) + ...

Let's calculate the expected value for the St. Petersburg game:

- **Outcome 1 (T on first flip):** Probability = 1/2, Payout = \$2
- **Outcome 2 (HT):** Probability = 1/4, Payout = \$4
- **Outcome 3 (HHT):** Probability = 1/8, Payout = \$8
- **Outcome _n_ (H...HT):** Probability = 1/2<sup>n</sup>, Payout = \$2<sup>n</sup>

Therefore, the expected value is:

EV = (1/2 _ \$2) + (1/4 _ \$4) + (1/8 _ \$8) + (1/16 _ \$16) + ...
EV = \$1 + \$1 + \$1 + \$1 + ...

As you can see, the expected value is the sum of an infinite series of \$1, which results in an infinite expected value.

```plaintext
def st_petersburg_expected_value(n_terms=100):
  """
  Calculates the expected value of the St. Petersburg game for a given number of terms.

  Args:
    n_terms: The number of terms to include in the calculation.  Using a large number
             approximates the infinite series.

  Returns:
    The calculated expected value (float).
  """
  expected_value = 0
  for n in range(1, n_terms + 1):
    probability = 1 / (2**n)
    payout = 2**n
    expected_value += probability * payout
  return expected_value

# Calculate for 100 terms (approximation of infinity)
approximate_ev = st_petersburg_expected_value()
print(f"Approximate Expected Value (100 terms): ${approximate_ev}")

# Example showing how the expected value grows (slowly) with more terms
print(f"Expected Value (10 terms): ${st_petersburg_expected_value(10)}")
print(f"Expected Value (50 terms): ${st_petersburg_expected_value(50)}")
```

This Python code demonstrates how the expected value is calculated and shows that even with a large number of terms, the value increases relatively slowly, albeit infinitely.

## The Paradox: Why People Won't Pay Much to Play

The paradox arises because, despite the infinite expected value, most people are only willing to pay a relatively small amount to play this game. For instance, someone might be willing to pay \$5, \$10, or even \$20, but rarely will they risk hundreds or thousands of dollars for the chance to play, even though the expected return is mathematically infinite. Why is this the case?

Several factors contribute to this seemingly irrational behavior:

- **Risk Aversion:** Most people are risk-averse. We prefer a certain smaller gain over a gamble with a potentially very large gain but also a significant chance of a smaller or zero gain. The potential downside (losing the entry fee) weighs more heavily than the potential upside.

- **Diminishing Marginal Utility of Money:** The value (or utility) of each additional dollar decreases as you accumulate more money. Winning \$2 has a significant impact when you have very little money, but winning \$2<sup>20</sup> (over a million dollars) doesn't have as much relative impact when you already have a substantial amount of wealth. Essentially, the potential high payouts have diminishing returns on happiness and well-being.

- **Uncertainty about the Gambler's Ability to Pay:** In the theoretical setup, the gambler promises to pay potentially infinite amounts. In the real world, there's always a chance the gambler might not be able to pay the promised sum, especially for the extremely rare, but theoretically possible, outcomes with huge payouts. This uncertainty reduces the perceived value of the gamble.

- **Practical Limitations:** The game assumes an infinite number of coin flips, which is impossible in reality. Even if the game were played a large number of times, the highest payouts are so rare that you'd likely never experience them. This significantly diminishes the practical expected value over a reasonable number of plays.

## Proposed Solutions and Explanations

Several attempts have been made to resolve the St. Petersburg Paradox, offering alternative models that better reflect real-world decision-making:

- **Utility Theory:** This approach replaces the monetary payoff with a utility function that reflects the diminishing marginal utility of money. Instead of directly using the monetary value, the expected value is calculated using the utility derived from each payout. For example, a logarithmic utility function, `U(x) = log(x)`, is often used.

- **Probability Weighting:** This theory suggests that people don't perceive probabilities linearly. They tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities. This distorted perception of probabilities can significantly affect the perceived expected value.

- **Finite Wealth Constraint:** This solution acknowledges that no one has infinite resources. Imposing a limit on the maximum payout immediately makes the expected value finite. Even a very large limit significantly reduces the willingness to pay.

## Code Example: Utility Theory Approach

Let's modify the previous Python code to incorporate a logarithmic utility function:

```plaintext
import math

def st_petersburg_utility_expected_value(n_terms=100, utility_function=math.log):
  """
  Calculates the expected utility value of the St. Petersburg game using a logarithmic utility function.

  Args:
    n_terms: The number of terms to include in the calculation.
    utility_function: The utility function to use (default: natural logarithm).

  Returns:
    The calculated expected utility value (float).
  """
  expected_utility = 0
  for n in range(1, n_terms + 1):
    probability = 1 / (2**n)
    payout = 2**n
    utility = utility_function(payout) # Calculate the utility of the payout
    expected_utility += probability * utility
  return expected_utility

# Calculate with logarithmic utility
expected_utility = st_petersburg_utility_expected_value()
print(f"Expected Utility (Logarithmic, 100 terms): {expected_utility}")

# Example using a square root utility function (another common choice)
def square_root_utility(x):
    return math.sqrt(x)

expected_utility_sqrt = st_petersburg_utility_expected_value(utility_function=square_root_utility)
print(f"Expected Utility (Square Root, 100 terms): {expected_utility_sqrt}")
```

This code demonstrates how using a utility function, instead of directly using the monetary value, can significantly reduce the expected value, making it more aligned with what people are willing to pay. Different utility functions will produce different expected utility values, reflecting varying degrees of risk aversion.

## Conclusion

The St. Petersburg Paradox is more than just a mathematical curiosity; it's a powerful illustration of the limitations of expected value as a sole guide for decision-making. It highlights the importance of considering factors such as risk aversion, diminishing marginal utility, and real-world constraints when evaluating gambles and making choices under uncertainty. This paradox continues to be a valuable case study in fields like economics, finance, and psychology, shaping our understanding of how people make decisions when faced with risk and uncertainty. By exploring the paradox and its proposed solutions, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human behavior and the nuances of probability theory.
