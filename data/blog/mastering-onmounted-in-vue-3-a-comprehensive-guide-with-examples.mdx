# Mastering `onMounted` in Vue 3: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The `onMounted` lifecycle hook in Vue 3 is a crucial tool for developers. It allows you to execute code **after** your component has been fully mounted to the DOM. This provides a perfect opportunity to initialize data, interact with the DOM, fetch external data, or integrate with third-party libraries that require the component to be present in the DOM. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to effectively use `onMounted` in Vue 3, complete with practical examples and best practices.

## What is `onMounted` in Vue 3?

In Vue 3, lifecycle hooks like `onMounted` are functions that are called at specific stages of a component's lifecycle. `onMounted` is triggered _after_ the component's initial render and the corresponding DOM node has been inserted into the document. It's the go-to hook for tasks that depend on the component existing in the DOM.

**Key characteristics of `onMounted`:**

- **Runs once per component instance:** `onMounted` is only executed once when the component is first mounted.
- **Access to the DOM:** You can reliably access and manipulate the component's DOM elements within `onMounted`.
- **Ideal for initialization:** Perfect for initializing data, setting up event listeners, and interacting with external libraries that require DOM access.

## How to Use `onMounted` in Vue 3

There are two primary ways to use `onMounted` in Vue 3, depending on whether you're using the Options API or the Composition API.

### 1. Using `onMounted` with the Composition API

The Composition API is the recommended approach for building Vue 3 applications. To use `onMounted` within a component utilizing the Composition API, you need to import it from the `vue` module and then call it within the `setup()` function.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p ref="myParagraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const myParagraph = ref(null)

    onMounted(() => {
      console.log('Component mounted!')
      // Access the paragraph element via the ref
      if (myParagraph.value) {
        console.log('Paragraph text:', myParagraph.value.textContent)
      }
    })

    return {
      myParagraph,
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';`**: This line imports the necessary `ref` and `onMounted` functions from the `vue` module.
- **`const myParagraph = ref(null);`**: This creates a reactive `ref` named `myParagraph`. It's initialized to `null` because the element doesn't exist yet when the component is first created. The `ref` is used to access the DOM element.
- **`onMounted(() => { ... });`**: This is where the `onMounted` hook is used. The function passed to `onMounted` will be executed after the component is mounted.
- **`myParagraph.value`**: Within `onMounted`, we can access the DOM element associated with the `myParagraph` ref using `myParagraph.value`. We check if it exists (`if (myParagraph.value)`) to avoid errors if the DOM element isn't available.
- **`return { myParagraph };`**: We expose the `myParagraph` ref so that it can be used in the template.

### 2. Using `onMounted` with the Options API (Less Common in Modern Vue 3 Development)

While the Composition API is favored in Vue 3, you can still use the Options API. In the Options API, `onMounted` is implemented as a method directly within the component's options object.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p ref="myParagraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  mounted() {
    console.log('Component mounted!')
    // Access the paragraph element via the ref
    if (this.$refs.myParagraph) {
      console.log('Paragraph text:', this.$refs.myParagraph.textContent)
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`mounted() { ... }`**: In the Options API, `mounted` is a standard lifecycle hook that functions identically to `onMounted` in the Composition API.
- **`this.$refs.myParagraph`**: Within the `mounted` hook, you access the DOM element via `this.$refs`. `this.$refs` is an object that contains references to all elements marked with the `ref` attribute in the template.

**Important Note:** While this method works, the Composition API offers better code organization and reusability, which is why it's the preferred approach for new Vue 3 projects.

## Practical Examples of Using `onMounted`

Here are some practical examples demonstrating how to leverage `onMounted` in various scenarios:

### Example 1: Fetching Data After Mounting

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Users</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">{{ user.name }}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const users = ref([])

    onMounted(async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
        const data = await response.json()
        users.value = data
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching users:', error)
      }
    })

    return {
      users,
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- This example demonstrates fetching data from an API (using `fetch`) _after_ the component has mounted.
- The `users` ref is initialized as an empty array.
- Inside the `onMounted` hook, an asynchronous function fetches data from the API and updates the `users` ref with the retrieved data.
- Error handling is included using a `try...catch` block.
- **Why use `onMounted` here?** Because the API request and subsequent UI update only make sense _after_ the component is ready to be displayed.

### Example 2: Interacting with Third-Party Libraries (e.g., Chart.js)

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <canvas ref="myChartCanvas"></canvas>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import Chart from 'chart.js/auto' // Import Chart.js

export default {
  setup() {
    const myChartCanvas = ref(null)
    let myChart = null // Store the chart instance

    onMounted(() => {
      const ctx = myChartCanvas.value.getContext('2d')

      myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'bar',
        data: {
          labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
          datasets: [
            {
              label: '# of Votes',
              data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
              borderWidth: 1,
            },
          ],
        },
        options: {
          scales: {
            y: {
              beginAtZero: true,
            },
          },
        },
      })
    })

    onUnmounted(() => {
      // Destroy the chart when the component is unmounted to prevent memory leaks
      if (myChart) {
        myChart.destroy()
      }
    })

    return {
      myChartCanvas,
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- This example demonstrates how to integrate with a third-party charting library like Chart.js.
- The component uses a `canvas` element to render the chart.
- In `onMounted`, the code gets the 2D rendering context from the canvas element and initializes a new Chart.js chart instance.
- **Why use `onMounted` here?** Because Chart.js needs the `canvas` element to exist in the DOM before it can be initialized.
- **Important:** The `onUnmounted` hook (included for completeness) demonstrates how to destroy the chart instance when the component is unmounted to prevent memory leaks. This is crucial for performance, especially with components that are frequently mounted and unmounted.

### Example 3: Direct DOM Manipulation

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p ref="message">Hello, Vue 3!</p>
    <button @click="updateMessage">Update Message</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const message = ref(null)

    onMounted(() => {
      // Change the text color of the paragraph when the component mounts
      if (message.value) {
        message.value.style.color = 'blue'
      }
    })

    const updateMessage = () => {
      if (message.value) {
        message.value.textContent = 'Message updated!'
      }
    }

    return {
      message,
      updateMessage,
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

- This example demonstrates direct manipulation of the DOM. While not always recommended (Vue's reactivity system is generally preferred), it can be useful in specific situations.
- The `onMounted` hook changes the text color of the paragraph to blue after the component mounts.
- **Why use `onMounted` here?** Because you need the DOM element to exist before you can directly manipulate its style.

## Best Practices for Using `onMounted`

- **Avoid long-running tasks:** Keep the code within `onMounted` relatively lightweight. For computationally intensive tasks, consider using `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame` to defer execution and avoid blocking the UI thread.

  ```plaintext
  onMounted(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Perform a computationally intensive task here
      console.log("Long running task completed");
    }, 0); // Defer execution to the next event loop
  });
  ```

- **Handle errors gracefully:** Wrap asynchronous operations (like API calls) in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors.

  ```plaintext
  onMounted(async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('your-api-endpoint');
      const data = await response.json();
      // Process the data
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      // Display an error message to the user
    }
  });
  ```

- **Clean up resources in `onUnmounted`:** If you set up event listeners or create external resources (like Chart.js instances) in `onMounted`, make sure to clean them up in the `onUnmounted` lifecycle hook to prevent memory leaks.

  ```vue
  <script>
  import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'

  export default {
    setup() {
      const myElement = ref(null)

      const handleClick = () => {
        console.log('Element clicked!')
      }

      onMounted(() => {
        if (myElement.value) {
          myElement.value.addEventListener('click', handleClick)
        }
      })

      onUnmounted(() => {
        if (myElement.value) {
          myElement.value.removeEventListener('click', handleClick)
        }
      })

      return {
        myElement,
      }
    },
  }
  </script>
  ```

- **Use `nextTick` if necessary:** If you need to access the DOM after a reactive update, use `nextTick` to ensure that the DOM has been updated before you attempt to access it. `nextTick` allows you to execute a callback _after_ the DOM has been updated by Vue.

  ```vue
  <template>
    <div>
      <p ref="message">{{ dynamicMessage }}</p>
      <button @click="updateMessage">Update Message</button>
    </div>
  </template>

  <script>
  import { ref, onMounted, nextTick } from 'vue'

  export default {
    setup() {
      const message = ref(null)
      const dynamicMessage = ref('Initial Message')

      onMounted(async () => {
        // Access the updated DOM after a reactive update
        dynamicMessage.value = 'Message after mount'
        await nextTick() // Wait for the DOM to update

        if (message.value) {
          console.log('Updated message text:', message.value.textContent)
        }
      })

      const updateMessage = () => {
        dynamicMessage.value = 'Message updated by button click'
      }

      return {
        message,
        dynamicMessage,
        updateMessage,
      }
    },
  }
  </script>
  ```
