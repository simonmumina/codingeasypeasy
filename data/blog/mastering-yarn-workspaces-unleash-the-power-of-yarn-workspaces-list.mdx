# Mastering Yarn Workspaces: Unleash the Power of `yarn workspaces list`

Yarn Workspaces have revolutionized the way we manage large JavaScript and TypeScript projects by enabling a monorepo structure. A monorepo is a single repository that houses multiple projects, offering benefits like code sharing, simplified dependency management, and atomic changes across the codebase. While Yarn provides a suite of tools for managing these workspaces, the `yarn workspaces list` command is a crucial asset for understanding and navigating your monorepo. This comprehensive guide will delve into the intricacies of `yarn workspaces list`, providing practical examples and best practices to help you master its usage.

## What are Yarn Workspaces?

Before diving into the specifics of `yarn workspaces list`, let's briefly recap what Yarn Workspaces are. Workspaces allow you to manage dependencies for multiple packages within a single top-level package.json file. This simplifies the development process, especially for large projects with many interdependent packages. Key benefits include:

- **Shared Dependencies:** Workspaces share common dependencies, reducing disk space and installation time.
- **Simplified Linking:** Yarn automatically links packages within the workspace, eliminating the need for `npm link` or `yarn link`.
- **Atomic Changes:** Changes across multiple packages can be made atomically, ensuring consistency.
- **Improved Code Sharing:** Sharing code and utilities between packages is significantly easier.

To enable workspaces, you need to add the `workspaces` field to your root `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*", "apps/*"],
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

In this example, `packages/*` and `apps/*` tell Yarn to treat any directories under the `packages` and `apps` directories as workspaces.

## Understanding `yarn workspaces list`

The `yarn workspaces list` command is your primary tool for gaining insights into your workspace setup. It provides a list of all workspaces defined in your project, along with their names and locations. This seemingly simple command unlocks a wealth of information that can significantly improve your development workflow.

### Basic Usage

The simplest form of the command is:

```plaintext
yarn workspaces list
```

This will output a list of all workspaces in your project, each on a new line, prefixed with the workspace name and location. For instance, if your monorepo structure looks like this:

```
my-monorepo/
├── package.json
├── packages/
│   ├── package-a/
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── package-b/
│       └── package.json
└── apps/
    └── webapp/
        └── package.json
```

And the `package.json` at the root contains the workspaces configuration as shown above, running `yarn workspaces list` might produce the following output:

```
package-a packages/package-a
package-b packages/package-b
webapp apps/webapp
```

### Flags and Options

`yarn workspaces list` offers several flags and options that allow you to customize the output and filter the results. These options give you more control over what information you see and how it's presented.

- **`-v` or `--verbose`:** Displays more detailed information about each workspace, including its dependencies, scripts, and more. This flag provides a comprehensive overview of each workspace's configuration.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces list -v
  ```

  The output will be significantly larger and include details from each workspace's `package.json` file. Be prepared for a long output if you have many workspaces.

- **`--json`:** Outputs the list of workspaces in JSON format. This is extremely useful for scripting and programmatically processing the workspace information. If you need to integrate the output of `yarn workspaces list` into other tools or scripts, this is the way to go.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces list --json
  ```

  The output will be a JSON array where each element represents a workspace with properties like `name` and `location`. This is perfect for parsing with tools like `jq` or JavaScript.

- **`--topological`:** Outputs the list of workspaces in topological order based on their dependencies. This means that workspaces with no dependencies will be listed first, followed by those that depend on them, and so on. This is crucial when you need to build or deploy your workspaces in the correct order. For instance, if `package-a` depends on `package-b`, `package-b` will be listed before `package-a`.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces list --topological
  ```

- **`--since`:** Filters the list of workspaces to only include those that have been modified since a specific Git commit or tag. This is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines to determine which workspaces need to be built or tested after a change.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces list --since main
  ```

  This will list only the workspaces that have been modified since the `main` branch. You can also use a commit hash or a tag name.

- **`-o` or `--output`**: Specifies a different field for the output. Default is to output name and location, but you can specify `location` to only output the location path for all the workspaces.

  ```plaintext
  yarn workspaces list -o location
  ```

  This will only print the paths to the workspaces, making it useful when combining with commands like `xargs`.

### Filtering Workspaces

You can also filter the list of workspaces by providing a pattern as an argument to `yarn workspaces list`. This pattern will be matched against the workspace names.

```plaintext
yarn workspaces list package-*
```

This will only list workspaces with names that start with "package-". For the example monorepo described earlier, this will output:

```
package-a packages/package-a
package-b packages/package-b
```

## Practical Examples and Use Cases

Now that we've covered the basics and options, let's explore some practical examples and use cases for `yarn workspaces list`.

### 1. Identifying Changed Workspaces in a CI/CD Pipeline

One of the most common use cases is to identify which workspaces have changed since the last deployment. This allows you to selectively build and test only the affected packages, saving time and resources.

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

CHANGED_WORKSPACES=$(yarn workspaces list --since origin/main --json | jq -r '.[].location')

if [[ -n "$CHANGED_WORKSPACES" ]]; then
  echo "Changed workspaces:"
  echo "$CHANGED_WORKSPACES"

  # Build and test the changed workspaces
  for workspace in $CHANGED_WORKSPACES; do
    echo "Building and testing $workspace..."
    yarn workspace $(basename $workspace) build
    yarn workspace $(basename $workspace) test
  done
else
  echo "No workspaces have changed since last deployment."
fi
```

This script uses `yarn workspaces list --since origin/main --json` to retrieve the list of changed workspaces in JSON format. It then uses `jq` to extract the `location` property from each workspace and iterates through the list, building and testing each affected package.

### 2. Running a Command in Each Workspace

Another common use case is to run a specific command in each workspace. For example, you might want to run ESLint or Prettier across your entire monorepo.

```plaintext
yarn workspaces list -o location | xargs -I {} sh -c "cd {} && yarn lint"
```

This command uses `yarn workspaces list -o location` to get a list of all workspace locations. Then it uses `xargs` to execute `cd {} && yarn lint` in each workspace directory. The `yarn lint` script should be defined in the `package.json` of each workspace.

### 3. Building Workspaces in Topological Order

When building your monorepo, it's crucial to build the workspaces in the correct order, respecting their dependencies.

```plaintext
yarn workspaces list --topological -o location | xargs -I {} sh -c "cd {} && yarn build"
```

This command uses `yarn workspaces list --topological -o location` to retrieve the list of workspaces in topological order. Then it uses `xargs` to execute `cd {} && yarn build` in each workspace directory, ensuring that dependencies are built before the packages that depend on them.

### 4. Displaying Detailed Workspace Information

If you need to inspect the configuration of a specific workspace, you can use the `-v` flag:

```plaintext
yarn workspaces list -v | grep "my-package"
```

This will output all the detailed information about the workspace named "my-package", including its dependencies, scripts, and other configuration details. The `grep` command is used here to filter the verbose output and focus only on the relevant information.

### 5. Getting a List of Workspace Names for Other Commands

Sometimes you just need a simple list of workspace names to feed into other commands. This can be achieved by manipulating the output with `awk` or `cut`.

```plaintext
yarn workspaces list | awk '{print $1}'
```

This will output only the first column of the `yarn workspaces list` output, which is the workspace name. You can use this list as input to other commands that require a list of workspace names.

## Best Practices

- **Keep your `package.json` clean:** Avoid unnecessary dependencies in the root `package.json`. Only include dependencies that are truly shared across all workspaces.
- **Use meaningful workspace names:** Choose descriptive names for your workspaces to make it easier to understand your project structure.
- **Document your monorepo structure:** Create a README file that explains the purpose of each workspace and how they relate to each other.
- **Leverage CI/CD pipelines:** Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your workspaces using a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Use `--since` wisely:** Be mindful of the base commit or tag you use with `--since`. Using the wrong base can lead to incorrect results.
- **Understand Topological Order:** The `--topological` order is crucial for build processes. It ensures that dependencies are built before those that rely on them, preventing build errors.
