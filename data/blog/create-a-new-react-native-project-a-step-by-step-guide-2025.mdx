# Create a New React Native Project: A Step-by-Step Guide (2025)

React Native is a powerful JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications for iOS and Android using a single codebase. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a new React Native project, covering two popular approaches: Expo and React Native CLI. Choose the method that best suits your project's needs and your development preferences.

## Choosing the Right Approach: Expo vs. React Native CLI

Before we dive into the setup, let's briefly compare Expo and React Native CLI:

- **Expo:** Expo simplifies the development process by providing a managed workflow with pre-configured tools and libraries. It's excellent for beginners and projects that don't require direct access to native APIs or custom native modules. Expo Go (the mobile app) makes testing and sharing your application very straightforward during development. Expo is generally faster for iteration.

- **React Native CLI:** React Native CLI offers a more flexible and customizable development environment. It's suitable for projects that need access to native code, third-party libraries that aren't available in Expo, or when greater control over the build process is required. However, it generally requires more initial setup and configuration.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature           | Expo                           | React Native CLI                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Workflow**      | Managed                        | Unmanaged                          |
| **Setup**         | Easier, faster                 | More complex, longer               |
| **Native Access** | Limited                        | Full                               |
| **Development**   | Easier Sharing, Expo Go App    | Device/Simulator Required          |
| **Updates**       | Expo Over-the-air Updates      | Build/App Store Submission         |
| **Build Process** | Easier with Expo Build Service | More manual configuration required |

## Method 1: Creating a React Native Project with Expo

Expo is the recommended approach for beginners and many projects that don't need complex native dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or yarn:** Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager). Alternatively, you can use yarn ([https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)).

### Step 1: Install Expo CLI

Open your terminal or command prompt and install the Expo CLI globally:

```plaintext
npm install -g expo-cli
# or
yarn global add expo-cli
```

### Step 2: Create a New Project

Use the `expo init` command to create a new React Native project:

```plaintext
expo init AwesomeProject
```

This command will prompt you to choose a template:

- **`blank`:** A minimal template with no pre-configured UI.
- **`tabs`:** A template with a basic tab navigation layout.
- **`(managed)` or `(bare)`:** This prompts to choose between managed (Expo) or bare (React Native CLI) workflows. Choosing `(managed)` then presents blank and tabs options.

For this example, let's choose the `blank` template within the managed workflow by pressing `Enter` until you see "blank" highlighted and then pressing `Enter` to select.

You will then be prompted for a name for the project:

```plaintext
? Choose a template: â€º blank
? Your project name: AwesomeProject
```

Press `Enter` again. Expo will now download all the necessary dependencies and set up your project.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

```plaintext
cd AwesomeProject
```

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Start the development server using the `expo start` command:

```plaintext
expo start
# or
yarn start
```

This will open the Expo DevTools in your browser. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to view the app, or you can run it on an emulator/simulator. You will need Expo Go on your phone to do this. Download it from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).

### Step 5: Running on iOS Simulator (Mac)

If you're on a Mac, you can run the app in the iOS Simulator by pressing `i` in the terminal where `expo start` is running or by clicking "Run on iOS simulator" in the Expo DevTools. You may need to install `xcodect` first (the XCode Command Line Tools), which will pop up automatically if they are missing when you first try to run the simulator.

### Step 6: Running on Android Emulator

You'll need an Android emulator set up. If you have Android Studio installed, you can create and launch an emulator. In the terminal where `expo start` is running, press `a` or click "Run on Android emulator" in the Expo DevTools.

### Step 7: Making Changes

Open the `App.js` file in your project directory with your favorite code editor. Modify the text within the `<Text>` component to see the changes reflected in your app. For example:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Hello, React Native from AwesomeProject!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

Save the file, and the Expo Go app (or simulator/emulator) should automatically reload with the updated text.

## Method 2: Creating a React Native Project with React Native CLI

React Native CLI provides more control and flexibility, but requires more initial setup.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm or yarn:** Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager). Alternatively, you can use yarn ([https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)).
- **JDK:** Install the Java Development Kit (JDK).
- **Android Studio (for Android development):** Download and install Android Studio from [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). You will need to configure the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to your Android SDK location, and add the platform-tools directory to your `PATH`.
- **Xcode (for iOS development):** Xcode is required for iOS development and is only available on macOS. You can download it from the Mac App Store.
- **CocoaPods (for iOS):** Install CocoaPods for managing dependencies.

  ```plaintext
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```

### Step 1: Install React Native CLI

```plaintext
npm install -g react-native-cli
# or
yarn global add react-native-cli
```

### Step 2: Create a New Project

Use the `react-native init` command to create a new React Native project:

```plaintext
react-native init MyAwesomeApp
```

This command will create a new directory named `MyAwesomeApp` with the basic React Native project structure.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

```plaintext
cd MyAwesomeApp
```

### Step 4: Running on iOS

- **If you have macOS:**
  - Open the `ios/MyAwesomeApp.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
  - Select your device or a simulator.
  - Click the "Run" button.

Alternatively, you can run from the command line:

```plaintext
npx react-native run-ios
```

This command will build and launch your app on the connected iOS device or the iOS Simulator. You may need to build from XCode once first to set up all necessary configurations.

**Dealing with Flipper Errors:**

If you encounter Flipper errors, try disabling it in the `Podfile` located in the `ios` directory. Comment out the line that enables Flipper:

```plaintext
# use_flipper!() # Comment this line out
```

Then, run the following commands:

```plaintext
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Step 5: Running on Android

- **Ensure you have an Android emulator running or a physical Android device connected.**
- Run the following command:

```plaintext
npx react-native run-android
```

This command will build and launch your app on the connected Android device or the Android emulator. You may need to start the emulator separately, particularly the first time you run. Also, be sure that `ANDROID_HOME` is set correctly. You can verify this in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file (or similar) on Linux or MacOS. For windows, you'll have to set the equivalent environment variable in System Properties.

Example `.bashrc` (Linux/MacOS):

```plaintext
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### Step 6: Making Changes

Open the `App.js` file in your project directory. Make some changes to the `<Text>` component, like this:

```plaintext
import React from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Welcome to MyAwesomeApp!</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
})

export default App
```

Save the file, and the app should automatically reload with the updated text. If it doesn't, try manually reloading the app using the developer menu (shake the device or press Command+M on the iOS Simulator, or press M on the Android emulator).

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues:** Ensure your Node.js, npm/yarn, and other dependencies are correctly installed and configured. Pay close attention to version requirements.
- **Android Emulator Problems:** Verify that your Android emulator is properly set up and running. Check the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable.
- **iOS Simulator Problems:** Make sure Xcode is installed and that you've selected a simulator in Xcode. Try cleaning the build folder (Product -> Clean Build Folder).
- **Metro Bundler Errors:** If you encounter Metro Bundler errors, try clearing the cache:

  ```plaintext
  npm start -- --reset-cache
  # or
  yarn start -- --reset-cache
  ```

- **"Unable to load script" Error:** This often means the bundler is not running or the app can't connect to it. Double-check that the bundler is running and that your device or emulator is connected to the same network.
