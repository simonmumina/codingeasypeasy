# HTML DOM TransitionEvent: Mastering CSS Transitions with JavaScript

CSS transitions provide a powerful way to animate changes in HTML elements, creating smooth and engaging user experiences. However, sometimes you need more control than CSS alone can offer. That's where the `TransitionEvent` interface in the HTML DOM comes in. This blog post dives deep into the `TransitionEvent`, explaining how to use it to listen for, monitor, and react to CSS transitions with JavaScript.

## What is the TransitionEvent?

The `TransitionEvent` interface represents events that occur as CSS transitions complete or are cancelled. It provides information about the transition that has occurred, such as the name of the CSS property being transitioned, the time the transition took, and the target element. This information enables you to precisely coordinate JavaScript actions with the different stages of a CSS transition.

## Key Properties of the TransitionEvent

The `TransitionEvent` interface inherits properties from its parent `Event` interface and also provides specific properties related to transitions:

- **`propertyName` (Read-only):** A `DOMString` representing the name of the CSS property the transition is applied to. For example, if you're transitioning the `opacity` property, `propertyName` will be `"opacity"`.
- **`elapsedTime` (Read-only):** A `float` representing the number of seconds the transition has been running when the event fired. Note that this isn't the total duration of the transition, but the elapsed time when the event listener was triggered.
- **`pseudoElement` (Read-only):** A `DOMString` representing the name of the pseudo-element that the transition runs on. If the transition runs on the element itself, this value is an empty string (`""`). Examples of pseudo-elements are `"::before"` and `"::after"`.

## Transition Event Types

There are three main transition event types you'll be working with:

- **`transitionstart`:** Fired when a CSS transition has actually started. This doesn't mean the transition is guaranteed to complete; it just means the browser has started the animation.
- **`transitionrun`:** Fired when a CSS transition is running. This event fires repeatedly throughout the transition duration. This is less commonly used than `transitionend`, but can be useful for tracking progress.
- **`transitionend`:** Fired when a CSS transition has completed. This is often the most useful event as it indicates that the element has reached its final state.
- **`transitioncancel`:** Fired when a CSS transition has been canceled (e.g., because the transitioned property is changed before the transition completes, or because the element is removed from the document).

## Listening for Transition Events: Code Examples

Here's how to listen for these events using JavaScript's `addEventListener` method:

```plaintext
const element = document.getElementById('myElement')

element.addEventListener('transitionstart', (event) => {
  console.log('Transition started:', event.propertyName, 'Elapsed time:', event.elapsedTime)
})

element.addEventListener('transitionrun', (event) => {
  console.log('Transition running:', event.propertyName, 'Elapsed time:', event.elapsedTime)
})

element.addEventListener('transitionend', (event) => {
  console.log('Transition ended:', event.propertyName, 'Elapsed time:', event.elapsedTime)
})

element.addEventListener('transitioncancel', (event) => {
  console.log('Transition canceled:', event.propertyName)
})

// Trigger the transition (e.g., by adding/removing a class)
element.classList.add('active')
```

And here's the corresponding CSS to define the transition:

```plaintext
#myElement {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  transition: width 0.5s ease-in-out, background-color 0.3s linear; /* Added background-color transition */
}

#myElement.active {
  width: 200px;
  background-color: blue; /* Change background color when active */
}
```

In this example:

1.  We get a reference to the HTML element with the ID `myElement`.
2.  We attach event listeners to the element for each of the four transition event types (`transitionstart`, `transitionrun`, `transitionend`, and `transitioncancel`).
3.  Inside each event listener, we log information about the transition to the console, including the `propertyName` and `elapsedTime`.
4.  We then trigger the transition by adding the `active` class to the element. This class changes the element's width and background color, triggering the transitions defined in the CSS.

## Practical Use Cases

The `TransitionEvent` is incredibly useful for:

- **Orchestrating animations:** Sequencing multiple animations by starting the next animation in the `transitionend` event listener of the previous one.
- **Synchronizing JavaScript actions with transitions:** Performing actions like loading content or updating UI elements precisely when a transition completes, ensuring a smooth and coordinated visual effect.
- **Handling transition cancellations:** Detecting when a transition is canceled and taking appropriate action, such as resetting the element's state or initiating a different transition.
- **Building complex UIs:** Creating interactive UIs where elements dynamically respond to transition events, enhancing user engagement.
- **Creating loading animations:** Use the `transitionrun` event to track the progress of loading an image or other resources.

### Example 1: Sequencing Animations

Let's say you want to fade in an element, then slide it to the right, and finally fade it out. You can use `transitionend` to chain these animations:

```plaintext
const element = document.getElementById('myElement')

// Initial state: Hidden
element.style.opacity = 0
element.style.transform = 'translateX(0)'

// Fade in
element.addEventListener('transitionend', function fadeOut() {
  element.removeEventListener('transitionend', fadeOut) // Prevent multiple executions
  // Start slide-out animation
  element.addEventListener('transitionend', function slideOut() {
    element.removeEventListener('transitionend', slideOut)
    // Start fade-out animation
    element.style.transition = 'opacity 0.5s ease-in-out'
    element.style.opacity = 0
  })

  element.style.transition = 'transform 0.5s ease-in-out'
  element.style.transform = 'translateX(100px)'
})

element.style.transition = 'opacity 0.5s ease-in-out'
element.style.opacity = 1
```

```plaintext
#myElement {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  position: relative;
}
```

This example first fades the element in. When the fade-in transition completes, the `transitionend` event triggers a slide to the right. When the slide transition completes, it triggers a fade-out. Each `transitionend` listener is removed to prevent unwanted executions of the same animation.

### Example 2: Synchronizing with Content Loading

Imagine you have a loading spinner that transitions its opacity while content is being loaded. You want to hide the spinner _exactly_ when the content is loaded.

```plaintext
const spinner = document.getElementById('spinner')
const contentArea = document.getElementById('content')

function loadContent() {
  // Simulate loading content (e.g., fetching data from an API)
  spinner.style.opacity = 1
  spinner.style.display = 'block'
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Content loaded!
    contentArea.textContent = 'Content Loaded!'
    spinner.addEventListener('transitionend', function hideSpinner() {
      spinner.removeEventListener('transitionend', hideSpinner)
      spinner.style.display = 'none'
    })
    spinner.style.opacity = 0
  }, 2000) // Simulate 2 seconds of loading
}

loadContent()
```

```plaintext
#spinner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: gray;
  opacity: 0;
  display: none;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

#content {
  margin-top: 20px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

In this example, the `loadContent` function simulates loading content. While loading, the spinner fades in. Once loading is "complete", the spinner fades out, and after the fade-out transition ends, the spinner is hidden completely (using `display: none`). This avoids the spinner being visible at opacity 0.

### Example 3: Handling Transition Cancellation

Sometimes a transition might be cancelled before it finishes. Handling the `transitioncancel` event allows you to gracefully manage this situation.

```plaintext
<div id="box"></div>
<button id="cancelButton">Cancel</button>
```

```plaintext
const box = document.getElementById('box')
const cancelButton = document.getElementById('cancelButton')

box.addEventListener('transitionstart', () => {
  console.log('Transition started')
})

box.addEventListener('transitionend', () => {
  console.log('Transition ended')
})

box.addEventListener('transitioncancel', () => {
  console.log('Transition cancelled!')
  box.style.width = '100px' // Reset to original width
})

box.style.width = '200px'

cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  box.style.transition = 'none'
  box.style.width = '300px' // Changing the width again cancels the previous transition.
  box.offsetHeight // Trigger a reflow, flushing the CSS changes
  box.style.transition = '' // Re-enable transitions
})
```

```plaintext
#box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  transition: width 2s;
}

```

In this scenario, changing the `width` style a second time within the 2s transition time will cause the first transition to be cancelled. The `transitioncancel` event fires and the event listener resets the width to the original value to avoid an unexpected visual state. The button cancels the animation by setting `transition: none` temporarily, changing the value and then re-enabling the transition. This causes a transition cancellation.

## Browser Compatibility

The `TransitionEvent` interface and its associated events have excellent browser compatibility, supported by all major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. This means you can confidently use `TransitionEvent` in your web projects without worrying about cross-browser issues.

## Conclusion

The `TransitionEvent` interface provides a powerful way to interact with CSS transitions using JavaScript. By listening for and responding to transition events, you can create more dynamic and engaging user interfaces, orchestrate complex animations, and ensure seamless synchronization between CSS transitions and JavaScript actions. Understanding and utilizing the `TransitionEvent` is a valuable skill for any front-end developer looking to enhance their web applications with smooth, interactive animations. Remember to use the examples as starting points for your own experimentation and creative explorations.
