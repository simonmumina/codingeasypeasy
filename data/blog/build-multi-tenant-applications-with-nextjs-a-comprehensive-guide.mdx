# Building Multi-Tenant Applications with Next.js: A Comprehensive Guide

Multi-tenancy is an architectural pattern where a single instance of a software application serves multiple tenants (customers, organizations, or users). This approach is highly efficient for Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, as it reduces operational overhead and infrastructure costs.  Next.js, with its server-side rendering capabilities, API routes, and excellent developer experience, is a great choice for building multi-tenant applications.

This guide will walk you through the essential concepts, architectural patterns, and practical implementation steps for building a multi-tenant SaaS application using Next.js. We'll cover everything from choosing the right tenancy model to securing your application and optimizing performance.

## Understanding Multi-Tenancy

Before diving into the code, let's define what multi-tenancy is and its different approaches:

**What is Multi-Tenancy?**

In a multi-tenant architecture, multiple tenants share the same infrastructure, including the application server, database, and other resources. Each tenant's data is isolated and secured, ensuring that they cannot access or modify other tenants' data.

**Benefits of Multi-Tenancy:**

*   **Cost Efficiency:** Reduced infrastructure and operational costs due to shared resources.
*   **Scalability:** Easier to scale the application to accommodate new tenants.
*   **Centralized Management:** Simplified management and maintenance of the application.
*   **Faster Deployment:** Quicker onboarding of new tenants.

## Tenancy Models

There are three primary tenancy models:

1.  **Single Database, Shared Schema:**  All tenants share the same database and schema. Tenant isolation is achieved by including a `tenant_id` column in each table and filtering data based on this ID. This is the simplest and most cost-effective approach, but it can be challenging to scale and manage as the number of tenants grows.

2.  **Single Database, Separate Schema:** Each tenant has its own schema within the same database. This provides better isolation and scalability than the shared schema approach.

3.  **Separate Databases:** Each tenant has its own dedicated database. This offers the highest level of isolation and scalability, but it also comes with the highest infrastructure costs and management overhead.

The best model depends on your application's specific requirements, including the number of tenants, the complexity of the data model, and the level of isolation required.  For this guide, we'll focus primarily on the **Single Database, Shared Schema** approach, as it's a good starting point and demonstrates the core principles. We'll also touch upon the **Single Database, Separate Schema** approach.

## Architectural Considerations

When designing a multi-tenant application with Next.js, consider the following architectural aspects:

*   **Tenant Identification:** How will you identify the tenant making a request? This is crucial for routing requests to the correct data and resources.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** How will you authenticate and authorize users within a tenant?
*   **Data Isolation:** How will you ensure that tenants cannot access each other's data?
*   **Routing:** How will you route requests to the correct tenant's resources?
*   **Configuration:** How will you manage tenant-specific configurations and settings?

## Implementing Multi-Tenancy in Next.js

Let's break down the implementation process into key steps, including code examples:

**1. Tenant Identification:**

There are several ways to identify the tenant:

*   **Subdomain:** `tenant1.example.com`, `tenant2.example.com`
*   **Domain/Hostname:**  Each tenant has their own domain (e.g., `tenant1.com`, `tenant2.com`)
*   **Path Prefix:** `example.com/tenant1`, `example.com/tenant2`
*   **Query Parameter:** `example.com/?tenant=tenant1`, `example.com/?tenant=tenant2` (Less common and not ideal for SEO)

**Subdomain:** This is a common and effective approach. In your Next.js application, you can use middleware to extract the subdomain from the request's hostname.

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const hostname = request.headers.get('host') || 'localhost:3000'; // Handle localhost
  const tenant = hostname.split('.')[0];

  // Check if the tenant is a valid tenant (e.g., in a database)
  const validTenants = ['tenant1', 'tenant2', 'www', 'localhost:3000']; // add www
  if (!validTenants.includes(tenant)) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/not-found', request.url)); // Redirect to a custom 404 page
  }

  // Rewrite the URL to include the tenant
  if (tenant !== 'www' && tenant !== 'localhost:3000') { // avoid redirect loops
     const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
     url.pathname = `/${tenant}${url.pathname}`;
     return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - api (API routes)
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     * - not-found (custom 404 page)
     */
    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|not-found).*)',
  ],
};
```

**Domain/Hostname:**  Similar to the subdomain approach, but you'd extract the entire hostname and map it to a tenant.

**Path Prefix:**  This approach simplifies routing within Next.js, but it requires configuring your web server (e.g., Nginx, Vercel) to forward requests with a specific prefix to your Next.js application.

**2.  Tenant-Aware Database Access (Single Database, Shared Schema):**

You'll need to modify your database queries to filter data based on the current tenant's ID.  This involves adding a `tenant_id` column to all relevant tables.

```typescript
// Example using Prisma
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function getProducts(tenantId: string) {
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: {
      tenant_id: tenantId,
    },
  });
  return products;
}
```

**3.  Tenant-Aware Database Access (Single Database, Separate Schema):**

For separate schemas, you can dynamically switch the database schema based on the identified tenant.  This is often handled at the database connection level.  Different database ORMs provide different mechanisms for this.  For example, with Prisma, you might need to create separate Prisma clients configured for each schema, or use raw SQL queries.

```typescript
// Example (Conceptual - Prisma doesn't directly support schema switching this way, but this demonstrates the concept)

// This would require more complex connection management or raw SQL
async function getProducts(tenantId: string) {
  const schemaName = `tenant_${tenantId}`;  // e.g., 'tenant_123'
  const products = await prisma.$queryRaw`SET search_path TO ${schemaName};`;
  const products = await prisma.product.findMany(); // Now queries will be against the tenant's schema
  return products;
}
```

**Important Note:** The separate schema approach might be more appropriate for larger applications where you need stronger isolation and you're willing to manage schema migrations and updates individually for each tenant.

**4. Creating a Context for Tenant Information:**

To avoid passing the `tenantId` around to every component, use React's Context API to make it globally available.

```typescript jsx
// TenantContext.tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

interface TenantContextType {
  tenantId: string | null;
}

const TenantContext = createContext<TenantContextType>({
  tenantId: null,
});

export const TenantProvider = ({ children, tenantId }: { children: React.ReactNode, tenantId: string }) => {
  return (
    <TenantContext.Provider value={{ tenantId }}>
      {children}
    </TenantContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useTenant = () => {
  return useContext(TenantContext);
};
```

Wrap your application with the `TenantProvider` and pass the extracted `tenantId` as a prop.  Then, in any component, you can access the `tenantId` using the `useTenant` hook.

```typescript jsx
// _app.tsx

import { TenantProvider } from '../context/TenantContext';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: any) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [tenantId, setTenantId] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Extract tenant ID from the URL path (assuming Path Prefix strategy)
    if (router.pathname.startsWith('/')) {
      const parts = router.pathname.split('/');
      if (parts.length > 1 && parts[1] !== 'api' && parts[1] !== '_next' && parts[1] !== "not-found") {
        setTenantId(parts[1]);
      } else {
        setTenantId(null); // No tenant ID found
      }
    }
  }, [router.pathname]);

  return (
    <TenantProvider tenantId={tenantId || 'default'}> {/* Provide a default tenant if none is found */}
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </TenantProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

**5. Authentication and Authorization:**

Implement tenant-specific authentication and authorization.  This might involve:

*   Tenant-specific user roles and permissions.
*   Storing user data (including tenant association) in your database.
*   Using a library like NextAuth.js, ensuring you properly scope authentication within each tenant.  You'll need to modify the NextAuth.js callbacks to consider the `tenantId`.

```typescript
// Example NextAuth.js callback modification
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GithubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github"

export const authOptions = {
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    })
  ],
  callbacks: {
    async session({ session, user, token }) {
      // Get the tenant ID (assuming it's stored in the request headers or a cookie)
      //const tenantId = req.headers['x-tenant-id'] || 'default';
      // session.tenantId = tenantId;  // Store the tenant ID in the session
      return session
    }
  }
}

export default NextAuth(authOptions)
```

**6. API Routes:**

Your API routes must also be tenant-aware. Access the `tenantId` (e.g., from the context, request headers, or URL) and use it to filter data and authorize actions.

```typescript
// pages/api/products.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { useTenant } from '../../context/TenantContext'; // Incorrect in API routes

// Correct approach for accessing tenantId in API routes:
export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const tenantId = req.headers['x-tenant-id'] as string || 'default'; // Or extract from a cookie

  // Assuming you have a database function to fetch products by tenantId
  const products = await getProducts(tenantId);

  res.status(200).json(products);
}

async function getProducts(tenantId: string) {
    // ... database query using tenantId
}
```

**7.  Tenant Management:**

You'll need an administrative interface for creating, updating, and deleting tenants.  This interface might include:

*   Creating a new tenant database or schema.
*   Setting up initial tenant configurations.
*   Managing tenant users and permissions.

**8.  Testing and Security:**

Thoroughly test your application to ensure data isolation and security.  Specifically, test:

*   That tenants cannot access each other's data.
*   That users can only access resources within their tenant.
*   That tenant-specific configurations are applied correctly.

## Advanced Considerations

*   **Database Migrations:**  Handling database migrations in a multi-tenant environment can be complex.  Consider using a database migration tool that supports multi-tenancy or implementing a custom migration strategy.
*   **Caching:**  Implement tenant-aware caching to improve performance and reduce database load. Use a unique cache key that includes the `tenantId`.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources across tenants.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**  Monitor your application's performance and logs, paying attention to tenant-specific metrics.  Use a logging system that includes the `tenantId` in log messages.
*   **Custom Domains:** Allow tenants to use their own custom domains.  This typically involves configuring DNS records and SSL certificates.
