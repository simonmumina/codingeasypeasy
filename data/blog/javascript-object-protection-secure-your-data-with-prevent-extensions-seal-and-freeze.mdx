# JavaScript Object Protection: Secure Your Data with Prevent Extensions, Seal, and Freeze

Data integrity is crucial in any JavaScript application. Preventing unintended modifications to your objects is paramount for maintaining stability and preventing bugs. JavaScript offers built-in mechanisms to control object mutability, allowing you to define the level of protection required. This post dives deep into three key methods: `Object.preventExtensions()`, `Object.seal()`, and `Object.freeze()`. We'll explore their functionalities, differences, and practical applications.

## Understanding Object Mutability in JavaScript

By default, JavaScript objects are highly mutable. You can freely add new properties, delete existing ones, and modify the values of existing properties. While this flexibility is often useful, it can also lead to unintended consequences, especially in larger projects with multiple collaborators or complex state management.

Consider this example:

```plaintext
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30
};

user.age = 31; // Modifying an existing property
user.city = 'New York'; // Adding a new property
delete user.name; // Deleting a property

console.log(user); // Output: { age: 31, city: 'New York' }
```

This demonstrates the default mutability. Now, let's explore how to restrict this behavior.

## `Object.preventExtensions()`: Preventing the Addition of New Properties

`Object.preventExtensions()` prevents new properties from being added to an object. Existing properties can still be modified or deleted. Think of it as a one-way gate: you can still change things _inside_ the house, but you can't build any additions.

```plaintext
const profile = {
  username: 'bob123',
  email: 'bob@example.com'
};

Object.preventExtensions(profile);

profile.username = 'robert123'; // Modifying existing property - OK
delete profile.email; // Deleting existing property - OK

try {
  profile.role = 'admin'; // Adding new property - Error in strict mode
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot add property role, object is not extensible
}

console.log(profile); // Output: { username: 'robert123' } (email is deleted, username updated)

console.log(Object.isExtensible(profile)); // Output: false
```

**Key takeaways about `Object.preventExtensions()`:**

- Prevents adding new properties.
- Existing properties can still be modified or deleted.
- Throws a `TypeError` in strict mode if you try to add a property.
- `Object.isExtensible(obj)` returns `false` after calling `Object.preventExtensions(obj)`.

**Use Cases:**

- When you want to ensure that an object only contains the properties it was initially designed with.
- When you need to enforce a specific schema on an object.

## `Object.seal()`: Preventing Additions and Deletions

`Object.seal()` takes the protection a step further. It not only prevents new properties from being added, but it also prevents existing properties from being deleted. However, values of existing properties can still be changed. Imagine sealing the house: you can't add anything to it, you can't remove anything from it, but you _can_ redecorate the inside.

```plaintext
const config = {
  apiEndpoint: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000
};

Object.seal(config);

config.timeout = 10000; // Modifying existing property - OK

try {
  config.newSetting = true; // Adding new property - Error in strict mode
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot add property newSetting, object is not extensible
}

try {
  delete config.apiEndpoint; // Deleting existing property - Error in strict mode
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot delete property 'apiEndpoint' of #<Object>
}

console.log(config); // Output: { apiEndpoint: 'https://api.example.com', timeout: 10000 }

console.log(Object.isSealed(config)); // Output: true
console.log(Object.isExtensible(config)); // Output: false
```

**Key takeaways about `Object.seal()`:**

- Prevents adding new properties.
- Prevents deleting existing properties.
- Values of existing properties can be modified.
- Throws a `TypeError` in strict mode if you try to add or delete a property.
- `Object.isSealed(obj)` returns `true` after calling `Object.seal(obj)`.
- `Object.isExtensible(obj)` returns `false` after calling `Object.seal(obj)`.

**Use Cases:**

- Configuration objects where the structure should remain fixed but values might need to be updated.
- When you want to ensure that the object's schema doesn't change.

## `Object.freeze()`: Total Immutability

`Object.freeze()` provides the highest level of protection. It prevents new properties from being added, existing properties from being deleted, and the values of existing properties from being changed. Effectively, you're putting the house in a cryogenic chamber - nothing can change.

```plaintext
const constants = {
  PI: 3.14159,
  E: 2.71828
};

Object.freeze(constants);

try {
  constants.PI = 3.14; // Modifying existing property - Error in strict mode
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'PI' of object '#<Object>'
}

try {
  constants.newConstant = 42; // Adding new property - Error in strict mode
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot add property newConstant, object is not extensible
}

try {
  delete constants.E; // Deleting existing property - Error in strict mode
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot delete property 'E' of #<Object>
}

console.log(constants); // Output: { PI: 3.14159, E: 2.71828 }

console.log(Object.isFrozen(constants)); // Output: true
console.log(Object.isSealed(constants)); // Output: true
console.log(Object.isExtensible(constants)); // Output: false
```

**Key takeaways about `Object.freeze()`:**

- Prevents adding new properties.
- Prevents deleting existing properties.
- Prevents modifying values of existing properties.
- Throws a `TypeError` in strict mode if you try to add, delete, or modify a property.
- `Object.isFrozen(obj)` returns `true` after calling `Object.freeze(obj)`.
- `Object.isSealed(obj)` returns `true` after calling `Object.freeze(obj)`.
- `Object.isExtensible(obj)` returns `false` after calling `Object.freeze(obj)`.

**Important Considerations about `Object.freeze()`:**

- **Shallow Freeze:** `Object.freeze()` only freezes the immediate properties of the object. If a property is an object itself, the nested object remains mutable. You'll need to recursively freeze nested objects to achieve deep immutability.
- **Performance:** Freezing an object can have a slight performance impact, so use it judiciously.
- **Strict Mode:** The `TypeError` exceptions are only thrown in strict mode (`"use strict";`). Without strict mode, the attempts to modify a frozen object will simply fail silently, which can be harder to debug.

**Use Cases:**

- Constants that should never be changed.
- State management in immutable data structures.
- Ensuring data integrity in security-sensitive applications.

## Comparing `preventExtensions`, `seal`, and `freeze`

Here's a table summarizing the differences:

| Feature           | `preventExtensions()` | `seal()` | `freeze()` |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Add properties    | No                    | No       | No         |
| Delete properties | Yes                   | No       | No         |
| Modify values     | Yes                   | Yes      | No         |
| `isExtensible()`  | `false`               | `false`  | `false`    |
| `isSealed()`      | `false`               | `true`   | `true`     |
| `isFrozen()`      | `false`               | `false`  | `true`     |

## Deep Freezing Objects

As mentioned earlier, `Object.freeze()` only performs a shallow freeze. To deeply freeze an object, you need to recursively freeze all nested objects. Here's an example of a deep freeze function:

```plaintext
function deepFreeze(obj) {
  // Retrieve the property names defined on obj
  const propNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj);

  // Freeze properties before freezing self
  for (const name of propNames) {
    const value = obj[name];

    if (value && typeof value === "object") {
      deepFreeze(value);
    }
  }

  return Object.freeze(obj);
}

const complexObject = {
  name: 'Company A',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown'
  }
};

deepFreeze(complexObject);

try {
  complexObject.address.city = 'New City'; // Error in strict mode
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Output: TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'city' of object '#<Object>'
}

console.log(complexObject.address.city); // Output: Anytown (unchanged)
```

## Choosing the Right Protection Level

The appropriate protection level depends on your specific needs:

- **`preventExtensions()`:** Use when you want to prevent the addition of new properties but still allow modification and deletion of existing ones.
- **`seal()`:** Use when you want to prevent both the addition and deletion of properties but still allow modification of their values.
- **`freeze()`:** Use when you want to create completely immutable objects that cannot be modified in any way. Remember the shallow freeze caveat and consider a deep freeze implementation for complex nested objects.

## Conclusion

JavaScript's object protection mechanisms provide valuable tools for controlling mutability and ensuring data integrity. By understanding the differences between `preventExtensions()`, `seal()`, and `freeze()`, you can choose the right level of protection for your objects and build more robust and reliable applications. Remember to consider the shallow freeze limitation of `Object.freeze()` and implement deep freezing when necessary for nested objects. Embracing these techniques will contribute to cleaner, more maintainable, and ultimately more secure JavaScript code.
