# SQL UNION vs UNION ALL: Understanding the Differences and When to Use Them

When working with SQL databases, you often need to combine data from multiple tables into a single result set. SQL provides two powerful keywords for this purpose: `UNION` and `UNION ALL`. While they might seem similar at first glance, they have crucial differences that significantly impact your query's results and performance. This comprehensive guide dives deep into `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, explaining their functionalities, use cases, and performance implications.

## What is SQL UNION?

The `UNION` operator in SQL is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. It's a powerful tool for aggregating data from different sources, but it's essential to understand its behavior.

**Key characteristics of `UNION`:**

- **Removes Duplicate Rows:** The most important characteristic of `UNION` is that it **automatically removes any duplicate rows** from the combined result set. This ensures that each row in the final output is unique.
- **Requires Matching Column Types:** The `SELECT` statements being combined must have the same number of columns, and the corresponding columns must have compatible data types. For example, you can combine a column of integers with a column of floats, but you can't combine a column of integers with a column of dates without explicit type casting.
- **Implicit Sorting (Often):** Although not guaranteed by the SQL standard, many database systems implicitly sort the result set produced by `UNION` to efficiently identify and remove duplicate rows. This sorting process can add overhead to the query.
- **Default Behavior:** When you simply specify `UNION`, it's equivalent to `UNION DISTINCT`.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
WHERE condition2;
```

**Example:**

Let's say we have two tables, `CustomersUSA` and `CustomersEurope`, with the following structure:

**`CustomersUSA`:**

| CustomerID | Name       | City        |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1          | John Doe   | New York    |
| 2          | Jane Smith | Los Angeles |
| 3          | David Lee  | Chicago     |
| 4          | John Doe   | New York    |

**`CustomersEurope`:**

| CustomerID | Name          | City     |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 5          | Maria Rossi   | Rome     |
| 6          | Pierre Dubois | Paris    |
| 7          | John Doe      | New York |

Now, let's use `UNION` to combine these two tables:

```plaintext
SELECT Name, City FROM CustomersUSA
UNION
SELECT Name, City FROM CustomersEurope;
```

**Result:**

| Name          | City        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| John Doe      | New York    |
| Jane Smith    | Los Angeles |
| David Lee     | Chicago     |
| Maria Rossi   | Rome        |
| Pierre Dubois | Paris       |

Notice that even though "John Doe, New York" appeared twice in `CustomersUSA` and once in `CustomersEurope`, it only appears once in the final result. This is because `UNION` automatically removed the duplicate rows.

## What is SQL UNION ALL?

The `UNION ALL` operator, like `UNION`, combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements. However, the crucial difference is that **`UNION ALL` does not remove duplicate rows.** It simply appends the result sets together, preserving all rows from each source.

**Key characteristics of `UNION ALL`:**

- **Preserves Duplicate Rows:** This is the most significant difference from `UNION`. `UNION ALL` keeps all rows, even if they are identical.
- **Requires Matching Column Types:** Similar to `UNION`, the `SELECT` statements being combined must have the same number of columns, and the corresponding columns must have compatible data types.
- **Faster Performance:** Because it doesn't need to check for and remove duplicates, `UNION ALL` is generally significantly faster than `UNION`. The database doesn't have to perform the extra step of sorting and comparing rows.
- **Order Preservation (Sometimes):** While not guaranteed by the SQL standard, the order of the rows in the result set from `UNION ALL` often reflects the order of the rows in the individual `SELECT` statements. However, don't rely on this behavior if the order is critical; use an `ORDER BY` clause.

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
WHERE condition2;
```

**Example (Using the same `CustomersUSA` and `CustomersEurope` tables):**

```plaintext
SELECT Name, City FROM CustomersUSA
UNION ALL
SELECT Name, City FROM CustomersEurope;
```

**Result:**

| Name          | City        |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| John Doe      | New York    |
| Jane Smith    | Los Angeles |
| David Lee     | Chicago     |
| John Doe      | New York    |
| Maria Rossi   | Rome        |
| Pierre Dubois | Paris       |
| John Doe      | New York    |

In this result, "John Doe, New York" appears three times, reflecting its occurrences in the original tables.

## Key Differences Summarized

| Feature      | `UNION`                           | `UNION ALL`                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Duplicates   | Removes Duplicates                | Preserves Duplicates                                 |
| Performance  | Slower (due to duplicate removal) | Faster (no duplicate removal)                        |
| Column Types | Must match                        | Must match                                           |
| Order        | Usually not guaranteed            | Usually not guaranteed, but may reflect source order |
| Use Case     | When unique rows are required     | When all rows are needed, including duplicates       |

## When to Use `UNION` vs. `UNION ALL`

Choosing between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` depends entirely on your specific needs:

- **Use `UNION` when:**

  - You need a distinct list of results.
  - You want to eliminate any duplicate rows from the combined data.
  - Performance is not a critical factor, or the number of potential duplicates is small.
  - You are unsure if the source data contains duplicates.

- **Use `UNION ALL` when:**

  - You need to include all rows, even duplicates.
  - You know that there are no duplicates in the source data, or you don't care about duplicates.
  - Performance is a critical factor, especially when dealing with large datasets.
  - You want to count the total number of occurrences of all rows, including duplicates. You can easily achieve this by adding a `COUNT(*)` to the query.

**Example Scenario: Website Statistics**

Imagine you have two tables: `WebVisitsMobile` and `WebVisitsDesktop`, each recording website visits from mobile and desktop devices, respectively.

**`WebVisitsMobile`:**

| VisitID | UserID | PageURL   | VisitDate  |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 1       | 101    | /home     | 2024-01-25 |
| 2       | 102    | /products | 2024-01-25 |
| 3       | 101    | /home     | 2024-01-25 |

**`WebVisitsDesktop`:**

| VisitID | UserID | PageURL  | VisitDate  |
| ------- | ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| 4       | 103    | /about   | 2024-01-25 |
| 5       | 101    | /home    | 2024-01-25 |
| 6       | 104    | /contact | 2024-01-25 |

- **Finding all unique pages visited (using `UNION`):**

  ```plaintext
  SELECT PageURL FROM WebVisitsMobile
  UNION
  SELECT PageURL FROM WebVisitsDesktop;
  ```

  This query will return a list of distinct pages visited, without duplicates:

  | PageURL   |
  | --------- |
  | /home     |
  | /products |
  | /about    |
  | /contact  |

- **Finding the total number of visits (including multiple visits to the same page by the same user, using `UNION ALL`):**

  ```plaintext
  SELECT PageURL FROM WebVisitsMobile
  UNION ALL
  SELECT PageURL FROM WebVisitsDesktop;
  ```

  This query will return all page visits, including duplicates:

  | PageURL   |
  | --------- |
  | /home     |
  | /products |
  | /home     |
  | /about    |
  | /home     |
  | /contact  |

  To get a count of total visits, you would likely use this query in conjunction with a `GROUP BY` clause. For instance, to count the total visits _per page_:

  ```plaintext
  SELECT PageURL, COUNT(*) AS TotalVisits
  FROM (
      SELECT PageURL FROM WebVisitsMobile
      UNION ALL
      SELECT PageURL FROM WebVisitsDesktop
  ) AS AllVisits
  GROUP BY PageURL;
  ```

  This would then return:

  | PageURL   | TotalVisits |
  | --------- | ----------- |
  | /about    | 1           |
  | /contact  | 1           |
  | /home     | 3           |
  | /products | 1           |

## Performance Considerations

As mentioned earlier, `UNION ALL` is generally more performant than `UNION` because it avoids the duplicate removal step. However, the performance difference can be significant, especially with large datasets.

Here are some factors to consider regarding performance:

- **Size of the data:** The larger the tables being combined, the greater the performance difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`.
- **Number of duplicates:** The more duplicates that exist in the data, the more work `UNION` has to do, and the greater the performance impact.
- **Indexing:** Indexes can help improve the performance of both `UNION` and `UNION ALL` queries, but they are more beneficial for `UNION` because they can speed up the duplicate identification process. Ensure indexes are in place on the columns used in the `WHERE` clauses (if any) and the columns being combined.
- **Database system:** The specific performance characteristics can vary slightly depending on the database system you are using (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle). It's always a good idea to test your queries with realistic data to assess their performance.

**Best Practices for Performance:**

- **Use `UNION ALL` whenever possible:** If you don't need to remove duplicates, always use `UNION ALL`.
- **Ensure data integrity:** If you're using `UNION ALL` under the assumption that there are no duplicates, make sure that your data is indeed free of duplicates. Otherwise, you might get incorrect results.
- **Use appropriate indexes:** Add indexes to relevant columns to speed up query execution.
- **Test your queries:** Test your queries with realistic data to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
- **Consider alternative approaches:** In some cases, there might be alternative ways to achieve the same result using joins or other SQL techniques that are more efficient than `UNION` or `UNION ALL`.

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` is crucial for writing efficient and accurate SQL queries. `UNION` removes duplicate rows, while `UNION ALL` preserves them. Choose `UNION ALL` whenever possible to improve performance, but make sure that you understand the implications of including duplicate rows in your result set. By carefully considering your needs and the performance implications, you can effectively leverage these operators to combine data from multiple tables and achieve your desired results.
