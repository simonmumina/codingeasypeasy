# How to Change the Default Port (80) in Nginx: A Comprehensive Guide

Nginx is a powerful and widely used web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. By default, it listens for incoming HTTP connections on port 80. However, for security reasons, or simply to accommodate other services, you might need to change the default port Nginx listens on. This guide will walk you through the process of changing the default port from 80 to a different port in Nginx.

## Why Change the Default Port?

There are several reasons why you might want to change the default port that Nginx listens on:

*   **Security:** While changing the port isn't a magic bullet for security, it can deter some basic port scanning attacks. Many automated attacks target the standard port 80 and port 443. Moving your web server to a non-standard port can reduce the number of these attacks.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** If another service on your server is already using port 80, you'll need to change the port Nginx uses to avoid conflicts.
*   **Reverse Proxy Setup:** When Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, you might want it to listen on a different port than the applications it proxies. This can improve security and simplify configuration.
*   **Development and Testing:** During development, you might want to run multiple instances of Nginx on the same server, each listening on a different port.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

*   A server with Nginx installed.
*   Root or sudo privileges.
*   A text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`).

## Step-by-Step Guide

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change the default port in Nginx:

### 1. Locate the Nginx Configuration File

The main Nginx configuration file is usually located in one of the following directories:

*   `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
*   `/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`
*   `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
*   `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

The exact location depends on your operating system and how Nginx was installed. A common practice is to have a `nginx.conf` file that includes configuration files from the `sites-available` directory.  Then, symbolic links are created in the `sites-enabled` directory to activate those configurations.

Let's assume your site configuration is located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.

### 2. Edit the Configuration File

Use a text editor to open the configuration file. For example, using `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

### 3. Modify the `listen` Directive

Within the configuration file, find the `server` block that defines the virtual host you want to modify. Inside the `server` block, locate the `listen` directive. This directive specifies the port Nginx will listen on. By default, it will likely be `listen 80;`.

Change the `listen` directive to the desired port number. For example, to change the port to 8080, modify the line to:

```nginx
listen 8080;
listen [::]:8080; # Also listen on IPv6
```

If you are configuring HTTPS, you will also need to update the `listen` directive for port 443 (the default HTTPS port). For example:

```nginx
listen 443 ssl;
listen [::]:443 ssl; # Also listen on IPv6
```

And change it to your desired port for HTTPS (e.g., 8443):

```nginx
listen 8443 ssl;
listen [::]:8443 ssl; # Also listen on IPv6
```

**Example Configuration Snippet (HTTP):**

```nginx
server {
    listen 8080;
    listen [::]:8080;

    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/example.com;
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

**Example Configuration Snippet (HTTPS - Requires SSL Certificate Configuration which is covered later):**

```nginx
server {
    listen 8443 ssl;
    listen [::]:8443 ssl;

    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/example.com;
    index index.html index.htm;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt; # Replace with your certificate path
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key; # Replace with your key path

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

**Important:** Make sure the `server_name` directive is correctly set to your domain name or IP address.

### 4. Configure Firewall (If Applicable)

If you have a firewall enabled (e.g., `ufw` on Ubuntu, `firewalld` on CentOS/RHEL), you need to allow traffic on the new port you've chosen.

**Using `ufw` (Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080
sudo ufw enable
```

**Using `firewalld` (CentOS/RHEL):**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Replace `8080` with the actual port number you've selected.  If you are configuring HTTPS on a different port, be sure to open that port as well (e.g., 8443).

### 5. Test the Configuration

Before restarting Nginx, test the configuration file for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful (you should see "syntax is ok" and "test is successful"), you can proceed to restart Nginx. If there are errors, carefully review the configuration file and correct them.

### 6. Restart Nginx

Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Or, depending on your system:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

### 7. Verify the Changes

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your_domain_or_ip_address:8080` (replace `8080` with the port you configured). If everything is configured correctly, you should see your website. For HTTPS, navigate to `https://your_domain_or_ip_address:8443` (or your chosen port).

If you don't see your website, check the following:

*   Nginx is running. Use `sudo systemctl status nginx` to check its status.
*   The firewall is configured correctly.
*   The Nginx configuration file has no syntax errors.
*   You are using the correct port number in your browser.

## Configuring HTTPS on a Non-Standard Port

If you're changing the default port and using HTTPS, you need to ensure your SSL certificates are correctly configured for the new port.  This involves the following:

1.  **SSL Certificate Installation:** Ensure your SSL certificate and key files are correctly placed on the server. The `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` directives in the `server` block should point to the correct paths.

    ```nginx
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key;
    ```

2.  **HTTPS Redirection (Optional):**  If you want to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, you can add the following configuration to your HTTP server block:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80; # Or your original port
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        return 301 https://$host:8443$request_uri; # Replace 8443 with your HTTPS port
    }
    ```
    This redirects all traffic from port 80 to the HTTPS port (8443 in this example).

3.  **Testing HTTPS Configuration:** Use a tool like `openssl s_client` to test the HTTPS connection:

    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect example.com:8443
    ```

    This command will output detailed information about the SSL connection, including the certificate information.

## Considerations

*   **SEO:** Using a non-standard port can negatively impact SEO, as search engines typically crawl on standard ports (80 and 443). It is generally recommended to use port forwarding or a reverse proxy to route traffic to the non-standard port while presenting your website on the standard ports.  However, if you *must* use a non-standard port, ensure all your URLs and canonical tags reflect the non-standard port.
*   **User Experience:**  Users will need to explicitly specify the port number in their browser's address bar (e.g., `example.com:8080`).  This can be inconvenient and confusing for some users.
*   **Application Configuration:**  If your website uses other applications or services, you may need to update their configuration to use the new port number.
*   **Security Groups (Cloud Environments):** If you are running your server in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), you'll need to configure the security group to allow traffic on the new port.

## Conclusion

Changing the default port in Nginx is a straightforward process that can enhance security and resolve port conflicts. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can successfully configure Nginx to listen on a different port and ensure your website remains accessible. Remember to configure your firewall, test your configuration, and consider the implications of using a non-standard port. Remember to update other application configurations and security groups accordingly.  Good luck!
