# Expo Brightness: Control Screen Brightness in Your React Native Apps

In today's mobile-first world, user experience is paramount. One often overlooked, yet crucial aspect of UX is screen brightness. Too bright, and your app can be straining on the eyes, especially in low-light conditions. Too dim, and it's difficult to see critical information. Fortunately, the Expo SDK provides a convenient and powerful API, `expo-brightness`, to programmatically control screen brightness in your React Native applications. This blog post will guide you through everything you need to know about `expo-brightness`, from installation to advanced usage scenarios.

## What is Expo Brightness?

`expo-brightness` is a module within the Expo SDK that allows you to:

- **Set the screen brightness programmatically:** You can directly set the brightness level of the device's screen using a value between 0 (completely dark) and 1 (fully bright).
- **Get the current brightness level:** Determine the existing brightness setting of the device.
- **Detect automatic brightness:** Check if the device is currently using automatic brightness adjustment.
- **Add and remove brightness listeners:** React to changes in brightness, allowing you to adapt your app's UI accordingly.
- **Control system brightness:** Set the system brightness, potentially requiring user permissions.

## Why Use Expo Brightness?

There are several compelling reasons to incorporate `expo-brightness` into your React Native applications:

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provide users with finer control over the screen brightness within your app, catering to individual preferences and environmental conditions. Think of reading apps offering a "night mode" that dims the screen significantly.
- **Accessibility:** Adjusting brightness can significantly improve accessibility for users with visual impairments or sensitivities to light.
- **Battery Optimization:** Dynamically reducing brightness can help conserve battery life, especially in apps that are used for extended periods.
- **Contextual Brightness Adaptation:** Automatically adjust brightness based on the content being displayed. For example, dimming the screen while viewing a dark image or video.

## Getting Started: Installation

Before diving into the code, let's install the `expo-brightness` package:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-brightness
```

This command will add the `expo-brightness` package to your project's dependencies. If you're not using Expo, you'll need to use `npm install expo-brightness` or `yarn add expo-brightness`. However, remember that you still need the Expo environment installed to use the module.

## Basic Usage: Setting and Getting Brightness

Now that you have installed the package, let's explore the fundamental operations: setting and getting the screen brightness.

### Setting the Brightness

The `Brightness.setBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)` function allows you to programmatically set the screen brightness. The `brightnessValue` should be a number between 0 and 1.

```javascript
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [brightness, setBrightness] = useState(0.5)

  const setAppBrightness = async (value) => {
    try {
      await Brightness.setBrightnessAsync(value)
      setBrightness(value)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error setting brightness:', error)
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize brightness on component mount
    setAppBrightness(brightness)
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Current Brightness: {brightness.toFixed(2)}</Text>
      <Button
        title="Increase Brightness"
        onPress={() => setAppBrightness(Math.min(brightness + 0.1, 1))}
      />
      <Button
        title="Decrease Brightness"
        onPress={() => setAppBrightness(Math.max(brightness - 0.1, 0))}
      />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

In this example:

1.  We import the `Brightness` module from `expo-brightness`.
2.  We use `useState` to manage the current brightness value.
3.  The `setAppBrightness` function sets the brightness using `Brightness.setBrightnessAsync()` and updates the state.
4.  We use `Math.min` and `Math.max` to ensure the brightness value stays within the valid range (0 to 1).
5.  The `useEffect` hook initializes the brightness when the component mounts.

### Getting the Current Brightness

The `Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()` function retrieves the current screen brightness level.

```javascript
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [currentBrightness, setCurrentBrightness] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const getBrightness = async () => {
      try {
        const brightness = await Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()
        setCurrentBrightness(brightness)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting brightness:', error)
      }
    }

    getBrightness()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {currentBrightness !== null ? (
        <Text>Current Brightness: {currentBrightness.toFixed(2)}</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>Loading brightness...</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to:

1.  Import the `Brightness` module.
2.  Use `useState` to store the current brightness.
3.  Use `useEffect` to call an asynchronous function that fetches the brightness using `Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()` when the component mounts.
4.  Display the retrieved brightness value.

## Detecting Automatic Brightness

Many devices feature automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light. You can detect if this feature is enabled using `Brightness.isAutoBrightnessEnabledAsync()`.

```javascript
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [isAutoBrightnessEnabled, setIsAutoBrightnessEnabled] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const checkAutoBrightness = async () => {
      try {
        const isEnabled = await Brightness.isAutoBrightnessEnabledAsync()
        setIsAutoBrightnessEnabled(isEnabled)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error checking auto brightness:', error)
      }
    }

    checkAutoBrightness()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Automatic Brightness: {isAutoBrightnessEnabled ? 'Enabled' : 'Disabled'}</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to:

1.  Import the `Brightness` module.
2.  Use `useState` to store the status of automatic brightness.
3.  Use `useEffect` to asynchronously check if automatic brightness is enabled using `Brightness.isAutoBrightnessEnabledAsync()` when the component mounts.
4.  Display whether automatic brightness is enabled or disabled.

## Advanced Usage: Brightness Listeners

Reacting to brightness changes can be useful for dynamically adjusting your app's UI or other settings. You can add a listener using `Brightness.addBrightnessListener(callback)`. The `callback` function will be executed whenever the brightness changes.

```javascript
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [brightness, setBrightness] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Brightness.addBrightnessListener(({ brightness }) => {
      setBrightness(brightness)
    })

    // Initial brightness fetch
    const getInitialBrightness = async () => {
      try {
        const initialBrightness = await Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()
        setBrightness(initialBrightness)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting initial brightness:', error)
      }
    }

    getInitialBrightness()

    return () => {
      // Clean up the listener when the component unmounts
      subscription.remove()
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {brightness !== null ? (
        <Text>Current Brightness (Listener): {brightness.toFixed(2)}</Text>
      ) : (
        <Text>Loading brightness...</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

Key points:

- `Brightness.addBrightnessListener` returns a subscription object.
- The callback function receives an object containing the new `brightness` value.
- It's crucial to remove the listener using `subscription.remove()` in the `useEffect`'s cleanup function to prevent memory leaks when the component unmounts.
- We also fetch the initial brightness upon component mount to have a value to display initially.

## Controlling System Brightness (Permissions Required)

`expo-brightness` also allows you to control the system brightness, affecting the brightness outside of your app. However, this requires the user to grant permission.

**Note:** Controlling system brightness might not be desirable in all cases, as users may prefer to manage their system brightness settings independently. Use this feature judiciously and with clear user consent.

```javascript
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness'
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Button, View, Text, StyleSheet, Alert } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(false)
  const [systemBrightness, setSystemBrightness] = useState(0.5)

  useEffect(() => {
    const requestPermissions = async () => {
      const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS)
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted')
    }

    requestPermissions()
  }, [])

  const setSystemAppBrightness = async (value) => {
    if (!hasPermission) {
      Alert.alert('Permission Required', 'Please grant permission to change system brightness.', [
        { text: 'OK' },
      ])
      return
    }

    try {
      await Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(value)
      setSystemBrightness(value)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error setting system brightness:', error)
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {hasPermission ? (
        <>
          <Text>System Brightness: {systemBrightness.toFixed(2)}</Text>
          <Button
            title="Increase System Brightness"
            onPress={() => setSystemAppBrightness(Math.min(systemBrightness + 0.1, 1))}
          />
          <Button
            title="Decrease System Brightness"
            onPress={() => setSystemAppBrightness(Math.max(systemBrightness - 0.1, 0))}
          />
        </>
      ) : (
        <Text>Permission to change system brightness not granted.</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

This example shows:

1.  Importing the `Permissions` module from `expo-permissions`.
2.  Requesting the `Permissions.SYSTEM_BRIGHTNESS` permission using `Permissions.askAsync()`.
3.  Checking if the permission has been granted before attempting to set the system brightness.
4.  Using `Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(value)` to set the system brightness (if permission is granted).
5.  Displaying an alert if the permission is not granted.

**Important:**

- `expo-permissions` is deprecated. It's highly recommended to migrate to `expo-modules`. However, for compatibility with older Expo projects, I've retained it in the example. When migrating, replace `expo-permissions` with `expo-modules` and use the appropriate permission request function from that module.
- Always handle permission requests gracefully and provide a clear explanation to the user why the permission is needed.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Respect User Preferences:** Avoid overriding user brightness settings without a clear reason and user consent. Offer an in-app setting to control brightness and allow users to revert to their preferred system settings.
- **Error Handling:** Always wrap your `expo-brightness` calls in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
- **Performance:** Avoid setting brightness excessively frequently, as it can impact performance and battery life. Debounce or throttle brightness adjustments as needed.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that your app remains usable even at very low brightness levels. Consider using high-contrast color schemes to improve readability.
- **Platform Differences:** Brightness behavior can vary slightly across different platforms and devices. Test your app thoroughly on various devices to ensure consistent results.

## Conclusion
