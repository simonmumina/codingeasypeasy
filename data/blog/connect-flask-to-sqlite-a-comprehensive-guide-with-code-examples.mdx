# Connect Flask to SQLite: A Comprehensive Guide with Code Examples

Flask, a micro web framework for Python, provides the tools you need to build robust and scalable web applications.  SQLite, a lightweight and self-contained database engine, is an excellent choice for smaller applications, prototypes, or when you don't want the overhead of a full-fledged database server like PostgreSQL or MySQL. This guide will walk you through connecting Flask to SQLite, covering everything from database setup to data manipulation.

## Why Use SQLite with Flask?

*   **Simplicity:** SQLite requires no separate server process. The database is stored in a single file, making it easy to manage and deploy.
*   **Lightweight:**  SQLite's small footprint makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments.
*   **Portability:** SQLite databases are highly portable and can be easily moved between different systems.
*   **Ease of Setup:**  Setting up SQLite is typically much simpler than setting up more complex database systems.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later is recommended).
*   **Flask:**  Install Flask using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
*   **SQLAlchemy (Optional but Recommended):** SQLAlchemy is a powerful Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that simplifies database interactions. Install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
    ```

## Method 1: Connecting to SQLite with `sqlite3` module (Directly)

This method involves using the standard Python `sqlite3` library to interact with your SQLite database. While simple, it requires writing more raw SQL queries.

### Step 1: Create a Flask Application

Create a file named `app.py` and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, g
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

DATABASE = 'mydatabase.db' # Path to your SQLite database file

# Function to connect to the database
def get_db():
    db = getattr(g, '_database', None)
    if db is None:
        db = g._database = sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)
    return db

# Function to close the database connection
@app.teardown_appcontext
def close_connection(exception):
    db = getattr(g, '_database', None)
    if db is not None:
        db.close()

# Initialize the database
def init_db():
    with app.app_context():
        db = get_db()
        with app.open_resource('schema.sql', mode='r') as f:
            db.cursor().executescript(f.read())
        db.commit()

@app.route('/')
def index():
    db = get_db()
    cur = db.execute('select * from users') # Raw SQL! Be careful about SQL injection.
    users = cur.fetchall()
    return f"<h1>Users: {users}</h1>"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Step 2: Create a Database Schema (`schema.sql`)

Create a file named `schema.sql` in the same directory as `app.py`.  This file will contain the SQL statements to create your database tables.  For example:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  username TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('jane_doe', 'jane.doe@example.com');
```

### Step 3: Run the Application and Initialize the Database

1.  Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  In a separate terminal, run the following Python code to initialize the database.  This will execute the SQL statements in `schema.sql`.  You only need to do this once when you first create the database.  You can add this logic to a route, command-line interface or a separate script:

    ```python
    from app import app, init_db

    with app.app_context():
        init_db()
        print("Database initialized!")
    ```

### Explanation:

*   **`DATABASE = 'mydatabase.db'`:**  This defines the path to your SQLite database file.  If the file doesn't exist, SQLite will create it.
*   **`get_db()`:** This function establishes a connection to the database.  It uses Flask's `g` object to store the database connection.  This ensures that the connection is reused within the same request.
*   **`close_connection()`:** This function closes the database connection after each request. This prevents resource leaks.
*   **`init_db()`:** This function reads the SQL statements from `schema.sql` and executes them against the database. This creates the database tables.  It uses `app.app_context()` to ensure that the Flask application context is available when accessing the database.
*   **`@app.route('/')`:**  This defines a route that fetches all users from the `users` table and displays them.

### Considerations for Direct SQLite Access:

*   **SQL Injection:** Be extremely careful when using raw SQL queries.  Always sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Maintainability:**  Writing raw SQL queries can make your code harder to maintain and debug.
*   **Abstraction:** This method provides little abstraction from the underlying database.  Switching to a different database system would require significant code changes.

## Method 2: Connecting to SQLite with Flask-SQLAlchemy (Recommended)

Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that simplifies database interactions using SQLAlchemy, a powerful and flexible Python ORM. This approach provides a higher level of abstraction and makes your code more maintainable.

### Step 1: Configure Flask-SQLAlchemy

Modify your `app.py` file to use Flask-SQLAlchemy:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure the database URI
basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'mydatabase.db')
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False # Suppress a warning

db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Define the User model
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<User {self.username}>'

# Create the database tables
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()

@app.route('/')
def index():
    users = User.query.all()
    return f"<h1>Users: {users}</h1>"


@app.route('/add_user/<username>/<email>')
def add_user(username, email):
    user = User(username=username, email=email)
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
    return f"User {username} added successfully!"


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Step 2: Create the Database (if it doesn't exist)

The line `db.create_all()` within the `app.app_context()` block will create the database and the tables defined by your models if they don't already exist. Run the `app.py` to automatically create the database.

### Explanation:

*   **`app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']`:**  This configures the database connection URI.  The `sqlite:///` prefix indicates an SQLite database.  The path to the database file is specified after the prefix. `os.path.join(basedir, 'mydatabase.db')` creates an absolute path to the database file relative to your script's directory.
*   **`app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False`:**  This disables Flask-SQLAlchemy's tracking of modifications.  Enabling it requires significant extra memory and is deprecated in later versions.
*   **`db = SQLAlchemy(app)`:**  This creates a SQLAlchemy instance and associates it with your Flask application.
*   **`class User(db.Model):`:** This defines a `User` model that represents the `users` table in the database.  Each attribute of the class (e.g., `id`, `username`, `email`) corresponds to a column in the table.
    *   `db.Column()`:  This defines a column in the table.  The arguments specify the data type and any constraints (e.g., `primary_key`, `unique`, `nullable`).
    *   `__repr__()` : This is a representation function for User objects to help debug.
*   **`with app.app_context(): db.create_all()`:** This creates the database tables based on the defined models. This runs inside an application context.
*   **`User.query.all()`:**  This uses SQLAlchemy's query API to retrieve all users from the database. The database interaction is abstracted away from raw SQL.
*   **`db.session.add(user)` and `db.session.commit()`:** These lines are used to add a new user to the database and commit the changes. SQLAlchemy manages the database transaction.

### Working with Data:

Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a convenient API for interacting with your database:

*   **Adding data:** Create instances of your models and use `db.session.add()` to add them to the database.  Then, call `db.session.commit()` to save the changes.
*   **Querying data:** Use the `query` attribute of your model to perform queries. You can use methods like `all()`, `filter_by()`, `first()`, etc., to retrieve data based on various criteria.
*   **Updating data:**  Retrieve the object you want to update, modify its attributes, and then call `db.session.commit()`.
*   **Deleting data:**  Retrieve the object you want to delete and then use `db.session.delete()` to remove it from the database.  Call `db.session.commit()` to save the changes.

### Benefits of Flask-SQLAlchemy:

*   **ORM Abstraction:**  Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a high level of abstraction from the underlying database, making your code more readable and maintainable.
*   **Database Portability:**  Switching to a different database system is easier with Flask-SQLAlchemy, as you only need to change the database URI and possibly some model definitions.
*   **Security:**  Flask-SQLAlchemy helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by automatically escaping user input.
*   **Data Validation:**  SQLAlchemy allows you to define data validation rules in your models, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Relationships:** SQLAlchemy makes it easy to define relationships between different tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

## Conclusion

This guide has demonstrated two methods for connecting Flask to SQLite: using the `sqlite3` module directly and using Flask-SQLAlchemy. While the `sqlite3` approach is simpler for basic scenarios, Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a more robust, maintainable, and secure solution for larger applications. Using Flask-SQLAlchemy is the recommended approach for most Flask projects that require database interaction.  Remember to prioritize security by properly sanitizing user input or utilizing the ORM's built-in protections. Happy coding!
