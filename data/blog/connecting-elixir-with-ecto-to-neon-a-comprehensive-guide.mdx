# Connecting Elixir with Ecto to Neon: A Comprehensive Guide

This guide will walk you through connecting an Elixir application, using Ecto as the database wrapper, to a Neon serverless Postgres database. Neon offers a compelling solution for serverless Postgres with features like branching, bottomless storage, and auto-suspending compute instances, making it ideal for modern, scalable applications.

## What is Neon?

Neon is a fully managed, serverless Postgres database designed for modern applications.  It offers several advantages:

*   **Serverless Architecture:** Scales automatically based on demand, eliminating the need for manual provisioning.
*   **Branching:** Enables creating isolated database branches for development, testing, and experimentation without affecting the production data.
*   **Bottomless Storage:**  Storage scales automatically with your data, without requiring manual management.
*   **Auto-Suspending Compute Instances:** Reduces costs by automatically suspending compute instances when they are idle.
*   **Postgres Compatibility:**  Fully compatible with standard Postgres, allowing you to use existing tools and libraries.

## Why use Ecto with Neon?

Ecto is a database wrapper and language-integrated query language for Elixir.  It provides a robust and reliable way to interact with relational databases, offering:

*   **Schema Definition:** Clearly define your database schema in Elixir code.
*   **Migrations:** Manage database schema changes with ease.
*   **Querying:** Construct complex database queries using a composable and readable query language.
*   **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manage database connections for optimal performance.
*   **Type Safety:** Provides type safety and validation for database interactions.

Combining Ecto with Neon allows you to build scalable and reliable Elixir applications that leverage the benefits of serverless Postgres.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **Elixir and Erlang:** Installed on your system.  You can use `asdf` or your system's package manager.
*   **A Neon Account:**  Sign up for a free Neon account at [https://neon.tech/](https://neon.tech/).
*   **Neon Project:**  Create a new project in your Neon account and obtain the connection string.

## Step 1: Create a New Elixir Project

Let's start by creating a new Elixir project using `mix`:

```bash
mix new neon_ecto_example --sup
cd neon_ecto_example
```

This creates a new Elixir project with a supervision tree (the `--sup` flag).

## Step 2: Add Dependencies

Next, add the necessary dependencies to your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defmodule NeonEctoExample.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project

  def project do
    [
      app: :neon_ecto_example,
      version: "0.1.0",
      elixir: "~> 1.14",
      elixirc_paths: elixirc_paths(Mix.env()),
      start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
      aliases: aliases(),
      deps: deps()
    ]
  end

  # Run "mix help compile.app" to learn about applications.
  def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:logger],
      mod: {NeonEctoExample.Application, []}
    ]
  end

  # Specifies which paths to compile per environment.
  defp elixirc_paths(:test), do: ["lib", "test/support"]
  defp elixirc_paths(_), do: ["lib"]

  # Run "mix help deps" to learn about dependencies.
  defp deps do
    [
      {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.10"},
      {:postgrex, ">= 0.15.12"},
      {:dotenvy, "~> 2.6"}, # For managing environment variables locally
      {:telemetry, "~> 1.0"},
      {:telemetry_metrics, "~> 0.6"},
      {:telemetry_poller, "~> 1.0"}
    ]
  end

  # Aliases are shortcuts for tasks.
  defp aliases do
    [
      setup: ["deps.get", "ecto.setup"],
      "ecto.setup": ["ecto.create", "ecto.migrate", "run priv/repo/seeds.exs"],
      "ecto.reset": ["ecto.drop", "ecto.setup"],
      test: ["ecto.create --quiet", "ecto.migrate --quiet", "test"]
    ]
  end
end
```

*   `ecto_sql`:  The Ecto SQL adapter.
*   `postgrex`:  The Postgres driver for Elixir.
*   `dotenvy`:  (Optional)  A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file. This is useful for local development and prevents you from hardcoding secrets in your code.
*   `telemetry`, `telemetry_metrics`, `telemetry_poller`: For application monitoring and performance analysis.

After updating your `mix.exs` file, run `mix deps.get` to install the dependencies.

## Step 3: Configure Ecto to Connect to Neon

Now, you need to configure Ecto to connect to your Neon database.  The most crucial part here is the connection string.  You'll find this connection string in your Neon dashboard.

### Obtaining the Connection String from Neon

1.  Log in to your Neon account.
2.  Select your project.
3.  Navigate to the "Connection Details" section.
4.  Copy the "Postgres connection string" provided.  It will look something like this:

    ```
    postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require
    ```

**Important:** Replace `[user]`, `[password]`, `[neon_hostname]`, and `[database]` with the actual values from your Neon dashboard.

### Setting up the Configuration

We'll use the `dotenvy` library to load the connection string from a `.env` file. This prevents you from hardcoding the sensitive connection string in your configuration.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** In the root of your project, create a file named `.env`.

2.  **Add the Connection String:**  Add the connection string to the `.env` file:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require
    ```

    Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual Neon connection details.

3.  **Configure `config/config.exs`:** Modify your `config/config.exs` file to use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

    ```elixir
    import Config

    config :neon_ecto_example, NeonEctoExample.Repo,
      database: System.get_env("DATABASE_URL") || raise "DATABASE_URL not set",
      pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") || "10"),
      show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true # Helpful for debugging connection issues

    # Import environment specific config. This must remain at the bottom
    # of this file so it overrides the configuration defined above.
    import_config "#{config_env()}.exs"
    ```

    *   We use `System.get_env("DATABASE_URL")` to retrieve the connection string from the environment.
    *   `|| raise "DATABASE_URL not set"` ensures that your application will fail gracefully if the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not set.  This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior.
    *   `pool_size` sets the number of database connections in the connection pool.  We also fetch this from an environment variable (`POOL_SIZE`) with a default value of 10.  Adjust this based on the anticipated load on your application.
    *   `show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true` is useful during development to help diagnose connection issues.  Consider removing or setting it to `false` in production for security reasons.

4. **Configure `config/dev.exs`:** Add the following to your `config/dev.exs` to load the `.env` file during development:

    ```elixir
    import Config

    config :neon_ecto_example, NeonEctoExample.Repo,
      migration_source: "priv/repo/migrations"

    config :neon_ecto_example, Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Postgres,
        decode_json: true,
        decode_binary: :copy

    if Mix.env() == :dev do
      Dotenvy.load()
    end
    ```

## Step 4: Create the Ecto Repository

An Ecto repository is a module that encapsulates the connection to your database.  Let's create one:

1.  **Create `lib/neon_ecto_example/repo.ex`:**

    ```elixir
    defmodule NeonEctoExample.Repo do
      use Ecto.Repo,
        otp_app: :neon_ecto_example,
        adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Postgres
    end
    ```

## Step 5: Define a Schema

Now, let's define a simple schema to represent a table in our database.

1.  **Create `lib/neon_ecto_example/user.ex`:**

    ```elixir
    defmodule NeonEctoExample.User do
      use Ecto.Schema
      import Ecto.Changeset

      schema "users" do
        field :name, :string
        field :email, :string

        timestamps()
      end

      @required_fields [:name, :email]
      @optional_fields []

      def changeset(user, attrs \\ %{}) do
        user
        |> cast(attrs, @required_fields ++ @optional_fields)
        |> validate_required(@required_fields)
        |> validate_format(:email, ~r/@/)
        |> unique_constraint(:email)
      end
    end
    ```

    This defines a `User` schema with fields for `name`, `email`, and timestamps (`inserted_at` and `updated_at`).  It also includes a `changeset` function for validating and casting data before it's inserted into the database.

## Step 6: Create a Migration

Next, we need to create a migration to create the `users` table in our database.

1.  **Create a migration using `mix ecto.gen.migration`:**

    ```bash
    mix ecto.gen.migration create_users
    ```

    This will create a new migration file in `priv/repo/migrations`.

2.  **Edit the migration file:**  Modify the generated migration file (e.g., `priv/repo/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_users.exs`) to create the `users` table:

    ```elixir
    defmodule NeonEctoExample.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers do
      use Ecto.Migration

      def change do
        create table(:users) do
          add :name, :string
          add :email, :string, null: false

          timestamps()
        end

        create unique_index(:users, [:email])
      end
    end
    ```

    This migration creates a `users` table with `name` and `email` columns, and a unique index on the `email` column.

## Step 7: Run the Migrations

Now, run the migrations to create the table in your Neon database:

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

This will execute the migration and create the `users` table in your Neon database.

## Step 8: Insert and Query Data

Let's insert some data into the `users` table and query it.

1.  **Open an IEx session:**

    ```bash
    iex -S mix
    ```

2.  **Insert a user:**

    ```elixir
    iex(1)> alias NeonEctoExample.{Repo, User}
    iex(2)> user_params = %{name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com"}
    iex(3)> %Ecto.Changeset{} = User.changeset(%User{}, user_params) |> Repo.insert()
    {:ok,
     %NeonEctoExample.User{__meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, NeonEctoExample.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers>,
      email: "john.doe@example.com", id: 1, inserted_at: ~N[2024-02-29 15:00:00],
      name: "John Doe", updated_at: ~N[2024-02-29 15:00:00]}}
    ```

3.  **Query for the user:**

    ```elixir
    iex(4)> Repo.get_by(User, email: "john.doe@example.com")
    %NeonEctoExample.User{__meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<:loaded, NeonEctoExample.Repo>,
     email: "john.doe@example.com", id: 1, inserted_at: ~N[2024-02-29 15:00:00],
     name: "John Doe", updated_at: ~N[2024-02-29 15:00:00]}
    ```

## Step 9: Connection Pooling Considerations

Ecto uses connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently. This is especially important in serverless environments like Neon, where minimizing connection overhead is crucial.

*   **Pool Size:**  The `pool_size` configuration option in `config/config.exs` controls the number of connections in the pool.  Adjust this value based on your application's anticipated load and the available resources. A good starting point is 10, but you may need to increase it for high-traffic applications.
*   **Connection Timeout:**  Configure the connection timeout to avoid hanging indefinitely if the database is unavailable.
*   **Testing Connection Pool:** It's crucial to test the connection pool behavior under load to ensure it's performing optimally and preventing connection exhaustion.  Tools like `bombadillo` can be used to simulate realistic load scenarios.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Connection Refused:**  Verify that the Neon database is running and accessible. Double-check the connection string in your `.env` file and `config/config.exs`. Ensure the correct hostname, port, user, password, and database name are used.  Also check that any firewall rules are not blocking the connection.
*   **Authentication Error:**  Ensure that the username and password in the connection string are correct. If you've recently changed your password, update the connection string accordingly.
*   **SSL Errors:**  Neon requires SSL connections. Make sure `sslmode=require` is included in your connection string.
*   **Idle Connection Timeout:** Neon's auto-suspending compute instances may cause idle connections to be closed. Configure a shorter `idle_timeout` in your `config/config.exs` to handle this gracefully.
*   **Too Many Connections:** If you're exceeding the maximum number of connections allowed by Neon, consider increasing the `pool_size` (if your application server has enough resources) or optimizing your queries to reduce the number of concurrent connections.
*   **Migration Errors:** Carefully review the migration code for any syntax errors or logical issues.  Use the `mix ecto.rollback` command to revert to a previous migration state if necessary.

## Advanced Topics

*   **Multi-Tenancy:**  Neon's branching feature makes it easy to implement multi-tenancy, where each tenant has its own isolated database branch.
*   **Read Replicas:**  Neon supports read replicas for scaling read-heavy workloads. Configure Ecto to use the read replica connection string for read-only queries.
*   **Prepared Statements:** Utilize prepared statements with Ecto for improved query performance, especially for frequently executed queries.
*   **Telemetry and Monitoring:** Leverage the `telemetry` and `telemetry_metrics` dependencies to monitor the performance of your database connections and queries.  This helps you identify bottlenecks and optimize your application.
