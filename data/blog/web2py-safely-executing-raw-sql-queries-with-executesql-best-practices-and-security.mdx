# Web2py: Safely Executing Raw SQL Queries with executesql() - Best Practices and Security

Web2py offers a powerful tool for interacting with your database: the `executesql()` function. This function allows you to execute raw SQL queries directly against your database. While this can be incredibly useful for complex queries or operations not easily achievable with the Web2py DAL (Database Abstraction Layer), it also introduces significant security risks if not handled carefully. This blog post delves into the safe and secure usage of `executesql()` in Web2py, focusing on preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities and adopting best practices.

## Understanding `executesql()`

`executesql()` allows you to bypass the DAL and directly execute SQL statements. This is particularly useful when:

- **Complex queries:** You need to perform queries that are too complex or not supported by the DAL.
- **Performance optimization:** Raw SQL might sometimes offer better performance than DAL-generated queries.
- **Database-specific features:** You need to utilize database-specific features not exposed by the DAL.

However, the power of `executesql()` comes with responsibility. Using it without proper precautions can leave your application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where malicious users can inject arbitrary SQL code into your queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete system compromise.

## The Danger of SQL Injection

SQL injection occurs when untrusted data, such as user input, is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping. For example:

```plaintext
# DANGEROUS: Vulnerable to SQL injection
def user_search(name):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % name
    rows = db.executesql(query)
    return rows

# Example vulnerable usage:
search_term = request.vars.name  # User input
results = user_search(search_term)
```

If a user enters `"'; DROP TABLE users; --"` as the `name`, the resulting SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ''; DROP TABLE users; --'
```

This malicious query would first select all users where the name is an empty string, then execute a `DROP TABLE users` statement, effectively deleting your entire user table. The `--` comments out the remaining part of the original query, preventing errors.

## Safe Alternatives: Parameterized Queries and Escaping

The key to safely using `executesql()` is to avoid string concatenation directly incorporating user input. Instead, use _parameterized queries_ or proper _escaping_ techniques.

### 1. Parameterized Queries (Recommended)

Parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements, are the _recommended_ method for executing raw SQL safely. They separate the SQL code from the data, preventing the database from interpreting user input as part of the SQL command. Web2py handles parameterization under the hood when using the DAL, but you need to manage it directly with `executesql()`.

Here's how to use parameterized queries with `executesql()`:

```plaintext
def user_search_safe(name):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"  # Use %s as a placeholder
    rows = db.executesql(query, (name,)) # Pass the parameters as a tuple
    return rows

# Example safe usage:
search_term = request.vars.name  # User input
results = user_search_safe(search_term)
```

In this example:

- We use `%s` as a placeholder for the `name` value within the SQL query. (Note: some database adapters may use different placeholders such as `?`)
- We pass the `name` variable as a tuple `(name,)` to `db.executesql()`. This tells Web2py to treat `name` as a parameter and properly escape it before inserting it into the query. The database driver will handle the escaping appropriately.

Web2py then takes care of safely escaping the input and sending it to the database as a separate data component, preventing SQL injection. The database knows that the user-provided `name` is data, not part of the SQL command, and treats it accordingly.

**Benefits of Parameterized Queries:**

- **SQL Injection Prevention:** The primary benefit is robust protection against SQL injection.
- **Improved Performance:** Parameterized queries can improve performance in some cases because the database can reuse execution plans for similar queries with different parameters.
- **Readability:** They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

### 2. Escaping (Less Recommended, Use with Caution)

While parameterized queries are the preferred method, you _can_ use escaping to sanitize user input before inserting it into the SQL query. However, this approach is more prone to errors and less secure than parameterized queries, so it's generally **not recommended** unless you have a very specific reason and understand the risks.

Web2py provides escaping functions in `db._adapter.dialect.quote_name`. However, since different databases have different escaping mechanisms, and these internal details of web2py are subject to change, building your own manual escaping is generally not recommended.

**Why Escaping is Less Desirable:**

- **Database-Specific:** Escaping rules vary between database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).
- **Complexity:** Implementing correct escaping can be complex and error-prone. It's easy to miss edge cases or introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Maintenance:** You need to stay updated with any changes in database escaping rules.

**If you absolutely must use escaping, here's the _general_ approach (but strongly consider parameterized queries instead):**

```plaintext
from gluon.dal import DAL, Field

# Assumes db is already defined.  If not:
# db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite') # Example for sqlite

def user_search_escaped(name):
    # WARNING: This is less secure than parameterized queries and should be used with caution.
    quoted_name = db._adapter.dialect.quote_name(name)  # ESCAPE THE NAME VALUE ONLY. NOT FOR DATABASE NAMES, TABLES etc.
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % quoted_name
    rows = db.executesql(query)
    return rows

# Example Usage (WITH CAUTION):
search_term = request.vars.name
results = user_search_escaped(search_term)
```

**Important Considerations for Escaping (If Absolutely Necessary):**

- **Understand Your Database:** Make sure you understand the specific escaping rules for the database you are using.
- **Escape Properly:** Use the database driver's escaping functions to escape single quotes, backslashes, and other potentially dangerous characters.
- **Quote Literals:** Always enclose escaped values in single quotes in the SQL query.
- **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit your code to ensure that your escaping logic is still effective and that you haven't introduced any new vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices for Using `executesql()`

Regardless of whether you choose parameterized queries or escaping, follow these best practices:

1.  **Minimize Usage:** Use `executesql()` only when absolutely necessary. Favor the Web2py DAL whenever possible. The DAL offers built-in protection against SQL injection.

2.  **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input _before_ using it in any SQL query, even with parameterized queries. This can help prevent other types of attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting). Check data types, lengths, and acceptable character sets.

3.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant database users only the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid using a superuser account for your application.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your code to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

5.  **Keep Web2py Updated:** Keep your Web2py framework up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.

6.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch and log SQL errors. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages to the user.

7.  **Do not escape database/schema names or table names.** Escaping functions are for literal values only. If you are manipulating database or table names via user input, you need to use a whitelist approach - only allow the user to select from a pre-defined list of valid names.

## Example: Advanced Search with Parameterized Queries

Here's a more complex example of using `executesql()` with parameterized queries for an advanced search feature:

```plaintext
def advanced_user_search(name=None, email=None, city=None):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE 1=1"
    params = []

    if name:
        query += " AND name LIKE %s"
        params.append('%' + name + '%')  # Use LIKE operator for partial matches

    if email:
        query += " AND email = %s"
        params.append(email)

    if city:
        query += " AND city = %s"
        params.append(city)

    rows = db.executesql(query, tuple(params))
    return rows

# Example Usage:
search_name = request.vars.name
search_email = request.vars.email
search_city = request.vars.city

results = advanced_user_search(name=search_name, email=search_email, city=search_city)
```

In this example:

- We build the SQL query dynamically based on the search criteria.
- We use a list `params` to store the parameters for the query.
- We convert the `params` list to a tuple before passing it to `db.executesql()`.
- We use the `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) for partial name matches.

## Conclusion

`executesql()` in Web2py is a powerful tool that provides direct access to the database. However, it must be used with caution to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities. **Always use parameterized queries as the primary method for executing raw SQL safely.** Follow best practices for input validation, least privilege, and regular security audits to ensure the security of your Web2py applications. By understanding the risks and adopting secure coding practices, you can leverage the power of `executesql()` without compromising the security of your data.
