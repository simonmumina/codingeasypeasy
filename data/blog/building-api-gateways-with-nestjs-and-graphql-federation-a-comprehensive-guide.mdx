# Building API Gateways with NestJS and GraphQL Federation: A Comprehensive Guide

In modern microservices architectures, managing and exposing multiple backend services can become complex. An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for client applications, shielding them from the complexities of the underlying microservices. This post explores how to implement a powerful API Gateway using NestJS and GraphQL Federation, leveraging the strengths of both technologies to create a unified and scalable API experience.

## What are API Gateways and Why Use Them?

An API Gateway serves as a reverse proxy, routing client requests to the appropriate backend services. It can also handle tasks like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, request transformation, and response aggregation. The key benefits of using an API Gateway include:

- **Decoupling:** Clients are isolated from changes in the underlying microservices architecture.
- **Simplified Client Experience:** Clients interact with a single endpoint instead of multiple microservices.
- **Centralized Security:** Authentication and authorization can be managed centrally at the API Gateway.
- **Improved Performance:** The API Gateway can cache responses and aggregate data from multiple microservices.
- **Scalability:** Allows for independent scaling of individual microservices.

## GraphQL Federation: Unifying Your Microservices

GraphQL Federation allows you to compose multiple GraphQL services (microservices) into a single, unified GraphQL schema. Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain of your application. The gateway then stitches these individual schemas together, presenting a seamless API to the client. Apollo Federation is the most popular implementation.

**Benefits of using GraphQL Federation:**

- **Schema Composition:** Seamlessly combines schemas from multiple services.
- **Ownership and Isolation:** Each team owns and maintains their microservice's schema independently.
- **Strong Typing:** GraphQL's strong typing ensures data consistency and improves developer productivity.
- **Query Optimization:** The gateway can optimize queries by fetching only the required data from the relevant services.

## Implementing an API Gateway with NestJS and GraphQL Federation

Let's dive into the practical implementation of an API Gateway using NestJS and GraphQL Federation.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- NestJS CLI (`npm i -g @nestjs/cli`)

**Project Setup:**

First, create a new NestJS project:

```plaintext
nest new api-gateway
cd api-gateway
```

**Installing Dependencies:**

Install the necessary dependencies for GraphQL and Apollo Federation:

```plaintext
npm install @nestjs/graphql @apollo/federation @apollo/gateway graphql @nestjs/platform-express
npm install --save-dev @nestjs/schematics graphql-tools
```

### 1. Defining the API Gateway Module

Create a module for our API Gateway:

```plaintext
nest generate module gateway
```

Create a `gateway.module.ts` file with the following content:

```plaintext
// src/gateway/gateway.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'
import { ApolloGatewayDriver, ApolloGatewayDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo'

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloGatewayDriverConfig>({
      driver: ApolloGatewayDriver,
      server: {
        // Configure server options here
        cors: true,
      },
      gateway: {
        supergraphSdl:
          process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
            ? new URL('https://your-supergraph-sdl-url') // Fetch from your supergraph schema registry in production
            : new URL('http://localhost:4000/graphql'), // Local supergraph schema location for development

        // Alternatively, you can define a service list:
        // serviceList: [
        //   { name: 'users', url: 'http://localhost:3001/graphql' },
        //   { name: 'products', url: 'http://localhost:3002/graphql' },
        // ],
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class GatewayModule {}
```

**Explanation:**

- `GraphQLModule.forRoot()` configures the GraphQL module.
- `driver: ApolloGatewayDriver` specifies that we're using the Apollo Gateway driver for federation.
- `gateway` configures the Apollo Gateway.
  - `supergraphSdl`: This is the preferred approach. Provide the URL where the supergraph schema definition language (SDL) can be fetched. This is usually a hosted solution by Apollo or a similar service for production. In development, we point to a local composition (discussed later).
  - `serviceList`: (Alternative) This allows you to explicitly define the list of participating GraphQL services, including their names and URLs. This is a good approach for initial testing but scales poorly as the number of services grows. Using the `supergraphSdl` is **highly recommended** for production.
- `server`: You can configure various server options, such as CORS.

### 2. Importing the Gateway Module into AppModule

Import the `GatewayModule` into the main `AppModule`:

```plaintext
// src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GatewayModule } from './gateway/gateway.module'

@Module({
  imports: [GatewayModule],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 3. Setting up Sample Federated Services (Microservices)

To demonstrate the federation in action, we'll create two sample microservices: `Users` and `Products`.

**3.1 Users Service:**

Create a new NestJS project for the Users service:

```plaintext
nest new users-service
cd users-service
npm install @nestjs/graphql @apollo/federation graphql @nestjs/platform-express
npm install --save-dev @nestjs/schematics graphql-tools
```

Create a `users.module.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/users/users.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'
import { ApolloFederationDriver, ApolloFederationDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo'
import { UsersResolver } from './users.resolver'
import { UsersService } from './users.service'

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloFederationDriverConfig>({
      driver: ApolloFederationDriver,
      autoSchemaFile: true, // Generates the schema automatically
      buildSchemaOptions: {
        numberScalarMode: 'integer', // or 'float'
      },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [UsersResolver, UsersService],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Create a `users.resolver.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/users/users.resolver.ts
import { Resolver, Query, Args, Int, ResolveReference } from '@nestjs/graphql'
import { User } from './entities/user.entity'
import { UsersService } from './users.service'

@Resolver(() => User)
export class UsersResolver {
  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Query(() => [User], { name: 'users' })
  findAll() {
    return this.usersService.findAll()
  }

  @Query(() => User, { name: 'user' })
  findOne(@Args('id', { type: () => Int }) id: number) {
    return this.usersService.findOne(id)
  }

  @ResolveReference()
  resolveReference(reference: { __typename: string; id: number }): Promise<User> {
    return this.usersService.findOne(reference.id)
  }
}
```

Create a `users.service.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/users/users.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { User } from './entities/user.entity'

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  private readonly users: User[] = [
    { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith', email: 'jane.smith@example.com' },
  ]

  findAll(): User[] {
    return this.users
  }

  findOne(id: number): User | undefined {
    return this.users.find((user) => user.id === id)
  }
}
```

Create a `user.entity.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/users/entities/user.entity.ts
import { ObjectType, Field, Int, ID } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@ObjectType()
export class User {
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: number

  @Field()
  name: string

  @Field()
  email: string
}
```

Finally, update your `app.module.ts` to import the `UsersModule`:

```plaintext
// src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { UsersModule } from './users/users.module'

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Start the Users service:

```plaintext
npm run start:dev
```

**3.2 Products Service:**

Create a new NestJS project for the Products service:

```plaintext
nest new products-service
cd products-service
npm install @nestjs/graphql @apollo/federation graphql @nestjs/platform-express
npm install --save-dev @nestjs/schematics graphql-tools
```

Create a `products.module.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/products/products.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'
import { ApolloFederationDriver, ApolloFederationDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo'
import { ProductsResolver } from './products.resolver'
import { ProductsService } from './products.service'

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloFederationDriverConfig>({
      driver: ApolloFederationDriver,
      autoSchemaFile: true, // Generates the schema automatically
      buildSchemaOptions: {
        numberScalarMode: 'integer', // or 'float'
      },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [ProductsResolver, ProductsService],
})
export class ProductsModule {}
```

Create a `products.resolver.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/products/products.resolver.ts
import {
  Resolver,
  Query,
  Args,
  Int,
  Field,
  ObjectType,
  ResolveField,
  Parent,
} from '@nestjs/graphql'
import { Product } from './entities/product.entity'
import { ProductsService } from './products.service'
import { User } from './entities/user.entity'

@ObjectType()
class Price {
  @Field()
  amount: number

  @Field()
  currency: string
}

@Resolver(() => Product)
export class ProductsResolver {
  constructor(private readonly productsService: ProductsService) {}

  @Query(() => [Product], { name: 'products' })
  findAll() {
    return this.productsService.findAll()
  }

  @Query(() => Product, { name: 'product' })
  findOne(@Args('id', { type: () => Int }) id: number) {
    return this.productsService.findOne(id)
  }

  @ResolveField('createdBy', () => User, { nullable: true })
  async createdBy(@Parent() product: Product): Promise<User | null> {
    const userId = product.createdById
    if (!userId) {
      return null // Or throw an error if userId is always expected
    }
    return { __typename: 'User', id: userId } // This is how you return a reference to another service.
  }

  @ResolveField('price', () => Price)
  getPrice(@Parent() product: Product): Price {
    return { amount: product.priceAmount, currency: product.priceCurrency }
  }
}
```

Create a `products.service.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/products/products.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { Product } from './entities/product.entity'

@Injectable()
export class ProductsService {
  private readonly products: Product[] = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Laptop', priceAmount: 1200, priceCurrency: 'USD', createdById: 1 },
    { id: 2, name: 'Keyboard', priceAmount: 75, priceCurrency: 'USD', createdById: 2 },
  ]

  findAll(): Product[] {
    return this.products
  }

  findOne(id: number): Product | undefined {
    return this.products.find((product) => product.id === id)
  }
}
```

Create a `product.entity.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/products/entities/product.entity.ts
import { ObjectType, Field, Int, ID } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@ObjectType()
export class Product {
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: number

  @Field()
  name: string

  @Field(() => Int)
  priceAmount: number

  @Field()
  priceCurrency: string

  @Field(() => Int, { nullable: true }) // Making userId nullable
  createdById?: number // Reference to the User service
}
```

Create `user.entity.ts`:

```plaintext
// src/products/entities/user.entity.ts
import { ObjectType, Field, Int, ID } from '@nestjs/graphql'
import { Directive } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@ObjectType()
@Directive('@key(fields: "id")')
export class User {
  @Field(() => ID)
  id: number
}
```

Finally, update your `app.module.ts` to import the `ProductsModule`:

```plaintext
// src/app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { ProductsModule } from './products/products.module'

@Module({
  imports: [ProductsModule],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Start the Products service:

```plaintext
npm run start:dev
```

**Important Federation Notes:**

- **`@key` Directive:** The `@key(fields: "id")` directive in the `User` entity (in the `products-service`) tells the gateway how to uniquely identify `User` objects when resolving references from other services. This is crucial for federation to work correctly. The `User` object in the Products service acts as a _stub_ or representation of the actual User object from the Users service. It only needs the `id` and the `@key` directive.
- **`ResolveField`:** The `ResolveField('createdBy', ...)` resolver in the `ProductsResolver` is how the Products service provides the `User` information for a product. It returns a reference using ` { __typename: 'User', id: userId };`. The Gateway sees this and knows that it needs to fetch the complete `User` object from the service that defines `User` (the Users service).
- **`ResolveReference`:** The `ResolveReference` resolver in the `UsersResolver` is how the Users service resolves the reference from the Products service (or any other service that uses the `@key` directive on the User type). It receives the `id` from the reference and returns the complete `User` object.
- **Nullable fields:** When a service references another service (e.g., Products service references Users), it's important to make the referenced field (e.g., `createdById` in the `Product` entity) nullable if the relationship is optional. This ensures that the gateway can handle cases where the referenced entity doesn't exist or isn't available.

### 4. Composing the Supergraph Schema (Development)

For local development, you'll need a way to compose the individual service schemas into a single supergraph schema. The simplest approach is to use the Apollo CLI and the rover tool.

**Install Rover**

Follow instructions here: [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/)

**Generating and Composing the Supergraph SDL**

1.  **Generate Schema for each service:**

    In the root of the `users-service` project, run:

    ```plaintext
    rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml
    ```

    You'll need to create a `supergraph.yaml` file in the root of the project:

    ```plaintext
    subgraphs:
      users:
        routing_url: http://localhost:3001/graphql
        schema:
          file: ./schema.graphql # Location of your generated schema
    ```

    Replace `./schema.graphql` with the actual path to your graphql schema file and `./supergraph.yaml` with the correct supergraph configuration. This is usually `./schema.graphql` by default based on the `autoSchemaFile: true` setting.

    Repeat these steps for the `products-service` project, creating a `supergraph.yaml` file like this:

    ```plaintext
    subgraphs:
      products:
        routing_url: http://localhost:3002/graphql
        schema:
          file: ./schema.graphql # Location of your generated schema
    ```

2.  **Create a Supergraph Composition:**

    Create a directory to hold the supergraph composition (e.g., `supergraph`). Inside this directory, create a `supergraph.yaml` file that references the individual subgraph configs:

    ```plaintext
    subgraphs:
      users:
        routing_url: http://localhost:3001/graphql
        schema:
          file: ../users-service/schema.graphql
      products:
        routing_url: http://localhost:3002/graphql
        schema:
          file: ../products-service/schema.graphql
    ```

    **Important:** Adjust the `file` paths to correctly point to the generated schema files in your subgraphs' project directories.

3.  **Compose the Supergraph:**

    Navigate to the `supergraph` directory in your terminal and run:

    ```plaintext
    rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml > supergraph.graphql
    ```

    This will generate the `supergraph.graphql` file containing the composed schema.

4.  **Serve the Supergraph SDL (Development):**

    For local development, you can serve the `supergraph.graphql` file using a simple HTTP server. One easy way is with `npx serve`:

    ```plaintext
    npx serve .
    ```

    (Make sure you're in the `supergraph` directory). This will typically serve the files at `http://localhost:3000`. Update your `gateway.module.ts` file to point to this URL:

    ```plaintext
    // src/gateway/gateway.module.ts
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
    import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'
    import { ApolloGatewayDriver, ApolloGatewayDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo'

    @Module({
      imports: [
        GraphQLModule.forRoot<ApolloGatewayDriverConfig>({
          driver: ApolloGatewayDriver,
          server: {
            cors: true,
          },
          gateway: {
            supergraphSdl: new URL('http://localhost:3000/supergraph.graphql'), // Use the local file server
          },
        }),
      ],
    })
    export class GatewayModule {}
    ```

**Alternative: Local composition with Apollo Studio**

Another option (and recommended) is using Apollo Studio's local schema composition features. This allows you to visualize and debug your supergraph. Refer to Apollo's documentation for detailed instructions. You would still need to register for an Apollo Studio account (free tier is available).

### 5. Running the API Gateway

Now that you have the API Gateway, Users service, and Products service configured, you can run the API Gateway:

```plaintext
# In the api-gateway project
npm run start:dev
```

The API Gateway will be running on `http://localhost:3000/graphql` (or the port you configured).

### 6. Testing the Federated API

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/graphql`. You should see the GraphQL Playground. Now, you can execute queries that combine data from both the Users and Products services.

**Example Query:**

```plaintext
query {
  products {
    id
    name
    price {
      amount
      currency
    }
    createdBy {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

This query retrieves a list of products, including their prices and the details of the user who created them. The API Gateway intelligently routes the requests to the appropriate microservices (Products for product details and Users for user details) and aggregates the results.

### 7. Production Considerations

- **Supergraph Schema Management:** In a production environment, you'll need a robust way to manage your supergraph schema. Apollo Studio's schema registry is a popular option. It allows you to store, version, and validate your supergraph schema. You would update the `supergraphSdl` in `gateway.module.ts` to point to the URL of your supergraph in Apollo Studio.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement authentication and authorization at the API Gateway to protect your microservices. NestJS provides excellent support for Passport.js and other authentication libraries.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect your services from abuse by implementing rate limiting at the API Gateway.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of your API Gateway and microservices. Consider using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle errors and provide informative error messages to clients.
- **Caching:** Implement caching at the API Gateway to improve performance and reduce load on your microservices. Redis or Memcached are common options.
- **Security Headers:** Add security headers to the HTTP responses to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Deployment:** Deploy your API Gateway and microservices using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.
- **Service Discovery:** Use a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul, etcd) to dynamically discover the locations of your microservices.

## Conclusion

This post has demonstrated how to build a powerful API Gateway using NestJS and GraphQL Federation. By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, you can create a unified and scalable API experience for your clients, while simplifying the management of your microservices architecture. Remember to carefully consider the production considerations outlined above to ensure a robust and secure API Gateway. By following these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to building a modern, scalable, and maintainable microservices architecture. Good luck!
