# Secure Web2py Applications: Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of malware. By implementing CSP, you essentially tell the browser which sources are considered legitimate for loading resources like scripts, styles, images, and more. This reduces the attack surface and enhances the security of your Web2py application.

This guide will walk you through the process of implementing CSP in your Web2py application, providing detailed instructions and code examples.

## What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?

CSP works by defining a policy for your web application that instructs the browser which sources of content are authorized to be loaded. This is done by sending a `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header from your server. The browser then enforces these rules, blocking any resources that violate the policy.

**Key Benefits of Using CSP:**

- **Mitigates XSS Attacks:** By explicitly defining trusted sources for scripts, CSP prevents the browser from executing malicious scripts injected by attackers.
- **Reduces the Impact of Clickjacking:** CSP can help prevent clickjacking attacks by restricting where your content can be framed.
- **Reduces the Risk of Code Injection:** CSP can limit the sources from which stylesheets and other assets are loaded, reducing the risk of malicious code injection.
- **Improved Security Posture:** Implementing CSP contributes to a stronger overall security posture for your web application.

## Implementing CSP in Web2py

There are several ways to implement CSP in Web2py. We'll explore a common and recommended approach using a middleware component.

### 1. Create a Middleware Component

Web2py uses WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), allowing you to use middleware to modify request and response objects. We will create a middleware to inject the CSP header.

Create a file named `csp_middleware.py` within your application's `modules` directory (e.g., `applications/myapp/modules/csp_middleware.py`).

```plaintext
# applications/myapp/modules/csp_middleware.py

class CSPMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, application, config):
        self.application = application
        self.config = config  # CSP Configuration

    def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
        def custom_start_response(status, headers, exc_info=None):
            csp_header = ('Content-Security-Policy', self.config)
            headers.append(csp_header)
            return start_response(status, headers, exc_info)

        return self.application(environ, custom_start_response)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`CSPMiddleware` Class:** This class defines the middleware.
- **`__init__` Method:** Initializes the middleware with the application and a CSP configuration. The `config` parameter will hold our CSP policy string.
- **`__call__` Method:** This method is the core of the middleware. It intercepts the request before it reaches your Web2py application and modifies the response headers.
  - It wraps the original `start_response` function with `custom_start_response`.
  - `custom_start_response` adds the `Content-Security-Policy` header to the response headers before calling the original `start_response`.

### 2. Configure CSP Policy

Now, define your CSP policy in your `db.py` file or a dedicated configuration file within your application. Choose a policy that fits your specific needs. A basic example that allows scripts from the same origin and inline styles looks like this:

```plaintext
# applications/myapp/models/db.py (or a separate config file)

csp_config = (
    "default-src 'self'; "
    "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "  # Example: Allow scripts from same origin and inline scripts
    "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "    # Example: Allow styles from same origin and inline styles
    "img-src 'self' data:; "               # Example: Allow images from same origin and data URIs
    "font-src 'self'; "
    "connect-src 'self';"                #Allows XmlHttpRequest (AJAX), WebSocket and EventSource connections to the listed origin(s).
    "frame-ancestors 'self';"              #Specifies valid parents that may embed a page using <frame>, <iframe>, <object>, <embed>, or <applet>. Setting this directive to 'none' is similar to X-Frame-Options: DENY.
)
```

**CSP Directives Explained:**

- **`default-src`**: A fallback directive that applies to any resource type not explicitly covered by other directives.
- **`script-src`**: Specifies valid sources for JavaScript.
  - `'self'` : Allows scripts from the same origin as the document.
  - `'unsafe-inline'` : Allows inline JavaScript (e.g., `<script>...</script>`). Use with caution! Try to move scripts to external files whenever possible. This is only used as an example; strongly consider removing this from your production policy!
  - `'unsafe-eval'` : Allows the use of mechanisms like `eval()` and `new Function()` that convert a string to executable code. _Never_ allow this directive on production sites.
- **`style-src`**: Specifies valid sources for stylesheets.
  - `'self'` : Allows stylesheets from the same origin.
  - `'unsafe-inline'` : Allows inline styles (e.g., `<style>...</style>` and `style` attributes). Use with caution! Try to avoid inline styles if possible. This is only used as an example; strongly consider removing this from your production policy!
- **`img-src`**: Specifies valid sources for images.
  - `'self'` : Allows images from the same origin.
  - `data:` : Allows images embedded as data URIs (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,...`).
- **`font-src`**: Specifies valid sources for fonts.
  - `'self'` : Allows fonts from the same origin.
- **`connect-src`**: Specifies valid sources for network connections (AJAX, WebSockets, EventSource).
  - `'self'` : Allows connections to the same origin.
- **`frame-ancestors`**: Specifies valid sources that can embed the current page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>`.
  - `'self'` : Allows the page to be embedded only by pages from the same origin.

**Important Considerations:**

- **`'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`:** These directives significantly weaken the security provided by CSP. Use them only when absolutely necessary and strive to eliminate their usage as you refactor your code.
- **Nonce and Hash-based CSP:** For more granular control over inline scripts and styles, consider using nonces (random tokens) or hashes. This requires dynamically generating CSP policies and adding the nonce or hash to the appropriate tags in your HTML. This is beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial but is a best practice for production environments.

### 3. Activate the Middleware

Modify your `routes.py` file (e.g., `applications/myapp/routes.py`) to activate the CSP middleware.

```plaintext
# applications/myapp/routes.py

from applications.myapp.modules.csp_middleware import CSPMiddleware
from applications.myapp.models.db import csp_config # Import the CSP Configuration

routes_in = [
    ('/(.*)', 'myapp', 'default', dict(wsgi_middleware=[(CSPMiddleware, {'config': csp_config})])), # Apply to all requests
    # Add other routes as needed
]

routes_out = [
    ('/static/(.*)', '/_static/myapp/\\1'),
]
```

**Explanation:**

- **`from applications.myapp.modules.csp_middleware import CSPMiddleware`**: Imports the `CSPMiddleware` class we created.
- **`from applications.myapp.models.db import csp_config`**: Imports the `csp_config` variable containing your CSP policy string.
- **`wsgi_middleware=[(CSPMiddleware, {'config': csp_config})]`**: This line adds the `CSPMiddleware` to the WSGI pipeline. The `config` argument is passed to the middleware's constructor, providing the CSP policy.
  - The route `('/(.*)', 'myapp', 'default', ...)` applies the middleware to all requests to your application. You can adjust the route to apply the middleware to specific controllers or actions if needed.

### 4. Testing Your CSP Implementation

1.  **Inspect Browser Console:** Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) and navigate to your Web2py application. If there are any CSP violations, the browser will report them in the console. This is your primary tool for debugging your policy. It will show you exactly which resources are being blocked and why.
2.  **Use Online CSP Analyzers:** Tools like [CSP Evaluator](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/) can analyze your CSP policy and identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.
3.  **Reporting CSP Violations (Optional):** You can configure CSP to report violations to a specific endpoint. This allows you to monitor and analyze CSP violations in real-time, helping you to refine your policy. This involves adding a `report-uri` directive to your CSP header and implementing a handler on your server to receive the reports.

    Example `report-uri` directive:

    ```plaintext
    csp_config = (
        "default-src 'self'; "
        "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "
        "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "
        "img-src 'self' data:; "
        "font-src 'self'; "
        "connect-src 'self';"
        "frame-ancestors 'self';"
        "report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;" # Add this!
    )
    ```

    You would then need to create a controller/action in Web2py to handle the reports sent to `/csp-report-endpoint`.

### Example CSP Policy with Explanation

```plaintext
csp_config = (
    "default-src 'self'; "
    "script-src 'self' https://code.jquery.com; " #Allows scripts from the same domain as the document, and also allows scripts that are loaded from the jquery CDN.
    "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; " # Allows style tags from the same domain, also allows inline styles, and allows loading style sheets from google fonts.
    "img-src 'self' data: https://example.com; " # Allows image tags from the same domain, allows data URIs, and allows loading images from example.com.
    "font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; " #Allows fonts from the same domain, and allows loading fonts from google fonts static
    "connect-src 'self' wss://example.com; " #Allows XmlHttpRequest (AJAX), WebSocket and EventSource connections to the listed origin(s). It also allows websocket requests to "wss://example.com".
    "media-src 'self'; " # Applies to <audio>, <video> and <track> elements.
    "object-src 'none'; " #Controls the locations from which the application can load plugins.  Set to none to disable plugins.
    "frame-ancestors 'self' https://trusted-site.com; " #Specifies valid parents that may embed a page using <frame>, <iframe>, <object>, <embed>, or <applet>.
    "base-uri 'self'; " # Restricts the URLs which can be used in a document's <base> element.
    "form-action 'self'; " # Specifies valid endpoints for <form> submissions.
    "upgrade-insecure-requests; " # Instructs user agents to treat all of a site's insecure URLs (those served over HTTP) as though they have been replaced with secure URLs (those served over HTTPS).
    "block-all-mixed-content; " #prevents loading any HTTP resources when the request is made using HTTPS.
    "report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;"
)
```

### Iterating on Your CSP Policy

Implementing CSP is an iterative process. You'll likely start with a restrictive policy and gradually loosen it as needed to allow legitimate resources to load. The browser console is your friend! Use it to identify violations and adjust your policy accordingly. Monitor your CSP reports if you have them enabled, and remember to test thoroughly after making changes.

## Conclusion

Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) is a crucial step in securing your Web2py applications against common web vulnerabilities. By following this guide and carefully configuring your CSP policy, you can significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks and improve the overall security posture of your application. Remember to test your policy thoroughly and iterate as needed to ensure it meets your specific needs.
