# Django REST Framework: How to Throttle API Requests (Rate Limiting)

In today's web development landscape, securing APIs and managing resource consumption is paramount. Uncontrolled API access can lead to server overload, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and overall system instability. Django REST Framework (DRF) provides a robust and flexible solution for throttling API requests, also known as rate limiting. This blog post will guide you through the process of implementing throttling in your DRF APIs, covering various throttling classes, customization options, and best practices.

## What is API Throttling (Rate Limiting)?

API throttling is a technique used to control the rate at which users or clients can make requests to an API endpoint. By limiting the number of requests allowed within a specific time frame, you can:

- **Prevent abuse:** Throttling safeguards your API against malicious attacks like DDoS.
- **Protect resources:** It prevents a single user or client from consuming excessive server resources.
- **Ensure fair usage:** Throttling allocates resources fairly among all users, preventing any single user from hogging the API.
- **Improve API stability:** By controlling the request rate, you improve the overall stability and performance of your API.
- **Control costs:** For cloud-based APIs, excessive usage can lead to unexpected costs. Throttling can help manage these costs.

## DRF Throttling Classes

DRF offers several built-in throttling classes that you can use out of the box. These classes define the logic for determining whether a request should be throttled.

1.  **`AnonRateThrottle`:** Throttles requests based on the IP address of the unauthenticated user. This is a simple and effective way to prevent anonymous abuse.
2.  **`UserRateThrottle`:** Throttles requests based on the authenticated user ID. This is useful for limiting the number of requests an individual user can make.
3.  **`ScopedRateThrottle`:** Provides rate limiting based on specific views. It requires explicit configuration for each view and is generally used when different endpoints require different throttling rules.

## Implementing Throttling in DRF

Let's explore how to implement these throttling classes in your Django REST Framework API.

### 1. Global Throttling

Global throttling applies to all API views in your project. You configure it in your `settings.py` file:

```plaintext
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '100/day',  # Allow 100 anonymous requests per day
        'user': '1000/day' # Allow 1000 authenticated user requests per day
    }
}
```

- `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES`: A list of throttling classes that will be applied globally.
- `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES`: A dictionary that defines the rate limits for each throttle class. The keys correspond to the throttle scopes (e.g., `'anon'` for `AnonRateThrottle`, `'user'` for `UserRateThrottle`). The values are rate strings in the format `'num_requests/period'`. Common periods include `'second'`, `'minute'`, `'hour'`, and `'day'`.

**Example:**

With the above configuration, anonymous users are limited to 100 requests per day, and authenticated users are limited to 1000 requests per day across your entire API.

### 2. Per-View Throttling

You can apply throttling to specific views or viewsets. This allows you to customize the rate limits based on the importance or resource intensity of each endpoint.

**Example:**

```plaintext
# views.py

from rest_framework import viewsets
from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

class ExampleViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # ... your serializer and queryset

    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
    throttle_classes = [UserRateThrottle]
    throttle_scope = 'example' #defines which throttle settings to use

    # ... your viewset logic
```

```plaintext
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    # other settings
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '100/day',
        'user': '1000/day', # Global user rate
        'example': '20/minute' # Rate for the ExampleViewSet
    }
}
```

Here:

- `throttle_classes`: A list of throttling classes to apply to this specific viewset. Note that we are also using global `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES` above as well.
- `throttle_scope`: A string that maps this viewset to a specific rate limit defined in `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES`.
- The `example` scope in `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` defines that the `ExampleViewSet` allows 20 requests per minute for authenticated users.

### 3. Scoped Throttling

`ScopedRateThrottle` requires an explicit scope to be assigned on each view. This is done via the `throttle_scope` attribute on the view, as shown in the Per-View Throttling example. The rate limit for that scope is defined in the `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` setting, ensuring tight control over individual endpoints. Remember to set up the appropriate `throttle_classes` list, either globally or on a per-view basis.

### 4. Custom Throttling

You can create custom throttling classes to implement more complex throttling logic based on your specific requirements. This allows you to tailor the rate limiting to factors beyond just IP addresses or user IDs.

**Example:** Throttling based on API key

```plaintext
# throttling.py

from rest_framework.throttling import BaseThrottle
from rest_framework import exceptions

class APIRateThrottle(BaseThrottle):
    """
    Throttle requests based on a custom API key.
    """
    scope = 'api_key'

    def __init__(self):
        self.num_requests = None
        self.duration = None
        super().__init__()

    def get_cache_key(self, request, view):
        api_key = request.META.get('HTTP_API_KEY')
        if not api_key:
            return None  # Don't throttle if no API key is provided

        return f"throttle_api_{api_key}"

    def allow_request(self, request, view):
        if not request.META.get('HTTP_API_KEY'):
           return True  # Allow if no API key provided

        key = self.get_cache_key(request, view)
        if key is None:
            return True # Don't throttle if cache key is not found.

        self.num_requests, self.duration = self.parse_rate(self.rate)
        self.available_requests = self.get_available_requests(request, view)

        if self.available_requests < 1:
             return self.throttle_failure()

        self.throttle_success()
        return True


    def get_available_requests(self, request, view):
       """
       Returns number of requests based on API key
       """
       from django.core.cache import cache
       key = self.get_cache_key(request, view)
       current_value = cache.get(key,0)

       return self.num_requests - current_value

    def throttle_failure(self):
        """
        Called when throttle failed.
        """
        raise exceptions.Throttled(detail="API key rate limit exceeded.  Please try again later.")

    def throttle_success(self):
         """
         Called when a request to the throttle is successful
         """
         from django.core.cache import cache
         key = self.get_cache_key(self.request, self.view)

         current_value = cache.get(key,0)

         current_value += 1
         cache.set(key, current_value, self.duration)


    def parse_rate(self, rate):
        if rate is None:
            return (None, None)
        num, period = rate.split('/')
        num_requests = int(num)
        duration = self.duration_to_seconds(period)
        return (num_requests, duration)


    def duration_to_seconds(self, period):
        """
        convert different period types into seconds
        """
        if period == 's':
            return 1
        elif period == 'm':
            return 60
        elif period == 'h':
            return 60 * 60
        elif period == 'd':
            return 60 * 60 * 24
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid duration: %s" % period)

```

```plaintext
# views.py

from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny
from .throttling import APIRateThrottle # Import your custom throttle

class MyAPIView(generics.ListAPIView):
    # ... your serializer and queryset
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]
    throttle_classes = [APIRateThrottle] # Use the custom throttle
    throttle_scope = 'api_key' # Use the custom throttle

    # ... your view logic
```

```plaintext
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    # other settings
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '100/day',
        'user': '1000/day',
        'api_key': '5/m'  # Allow 5 requests per minute for each API key
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `APIRateThrottle`: A custom throttle class that checks for an `API_KEY` in the request headers. It throttles requests based on the unique API key.
- `get_cache_key()`: Generates a unique cache key based on the API key. This key is used to track the number of requests made with that key. If no API Key is given, throttling is ignored (returns None).
- `allow_request()`: Determines whether the request should be allowed based on the configured rate limit. It increments the request count in the cache if the request is allowed.
- The `api_key` scope in `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` defines that each API key allows 5 requests per minute.

**Important Considerations for Custom Throttling:**

- **Caching:** Custom throttling often relies on caching mechanisms (like Django's cache) to track request counts. Ensure you have a properly configured cache setup.
- **Header Inspection:** Be mindful of how you retrieve identifying information from the request (e.g., API keys). Validate headers to prevent spoofing.
- **Error Handling:** Provide informative error messages when a request is throttled.

## Testing Throttling

It's crucial to test your throttling implementation to ensure it's working as expected. You can use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or write automated tests with the Django test client.

**Example using `curl`:**

1.  **Make a request:**

    ```plaintext
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/your-endpoint/
    ```

2.  **Repeat the request quickly:** If you exceed the configured rate limit, you should receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header. The `Retry-After` header indicates how many seconds to wait before making another request.

## Best Practices for API Throttling

- **Choose the right throttling class:** Select the throttling class that best suits your needs. Consider whether you need global throttling, per-view throttling, or custom logic.
- **Configure reasonable rate limits:** Set rate limits that are high enough to allow legitimate users to access your API but low enough to prevent abuse.
- **Provide informative error messages:** When a request is throttled, provide a clear and helpful error message to the user. Include the `Retry-After` header.
- **Monitor your API:** Monitor your API traffic to identify potential abuse and adjust your throttling settings as needed.
- **Use caching effectively:** Caching is essential for efficient throttling. Ensure you have a properly configured cache setup.
- **Consider tiered rate limits:** If you have different user groups or subscription levels, you can implement tiered rate limits that provide higher request allowances for premium users. This often involves custom throttling logic.
- **Document your rate limits:** Clearly document your rate limits in your API documentation so that developers understand the constraints.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Consider returning partial or cached data instead of a 429 error when throttling kicks in. This provides a better user experience.
- **IP Address Throttling Caveats:** Be aware that IP address-based throttling can be less effective for users behind a NAT or proxy server because multiple users might share the same IP address.

## Conclusion

Throttling is an essential security measure for any API. Django REST Framework provides a flexible and powerful set of tools for implementing throttling in your API. By understanding the different throttling classes, configuration options, and best practices, you can protect your API from abuse, ensure fair resource allocation, and improve its overall stability and performance. Remember to test your throttling implementation thoroughly and monitor your API traffic to make informed adjustments as needed. By taking a proactive approach to rate limiting, you can build a more secure and resilient API.
