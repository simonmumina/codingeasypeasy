# How to Enable Nginx to Start Automatically on Boot (Systemd, Upstart, and SysVinit)

Ensuring your Nginx web server automatically starts on boot is crucial for maintaining a reliable and always-available online presence. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring Nginx to start automatically across various Linux distributions using three common initialization systems: Systemd, Upstart, and SysVinit. We'll cover each method in detail, providing practical examples and troubleshooting tips.

## Understanding Initialization Systems

Before diving into the specific configurations, let's briefly understand the roles of Systemd, Upstart, and SysVinit in managing system services:

- **Systemd:** The modern initialization system widely adopted by most Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS 7 and later, and many others. It offers improved performance, parallel startup capabilities, and enhanced service management features.

- **Upstart:** A legacy initialization system previously used by Ubuntu (before 15.04) and other distributions. While less common now, understanding Upstart can be helpful for managing older systems.

- **SysVinit:** The oldest and most traditional initialization system, still found in some older Linux distributions or embedded systems.

**Why is Automatic Startup Important?**

Imagine a server reboot due to a power outage or scheduled maintenance. Without proper configuration, Nginx might not start automatically, leading to website downtime and potentially lost revenue. Enabling automatic startup ensures your web server is back online as quickly as possible.

## Method 1: Using Systemd (Recommended)

Systemd is the recommended and most reliable way to configure Nginx to start on boot for modern Linux distributions.

**Step 1: Verify Nginx Installation and Status**

First, ensure Nginx is correctly installed and running. Use the following commands:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

This command will display the current status of the Nginx service. If it's not running, start it with:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

**Step 2: Enable Nginx Service for Automatic Startup**

To enable Nginx to start on boot, use the `systemctl enable` command:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

This command creates a symbolic link from the systemd service file to the appropriate startup directory. The exact location varies depending on the distribution, but systemd handles this automatically.

**Step 3: Verify Automatic Startup Configuration**

After enabling the service, you can verify the configuration with:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl is-enabled nginx
```

If the output is `enabled`, then Nginx is correctly configured to start on boot.

**Step 4: Testing (Optional but Recommended)**

To fully verify, you can reboot your server:

```plaintext
sudo reboot
```

After the reboot, check the status of Nginx:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

It should show that Nginx is active and running.

**Systemd Service File (nginx.service)**

The underlying mechanism for Systemd's management is the `nginx.service` file. This file contains instructions on how to start, stop, and manage the Nginx service. The file is typically located in `/lib/systemd/system/` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`. You generally don't need to modify this file unless you have specific customization requirements. Here's an example of what a typical `nginx.service` file looks like:

```
[Unit]
Description=The Nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/run/nginx.pid
ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx
ExecReload=/usr/sbin/nginx -s reload
ExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Explanation:**

- **[Unit]:** Contains metadata about the service, such as its description and dependencies (e.g., requiring the network to be available).
- **[Service]:** Defines how the service is executed, including the PID file, startup commands (`ExecStart`), reload commands (`ExecReload`), and stop commands (`ExecStop`). `Type=forking` indicates that Nginx forks a child process and the parent process exits.
- **[Install]:** Specifies when the service should be started during the boot process. `WantedBy=multi-user.target` indicates that it should be started when the system enters the multi-user state (normal operation).

## Method 2: Using Upstart (For Older Ubuntu Versions - e.g., 14.04)

If you're running an older Ubuntu version that uses Upstart, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Locate the Nginx Upstart Configuration File**

The Nginx Upstart configuration file is typically located at `/etc/init/nginx.conf`.

**Step 2: Verify the File Contents**

Make sure the file exists and contains the following structure (or similar):

```
description "Nginx http daemon"
author      "Ubuntu"

start on (filesystem
          and net-device-up IFACE=lo)
stop on runlevel [016]

respawn
respawn limit 10 5

pre-start script
        [ -x /usr/sbin/nginx ] || { stop; exit 0; }
        [ -f /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ] || { stop; exit 0; }
end script

exec /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

```

**Explanation:**

- **`start on (filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=lo)`:** Specifies the conditions under which Nginx should start. In this case, it starts when the filesystem is mounted and the loopback network interface is up.
- **`stop on runlevel [016]`:** Specifies when Nginx should stop (runlevels 0, 1, and 6 correspond to halt, single-user mode, and reboot, respectively).
- **`respawn`:** Tells Upstart to restart Nginx if it crashes.
- **`respawn limit 10 5`:** Limits the respawn attempts to 10 times in 5 seconds to prevent infinite loops.
- **`exec /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:** Specifies the command to execute to start Nginx, including the path to the configuration file.

**Step 3: Restart Upstart to Apply Changes**

If you modified the file, restart Upstart:

```plaintext
sudo initctl reload-configuration
```

**Step 4: Start Nginx**

Start Nginx with:

```plaintext
sudo service nginx start
```

**Step 5: Verify Automatic Startup**

Reboot your system:

```plaintext
sudo reboot
```

After the reboot, verify that Nginx is running:

```plaintext
sudo service nginx status
```

If the status indicates that Nginx is running, the automatic startup is configured correctly.

## Method 3: Using SysVinit (For Very Old or Embedded Systems)

SysVinit is the oldest and least common initialization system for modern Linux distributions. If you are using it, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Locate the Init Script**

Nginx's SysVinit script is typically located in `/etc/init.d/nginx`.

**Step 2: Check the Script Contents**

Ensure the script exists and contains logic to start, stop, and restart Nginx. A typical script includes functions like `start()`, `stop()`, `restart()`, and `status()`. Here's a simplified example:

```plaintext
#!/bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          nginx
# Required-Start:    $network $remote_fs $local_fs
# Required-Stop:     $network $remote_fs $local_fs
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: starts the nginx web server
# Description:       starts nginx using start-stop-daemon
### END INIT INFO

PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
NAME=nginx
DESC="nginx web server"
DAEMON=/usr/sbin/nginx
CONFIGFILE=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
PIDFILE=/run/nginx.pid

test -x $DAEMON || exit 0

. /lib/lsb/init-functions

case "$1" in
  start)
        log_daemon_msg "Starting $DESC" "$NAME"
        if start-stop-daemon --start --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON -- -c $CONFIGFILE; then
                log_end_msg 0
        else
                log_end_msg 1
        fi
        ;;
  stop)
        log_daemon_msg "Stopping $DESC" "$NAME"
        if start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile $PIDFILE --retry 5; then
                log_end_msg 0
        else
                log_end_msg 1
        fi
        ;;
  restart|force-reload)
        log_daemon_msg "Restarting $DESC" "$NAME"
        start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile $PIDFILE --retry 5
        if start-stop-daemon --start --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON -- -c $CONFIGFILE; then
                log_end_msg 0
        else
                log_end_msg 1
        fi
        ;;
  status)
        status_of_proc "$DAEMON" "$NAME" && exit 0 || exit 1
        ;;
  *)
        echo "Usage: $NAME {start|stop|restart|force-reload|status}" >&2
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

exit 0
```

**Explanation:**

- **`### BEGIN INIT INFO ... ### END INIT INFO`:** Provides metadata about the script, including dependencies, startup runlevels (2, 3, 4, 5), and shutdown runlevels (0, 1, 6).
- **`start)`:** The `start` section contains the commands to start Nginx. It typically uses `start-stop-daemon` to manage the process.
- **`stop)`:** The `stop` section contains the commands to stop Nginx.
- **`restart)`:** The `restart` section contains the commands to restart Nginx.
- **`status)`:** The `status` section checks the status of Nginx process.

**Step 3: Make the Script Executable**

Ensure the script has execute permissions:

```plaintext
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
```

**Step 4: Enable Automatic Startup (using `update-rc.d` or `chkconfig`)**

The method for enabling automatic startup depends on your distribution. On Debian-based systems, use `update-rc.d`:

```plaintext
sudo update-rc.d nginx defaults
```

On Red Hat-based systems (older versions), use `chkconfig`:

```plaintext
sudo chkconfig nginx on
```

**Step 5: Verify Automatic Startup**

Reboot your system:

```plaintext
sudo reboot
```

After the reboot, check if Nginx is running:

```plaintext
sudo service nginx status
```

or

```plaintext
/etc/init.d/nginx status
```

If the status indicates that Nginx is running, the automatic startup is configured correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Systemd: "Failed to start nginx.service: Unit not found."** This typically means that the `nginx.service` file is not located in the correct directory (`/lib/systemd/system/` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`). Ensure the file exists in one of these locations and is correctly configured.
- **Nginx fails to start after reboot:** Check the Nginx error logs (usually located in `/var/log/nginx/error.log`) for any error messages that might indicate the cause of the problem. Common issues include incorrect configuration files, permission problems, or missing dependencies.
- **Upstart: Nginx not starting on boot:** Double-check the contents of `/etc/init/nginx.conf` and ensure that the `start on` condition is appropriate for your system. Also, verify that the Nginx executable is located at the path specified in the `exec` line.
- **SysVinit: Runlevels not configured correctly:** Examine the `### BEGIN INIT INFO` section of the init script (`/etc/init.d/nginx`) and verify that the `Default-Start` and `Default-Stop` lines are set correctly for your system.

## Conclusion

By following the appropriate method for your Linux distribution's initialization system (Systemd, Upstart, or SysVinit), you can ensure that Nginx starts automatically on boot, providing a reliable and uninterrupted web service. Always remember to test your configuration thoroughly after making changes and to consult the Nginx documentation and your distribution's documentation for more detailed information. Good luck!
