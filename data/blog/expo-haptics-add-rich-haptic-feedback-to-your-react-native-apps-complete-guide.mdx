# Expo Haptics: Add Rich Haptic Feedback to Your React Native Apps (Complete Guide)

Haptic feedback, the sense of touch in user interfaces, can significantly enhance the user experience in mobile applications. It provides subtle cues, confirms actions, and adds a layer of immersion that visuals and audio alone can't achieve. With Expo Haptics, integrating haptic feedback into your React Native apps becomes remarkably simple and cross-platform. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to leverage the power of haptics in your projects.

## What is Expo Haptics?

Expo Haptics is a module within the Expo framework that allows you to trigger different types of haptic feedback on iOS and Android devices. It provides a simple and consistent API, abstracting away the platform-specific complexities of haptic engine implementations. This means you can write your haptic logic once and have it work seamlessly on both platforms.

## Why Use Haptics in Your App?

Integrating haptics can dramatically improve your application in several key ways:

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Subtle vibrations can make interactions feel more responsive and satisfying. For example, a tap confirmation or a successful form submission becomes more engaging.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Haptics can provide feedback to users with visual impairments, making the app more accessible.
- **Increased Immersion:** For games and interactive experiences, haptics can add a crucial layer of realism and immersion. Think about feeling the impact of a virtual collision or the click of a virtual button.
- **Confirmation and Feedback:** Haptics can provide clear confirmation of actions, reducing ambiguity and improving usability. A slight bump when a setting is toggled, for instance.

## Getting Started with Expo Haptics

Before you start using Expo Haptics, you need to have an Expo project set up. If you don't have one, you can quickly create a new project using the Expo CLI:

```plaintext
npx create-expo-app my-haptic-app
cd my-haptic-app
```

Next, install the `expo-haptics` package:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-haptics
```

Now you're ready to import the `Haptics` module and start adding haptic feedback to your app!

```javascript
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'
```

## Basic Haptic Patterns

Expo Haptics provides several predefined haptic patterns that you can use to quickly add common types of feedback.

### 1. Notification Feedback

The `Haptics.notificationAsync()` function provides feedback suitable for notifications. It accepts a `Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType` enum that allows you to specify the type of notification:

- `Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success`: Indicates a successful operation.
- `Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Warning`: Indicates a warning or potential issue.
- `Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Error`: Indicates an error or failure.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Button, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'

export default function App() {
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Success)
  }

  const handleWarning = () => {
    Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Warning)
  }

  const handleError = () => {
    Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Error)
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Success" onPress={handleSuccess} />
      <Button title="Warning" onPress={handleWarning} />
      <Button title="Error" onPress={handleError} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'space-around',
  },
})
```

This example creates three buttons that trigger different types of notification feedback when pressed.

### 2. Impact Feedback

The `Haptics.impactAsync()` function provides feedback suitable for impacts. It accepts a `Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle` enum that allows you to specify the intensity of the impact:

- `Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light`: A subtle impact.
- `Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium`: A moderate impact.
- `Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Heavy`: A strong impact.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Button, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'

export default function App() {
  const handleLightImpact = () => {
    Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light)
  }

  const handleMediumImpact = () => {
    Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium)
  }

  const handleHeavyImpact = () => {
    Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Heavy)
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Light Impact" onPress={handleLightImpact} />
      <Button title="Medium Impact" onPress={handleMediumImpact} />
      <Button title="Heavy Impact" onPress={handleHeavyImpact} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'space-around',
  },
})
```

This example provides buttons that trigger different levels of impact feedback.

### 3. Selection Feedback

The `Haptics.selectionAsync()` function provides feedback suitable for selection changes, like scrolling through a list or adjusting a slider.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Button, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'

export default function App() {
  const handleSelection = () => {
    Haptics.selectionAsync()
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Selection" onPress={handleSelection} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

This example provides a simple button that triggers the selection feedback. Imagine attaching this to a slider or list scroll event for a richer experience.

## Advanced Haptics: Controlling Vibration Patterns (Android Only)

On Android, Expo Haptics allows for more granular control over haptic feedback using vibration patterns. The `Haptics.vibrateAsync()` function lets you define custom vibration patterns with specific durations and pauses. This level of customization is not available on iOS due to platform limitations.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Button, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'
import { Platform } from 'react-native'

export default function App() {
  const handleCustomVibration = () => {
    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      // Define a vibration pattern: vibrate for 100ms, pause for 50ms, vibrate for 200ms
      const pattern = [100, 50, 200]
      Haptics.vibrateAsync(pattern)
    } else {
      // Fallback for iOS (using a simple impact)
      Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium)
      console.log(
        'Custom vibration patterns are only supported on Android.  Using fallback on iOS.'
      )
    }
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Custom Vibration" onPress={handleCustomVibration} />
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
})
```

In this example, the `vibrateAsync()` function is used to create a custom vibration pattern. The `pattern` array defines the durations (in milliseconds) of vibrations and pauses. This provides precise control over the tactile feedback. It's important to include a platform check so that the app behaves gracefully on iOS, where the `vibrateAsync` pattern functionality is not available.

**Important:** Overusing custom vibration patterns can be disruptive to the user. Use them sparingly and thoughtfully to enhance the user experience, not to annoy them.

## Considerations for Haptic Implementation

- **Accessibility:** Always consider users with disabilities. Provide alternative ways to access information if haptic feedback is crucial. Don't rely _solely_ on haptics as a primary method of communication.
- **Platform Differences:** Haptic capabilities and implementations vary between iOS and Android. Test your haptic feedback on both platforms to ensure a consistent experience.
- **User Preferences:** Ideally, provide users with options to control the intensity or disable haptic feedback altogether within your app's settings.
- **Subtlety is Key:** Use haptics sparingly and purposefully. Too much haptic feedback can be distracting and annoying.
- **Battery Consumption:** Excessive use of haptics can drain the device's battery. Optimize your haptic implementations to minimize power consumption.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your haptic feedback on a variety of devices to ensure it feels appropriate and consistent across different hardware.

## Common Use Cases for Expo Haptics

Here are some common scenarios where you can effectively use Expo Haptics:

- **Button Presses:** Provide a subtle haptic tap when a button is pressed.
- **Form Submissions:** Confirm a successful form submission with a success notification.
- **Error Messages:** Alert users to errors with a warning or error notification.
- **List Interactions:** Provide haptic feedback when scrolling through a list or selecting an item.
- **Game Interactions:** Enhance game immersion with impact feedback for collisions, explosions, and other events.
- **Slider Adjustments:** Provide haptic clicks when adjusting slider values.
- **Toggle Switches:** Add a distinct haptic bump when toggling a setting.
- **Loading Indicators:** Provide a subtle pulsing vibration while loading content.
- **Drag and Drop:** Indicate the start and end of a drag-and-drop operation.

## Conclusion
