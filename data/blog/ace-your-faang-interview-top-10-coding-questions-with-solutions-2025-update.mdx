# Ace Your FAANG Interview: Top 10 Coding Questions with Solutions (2025 Update)

Landing a job at a FAANG company (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) is a dream for many software engineers. These companies are known for their challenging coding interviews, which require a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. This post will guide you through the top 10 most frequently asked coding questions in FAANG interviews, along with detailed explanations and code examples in JavaScript. Remember to adapt the logic and principles to your preferred programming language.

## Why FAANG Interviews Are So Tough

FAANG companies use coding interviews to assess candidates on:

*   **Problem-solving skills:** Can you break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts?
*   **Algorithm and Data Structure Knowledge:** Do you understand common algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal) and data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables)?
*   **Code Quality:** Can you write clean, efficient, and well-documented code?
*   **Communication Skills:** Can you clearly explain your thought process and solution?
*   **Analytical Thinking:** Can you analyze the time and space complexity of your solution?

## Top 10 FAANG Coding Interview Questions

Here's a curated list of the top 10 coding interview questions often asked at FAANG companies, along with explanations and JavaScript code examples.

### 1. Two Sum

**Problem:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to* `target`. You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

`nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`

`Output: [0, 1]` (because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`)

**Solution:**  Using a Hash Map (Dictionary) to store encountered numbers and their indices.

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const numMap = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }
  return null; // No solution found (shouldn't happen according to the problem constraints)
}

const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `numMap` stores each number in `nums` as a key and its index as the value.
*   For each number, we calculate the `complement` needed to reach the `target`.
*   We check if the `complement` already exists in the `numMap`. If it does, we've found our two numbers and return their indices.
*   If the `complement` is not found, we add the current number and its index to the `numMap`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, we store all the numbers in the `numMap`.

### 2. Valid Parentheses

**Problem:** Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.  An input string is valid if:

1.  Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2.  Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3.  Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example:**

`s = "()[]{}"`

`Output: true`

`s = "(]"`

`Output: false`

**Solution:** Use a Stack to track open brackets.

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
  const stack = [];
  const bracketMap = {
    ')': '(',
    '}': '{',
    ']': '['
  };

  for (let char of s) {
    if (char === '(' || char === '{' || char === '[') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ')' || char === '}' || char === ']') {
      if (stack.length === 0 || stack.pop() !== bracketMap[char]) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return stack.length === 0; // True if stack is empty at the end
}

console.log(isValid("()[]{}")); // Output: true
console.log(isValid("(]")); // Output: false
console.log(isValid("([)]")); // Output: false
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use a `stack` to keep track of open brackets.
*   When we encounter an open bracket, we push it onto the stack.
*   When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If either of these conditions is false, the string is invalid.
*   After processing the entire string, if the stack is empty, the string is valid.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the string once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, we push all the opening brackets onto the stack.

### 3. Reverse Linked List

**Problem:** Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Example:**

`Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL`

`Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL`

**Solution:** Iterative Approach

```javascript
function reverseList(head) {
  let prev = null;
  let current = head;
  let next = null;

  while (current != null) {
    next = current.next;
    current.next = prev;
    prev = current;
    current = next;
  }
  return prev; // prev is the new head
}

// Helper function to create a linked list (for testing)
function createLinkedList(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return null;
  let head = { val: arr[0], next: null };
  let current = head;
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    current.next = { val: arr[i], next: null };
    current = current.next;
  }
  return head;
}

// Helper function to print a linked list (for testing)
function printLinkedList(head) {
  let current = head;
  let result = "";
  while (current != null) {
    result += current.val + " -> ";
    current = current.next;
  }
  result += "NULL";
  console.log(result);
}


let head = createLinkedList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log("Original Linked List:");
printLinkedList(head);

let reversedHead = reverseList(head);
console.log("Reversed Linked List:");
printLinkedList(reversedHead);
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next`.
*   We iterate through the linked list, reversing the `next` pointer of each node to point to the `prev` node.
*   We update the `prev`, `current`, and `next` pointers accordingly.
*   Finally, `prev` will be the new head of the reversed linked list.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the linked list once.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space.

### 4. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

**Problem:** Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example:**

```
     1
      \
       2
      /
     3

Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

**Solution:** Recursive Approach

```javascript
function inorderTraversal(root) {
  const result = [];

  function traverse(node) {
    if (node) {
      traverse(node.left);
      result.push(node.val);
      traverse(node.right);
    }
  }

  traverse(root);
  return result;
}

// Helper function to create a binary tree node (for testing)
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
  this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
  this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
  this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
}

// Create a sample tree
const root = new TreeNode(1, null, new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(3)));

console.log(inorderTraversal(root)); // Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

**Explanation:**

*   Inorder traversal visits the left subtree, then the current node, then the right subtree.
*   The recursive function `traverse` performs this traversal.  The base case is when the node is null.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We visit each node in the tree once.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case (skewed tree), the recursion stack can have a depth of n.

### 5. Merge Intervals

**Problem:** Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

**Example:**

`intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

`Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`

**Solution:**

```javascript
function merge(intervals) {
  if (!intervals || intervals.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  // Sort intervals by starting time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  const merged = [];
  let currentInterval = intervals[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const nextInterval = intervals[i];

    // Check for overlap
    if (nextInterval[0] <= currentInterval[1]) {
      // Merge the intervals
      currentInterval[1] = Math.max(currentInterval[1], nextInterval[1]);
    } else {
      // No overlap, add the current interval to the merged list
      merged.push(currentInterval);
      currentInterval = nextInterval;
    }
  }

  // Add the last interval
  merged.push(currentInterval);

  return merged;
}

const intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]];
console.log(merge(intervals)); // Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

**Explanation:**

*   First, we sort the intervals by their start times.  This is crucial.
*   We iterate through the sorted intervals, keeping track of the `currentInterval`.
*   If the next interval overlaps with the `currentInterval` (i.e., its start time is less than or equal to the `currentInterval`'s end time), we merge them by updating the `currentInterval`'s end time to be the maximum of the two end times.
*   If the next interval does not overlap, we add the `currentInterval` to the `merged` list and update the `currentInterval` to be the next interval.
*   Finally, we add the last `currentInterval` to the `merged` list.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Dominated by the sorting step.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, the `merged` list can contain all the intervals.  O(log n) if the sorting algorithm uses that much space.

### 6.  Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

**Problem:** Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A *subsequence* of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

*   For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A *common subsequence* of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example:**

`text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"`

`Output: 3` (The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.)

**Solution:**  Dynamic Programming

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2) {
  const m = text1.length;
  const n = text2.length;

  // Create a 2D array to store lengths of LCS of prefixes
  const dp = Array(m + 1).fill(null).map(() => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

  // Build the dp table in bottom-up manner
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[m][n];
}

const text1 = "abcde";
const text2 = "ace";
console.log(longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2)); // Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**

*   We create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the LCS of `text1[0...i-1]` and `text2[0...j-1]`.
*   We iterate through the strings, filling the `dp` array.
*   If the characters `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]` are equal, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`. This means we extend the LCS by one.
*   Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.  This means we take the best LCS from either ignoring the last character of `text1` or ignoring the last character of `text2`.
*   Finally, `dp[m][n]` contains the length of the LCS of `text1` and `text2`.

**Time Complexity:** O(m\*n) - We iterate through the 2D array.
**Space Complexity:** O(m\*n) -  We use a 2D array of size (m+1) x (n+1).

### 7.  Implement a Queue using Two Stacks

**Problem:** Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

**Solution:**

```javascript
class MyQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.stack1 = []; // For enqueueing
    this.stack2 = []; // For dequeueing
  }

  push(x) {
    this.stack1.push(x);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.stack2.length === 0) {
      // Transfer elements from stack1 to stack2
      while (this.stack1.length > 0) {
        this.stack2.push(this.stack1.pop());
      }
    }
    if (this.stack2.length === 0) {
      return null; // Queue is empty
    }
    return this.stack2.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    if (this.stack2.length === 0) {
      // Transfer elements from stack1 to stack2
      while (this.stack1.length > 0) {
        this.stack2.push(this.stack1.pop());
      }
    }
    if (this.stack2.length === 0) {
      return null; // Queue is empty
    }
    return this.stack2[this.stack2.length - 1];
  }

  empty() {
    return this.stack1.length === 0 && this.stack2.length === 0;
  }
}

// Example Usage:
const myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1);
myQueue.push(2);
console.log(myQueue.peek()); // Output: 1
console.log(myQueue.pop()); // Output: 1
console.log(myQueue.empty()); // Output: false
```

**Explanation:**

*   We use two stacks: `stack1` for pushing (enqueueing) and `stack2` for popping (dequeueing) and peeking.
*   `push(x)`: Simply pushes the element `x` onto `stack1`.
*   `pop()`:
    *   If `stack2` is empty, we transfer all elements from `stack1` to `stack2` by popping from `stack1` and pushing onto `stack2`. This reverses the order of the elements, effectively making the bottom of `stack1` (the oldest element) the top of `stack2`.
    *   Then, we pop the top element from `stack2`, which is the element that was first enqueued.
*   `peek()`:  Similar to `pop()`, we transfer elements from `stack1` to `stack2` if `stack2` is empty. Then, we peek at the top element of `stack2` (without popping it).
*   `empty()`: Returns `true` if both stacks are empty, and `false` otherwise.

**Time Complexity:**

*   `push()`: O(1)
*   `pop()`: Amortized O(1). In the worst case (when `stack2` is empty and we need to transfer elements), it's O(n), but this happens relatively infrequently.
*   `peek()`: Amortized O(1), similar to `pop()`.
*   `empty()`: O(1)

**Space Complexity:** O(n) - We store all the elements in the two stacks.

### 8.  Find the Kth Largest Element in an Array

**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`th largest element in the array.

Note that it is the `k`th largest element in the sorted order, not the `k`th distinct element.

**Example:**

`nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2`

`Output: 5`

**Solution:** Using QuickSelect Algorithm (efficient)

```javascript
function findKthLargest(nums, k) {
  // Convert k to find the (n - k + 1)-th smallest element
  return quickSelect(nums, 0, nums.length - 1, nums.length - k);
}

function quickSelect(nums, left, right, k) {
  if (left === right) {
    return nums[left];
  }

  const pivotIndex = partition(nums, left, right);

  if (k === pivotIndex) {
    return nums[k];
  } else if (k < pivotIndex) {
    return quickSelect(nums, left, pivotIndex - 1, k);
  } else {
    return quickSelect(nums, pivotIndex + 1, right, k);
  }
}

function partition(nums, left, right) {
  const pivot = nums[right];
  let i = left; // Index of smaller element

  for (let j = left; j < right; j++) {
    if (nums[j] <= pivot) {
      // Swap nums[i] and nums[j]
      [nums[i], nums[j]] = [nums[j], nums[i]];
      i++;
    }
  }

  // Swap nums[i] and nums[right] (pivot)
  [nums[i], nums[right]] = [nums[right], nums[i]];

  return i; // Return index of pivot
}


const nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4];
const k = 2;
console.log(findKthLargest(nums, k)); // Output: 5
```

**Explanation:**

*   **QuickSelect Algorithm:** This is a modification of the QuickSort algorithm.  Instead of sorting the entire array, it partitions the array around a pivot and recursively calls itself on only one of the partitions (the one that contains the kth smallest element).
*   **`partition(nums, left, right)`:** This function partitions the array from `left` to `right` around a pivot element (chosen as the last element in this implementation).  It rearranges the array such that all elements less than or equal to the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it. It returns the index of the pivot.
*   **`quickSelect(nums, left, right, k)`:** This function recursively searches for the kth smallest element.  It partitions the array and checks if the pivot index is equal to `k`.  If it is, the pivot element is the kth smallest.  If `k` is less than the pivot index, the kth smallest element is in the left partition.  Otherwise, it's in the right partition.
*   **`findKthLargest(nums, k)`:**  Since we're looking for the kth *largest* element, we convert `k` to find the corresponding index for the (n - k)-th *smallest* element and call `quickSelect` on that index. (Technically it should be `n - k` if k is zero based, so `n-k+1` should be `n-k`).

**Time Complexity:** Average case: O(n), Worst case: O(n^2) (but can be avoided with randomized pivot selection).
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - In-place algorithm. O(log n) due to recursion stack (average case).

### 9.  Product of Array Except Self

**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`. The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time without using the division operation.

**Example:**

`nums = [1,2,3,4]`

`Output: [24,12,8,6]`

**Solution:**

```javascript
function productExceptSelf(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const result = new Array(n).fill(1);

  // Calculate prefix products
  let prefix = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result[i] = prefix;
    prefix *= nums[i];
  }

  // Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix products
  let suffix = 1;
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    result[i] *= suffix;
    suffix *= nums[i];
  }

  return result;
}

const nums = [1,2,3,4];
console.log(productExceptSelf(nums)); // Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

**Explanation:**

*   We create an array `result` of the same length as `nums`, initialized with all elements set to 1.
*   **Prefix Products:** We iterate through the `nums` array, calculating the product of all elements *before* the current element and store it in `result[i]`.  So, `result[i]` will hold the product of `nums[0] * nums[1] * ... * nums[i-1]`.
*   **Suffix Products:** We then iterate through the `nums` array in reverse order, calculating the product of all elements *after* the current element. We multiply this suffix product with the existing `result[i]` (which already contains the prefix product) to get the desired product of all elements except `nums[i]`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array twice.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) -  We use the output array `result` which is not considered extra space for the purpose of this problem. However technically it is O(n).

### 10.  Meeting Rooms II

**Problem:** Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...]` (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Example:**

`intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`

`Output: 2`

**Solution:**  Using Priority Queue (Min Heap)

```javascript
function minMeetingRooms(intervals) {
  if (!intervals || intervals.length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Sort the intervals by start time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  // Use a min-heap to track the end times of ongoing meetings
  const minHeap = []; // Stores the *end* times of ongoing meetings

  // Iterate through the intervals
  for (const interval of intervals) {
    // If the earliest ending meeting has ended, remove it from the heap
    if (minHeap.length > 0 && interval[0] >= minHeap[0]) {
      minHeap.shift(); // Removes the smallest (earliest ending) element
    }

    // Add the current meeting's end time to the heap
    minHeap.push(interval[1]);

    // Re-heapify (maintain min-heap property) - In Javascript, we'll use sort for simplicity.
    minHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  }

  // The size of the heap is the minimum number of rooms needed
  return minHeap.length;
}

const intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]];
console.log(minMeetingRooms(intervals)); // Output: 2
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Sort by Start Time:** First, sort the intervals based on their start times. This allows us to process meetings in the order they begin.
*   **Min-Heap for End Times:** We use a min-heap (priority queue) to store the end times of the meetings that are currently in progress. The min-heap allows us to quickly find the meeting that ends earliest.
*   **Iterate and Check for Overlap:**  For each interval:
    *   If the start time of the current meeting is greater than or equal to the earliest ending meeting (the root of the min-heap), it means we can reuse a room. We remove the earliest ending meeting from the heap.
    *   We then add the end time of the current meeting to the heap.
    *   We re-heapify (sort in ascending order using `.sort((a, b) => a - b)`) to maintain the min-heap property.
*   **Heap Size is the Answer:** The final size of the min-heap represents the minimum number of conference rooms required.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Dominated by sorting the intervals and the heap operations. Although `shift` is O(n) in the worst case for standard Javascript arrays it is used in combination with `sort` which has overall complexity of O(n log n)
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, all meetings might be overlapping, and the min-heap will store the end times of all n meetings.
