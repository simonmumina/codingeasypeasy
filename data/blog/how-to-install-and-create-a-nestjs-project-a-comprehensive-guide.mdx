# How to Install and Create a NestJS Project: A Comprehensive Guide

NestJS is a powerful and progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. Built with TypeScript (and also available in pure JavaScript), NestJS combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming). If you're looking to dive into building robust and maintainable backend systems, NestJS is an excellent choice. This guide will walk you through the process of installing NestJS and creating a new project using the NestJS CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** NestJS requires Node.js to run. It's recommended to use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version. You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is installed automatically when you install Node.js. You can verify the installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal. If you prefer using Yarn or pnpm, NestJS supports those as well.
- **A Code Editor:** Choose your favorite code editor. Visual Studio Code is a popular and highly recommended option due to its excellent TypeScript support.

## Step 1: Installing the NestJS CLI (Command Line Interface)

The NestJS CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating, building, and managing NestJS projects. It provides a scaffolding mechanism to generate boilerplate code and perform common tasks.

To install the NestJS CLI globally, open your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Let's break down this command:

- `npm`: Calls the Node Package Manager.
- `i`: Shorthand for `install`.
- `-g`: Specifies a global installation, making the CLI available from any directory in your terminal.
- `@nestjs/cli`: Specifies the NestJS CLI package to install.

After the installation completes, verify that the CLI is installed correctly by running:

```plaintext
nest -v
```

This command should display the version number of the installed NestJS CLI.

## Step 2: Creating a New NestJS Project

Now that the NestJS CLI is installed, you can use it to create a new project. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project in your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
nest new my-nest-project
```

Replace `my-nest-project` with the desired name for your project.

This command will:

1.  Ask you to choose a package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm). Select your preferred package manager.
2.  Create a new directory with the name you specified.
3.  Initialize a new NestJS project inside the directory with a basic project structure.
4.  Install the necessary dependencies.

```
? Which package manager would you like to use? npm
✨  Successfully created project my-nest-project
```

Once the process is complete, you'll have a fully functional NestJS project ready to go.

## Step 3: Exploring the Project Structure

Let's take a look at the basic project structure created by the NestJS CLI:

```
my-nest-project/
├── src/
│   ├── app.controller.ts
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── app.service.ts
│   └── main.ts
├── test/
│   └── app.e2e-spec.ts
│   └── app.spec.ts
├── nest-cli.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.build.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock (or package-lock.json)
```

Here's a brief overview of the key files and directories:

- **`src/`:** This directory contains the source code for your application.
  - `app.controller.ts`: Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate service.
  - `app.module.ts`: Defines the root module of your application. Modules are used to organize related components.
  - `app.service.ts`: Contains the business logic of your application.
  - `main.ts`: The entry point of your application. It creates and starts the NestJS application.
- **`test/`:** This directory contains unit and end-to-end tests for your application.
- **`nest-cli.json`:** Configuration file for the NestJS CLI.
- **`package.json`:** Contains the project's metadata and dependencies.
- **`tsconfig.json`:** TypeScript configuration file.

## Step 4: Running the Application

To start the development server, navigate to your project directory in the terminal:

```plaintext
cd my-nest-project
```

And then run the following command:

```plaintext
npm run start:dev
```

This command will compile your TypeScript code and start the NestJS development server. The `--watch` flag in the `start:dev` script enables automatic recompilation whenever you make changes to your code.

You should see output similar to this:

```
[Nest] 8476   - 10/26/2024, 12:00:00 AM   [NestFactory] Starting Nest application...
[Nest] 8476   - 10/26/2024, 12:00:00 AM   [InstanceLoader] AppModule dependencies initialized +59ms
[Nest] 8476   - 10/26/2024, 12:00:00 AM   [RoutesResolver] AppController {/}: +10ms
[Nest] 8476   - 10/26/2024, 12:00:00 AM   [RouterExplorer] Mapped {/, GET} route +1ms
[Nest] 8476   - 10/26/2024, 12:00:00 AM   [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started +5ms
```

By default, the application will be running on port `3000`. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see "Hello World!" displayed. This is the default response from the `AppController`.

## Code Example: Modifying the Controller

Let's modify the `AppController` to return a different message. Open `src/app.controller.ts` and change the `getHello()` method:

```plaintext
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import { AppService } from './app.service'

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.getHello()
  }
}
```

Now, open `src/app.service.ts` and modify the `getHello()` method to return a different message, for instance "Welcome to NestJS!":

```plaintext
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Welcome to NestJS!'
  }
}
```

Save both files. The development server will automatically recompile the code. Refresh your browser, and you should see the updated message "Welcome to NestJS!".

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully installed NestJS and created a new project. Here are some suggestions for next steps:

- **Explore the NestJS Documentation:** The official NestJS documentation is a valuable resource for learning more about the framework: [https://docs.nestjs.com/](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
- **Learn about Modules, Controllers, and Services:** Understand the core concepts of NestJS, including modules, controllers, and services.
- **Implement a Simple API:** Try building a simple API endpoint to retrieve data from a database or external source.
- **Explore Dependency Injection:** Master dependency injection, a fundamental concept in NestJS.
- **Experiment with Middleware and Interceptors:** Learn how to use middleware and interceptors to enhance your application's functionality.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided a step-by-step walkthrough of installing NestJS and creating a new project. With the NestJS CLI, setting up a new project is incredibly simple. From here, you can build upon this foundation to create complex and scalable server-side applications. Happy coding!
