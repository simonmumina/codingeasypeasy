# Using Express.js with Deno: A Comprehensive Guide

While Deno comes with its own built-in HTTP server and routing capabilities, you might find yourself wanting to leverage the familiarity and extensive middleware ecosystem of Express.js.  This guide will walk you through integrating Express.js into your Deno project, covering setup, routing, middleware, and best practices.  We'll explore how to bridge the gap between these two powerful technologies.

## Why Use Express.js with Deno?

Deno offers a modern approach to JavaScript and TypeScript development, focusing on security and developer experience. However, Express.js has been a mainstay in the Node.js world for years, boasting a vast community, a rich middleware library, and widespread familiarity.

Here's why you might consider using Express.js with Deno:

*   **Familiarity:** If you have existing Express.js experience, the learning curve will be significantly reduced.
*   **Middleware Ecosystem:** Express.js has a massive library of middleware for various tasks, like authentication, logging, and security. While Deno's ecosystem is growing, it doesn't yet match the maturity of Express.js.
*   **Simplified Routing:** Express.js provides a clear and concise way to define routes, making your application structure more organized and maintainable.
*   **Easier Migration:**  If you're migrating a Node.js application to Deno, using Express.js can help you maintain a familiar structure and minimize code changes.

However, it's crucial to understand the trade-offs:

*   **Added Dependency:** You're adding an external dependency, increasing the project size and potentially introducing new vulnerabilities.
*   **Not Fully Native:** You won't be taking full advantage of Deno's native HTTP server and performance optimizations.  There's a translation layer involved.
*   **Potential Conflicts:**  Managing Deno's permission model and Express.js middleware can sometimes introduce complexities.

## Setting Up Your Deno Project with Express.js

Let's start by setting up a basic Deno project and installing the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Create a Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    mkdir deno-express
    cd deno-express
    ```

2.  **Create a `deps.ts` File:**

    This file will manage our dependencies.  We'll use it to import Express.js and other necessary modules.

    ```typescript filename="deps.ts"
    export { Application, Router } from 'https://deno.land/x/oak@v12.6.1/mod.ts'; // Use Oak for HTTP Server (more Deno native)
    export { default as express } from 'npm:express@4.18.2'; // Use express
    export type { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'npm:@types/express@4.17.21'; // Types for Express

    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   **Oak:**  Instead of relying *solely* on Express for the HTTP server, we're using Oak.  Oak is a middleware framework built specifically for Deno, closely mirroring the structure of Koa (which itself inspired Express).  This allows us to integrate Express middleware while retaining a more Deno-friendly foundation.  This improves integration and performance.  We export `Application` and `Router` from Oak.
    *   **`npm:express@4.18.2`:** This imports the Express.js library from the npm registry.  Deno allows you to directly import packages from npm.
    *   **`npm:@types/express@4.17.21`:** This imports the TypeScript type definitions for Express.js.  This is essential for type safety and autocompletion in your code.  We also export the `Request`, `Response`, and `NextFunction` types for easy access.

3.  **Create an `app.ts` File (Your Main Application):**

    ```typescript filename="app.ts"
    import { Application, Router, express, Request, Response, NextFunction } from './deps.ts';

    const app = new Application();
    const router = new Router();
    const expressApp = express();

    // Middleware:  Oak Logger
    app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
        console.log(`Request received: ${ctx.request.method} ${ctx.request.url}`);
        await next();
    });


    // Integrate Express Middleware
    function expressMiddleware(
        req: Request,
        res: Response,
        next: NextFunction
    ): Promise<void> {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            expressApp(req, res, () => {
                next();
                resolve();
            });
        });
    }

    app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
        const req = ctx.request.original; // Get the original request object
        const res = ctx.response.original; // Get the original response object

        if (req && res) {
            await expressMiddleware(req, res, next);
        } else {
            ctx.response.status = 500;
            ctx.response.body = "Error: Could not access original request/response objects.";
        }
    });


    // Define an Express route
    expressApp.get('/express', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello from Express!');
    });

    // Oak Routes (Deno Native)
    router.get('/deno', (ctx) => {
        ctx.response.body = 'Hello from Deno (Oak)!';
    });

    // Register Oak router
    app.use(router.routes());
    app.use(router.allowedMethods());

    // Start the server
    const port = 8000;
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
    await app.listen({ port });

    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   **Imports:**  Imports necessary modules from `deps.ts`.
    *   **Oak Application:** Creates a new Oak `Application` instance.  This is our main Deno HTTP server.
    *   **Oak Router:** Creates an Oak `Router` instance for defining Deno-native routes.
    *   **Express Application:** Creates a new Express.js application instance.
    *   **Oak Middleware:**  This is a simple example of Oak middleware that logs each incoming request.
    *   **`expressMiddleware` Function:** This crucial function adapts the Express.js middleware to work within the Oak framework.  It wraps the Express application call in a Promise, allowing it to be used with Oak's asynchronous middleware system.  It retrieves the original `req` and `res` objects from the Oak context. These are the standard Node.js `http.IncomingMessage` and `http.ServerResponse` objects that Express.js expects.  If these objects are not available, it returns an error.  The `next()` function passed to this middleware is Oak's `next()` function, which will continue processing the middleware chain.
    *   **Express Route:** Defines a simple Express.js route at `/express`.  This route will be handled by Express.js.
    *   **Oak Route:** Defines a simple Deno-native route at `/deno`.  This route will be handled by Oak.
    *   **Registering Routes and Starting the Server:** Registers the Oak router and starts the Deno server on port 8000.

4.  **Create a `deno.jsonc` File:**

    This file configures Deno's runtime environment.

    ```jsonc filename="deno.jsonc"
    {
      "imports": {
          "npm:": "https://esm.sh/"
      },
      "tasks": {
          "start": "deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env app.ts"
      },
      "compilerOptions": {
          "jsx": "react-jsx",
          "jsxImportSource": "react"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   **`imports`:**  Tells Deno where to resolve npm specifiers (packages). `https://esm.sh/` is a popular CDN for serving ES modules from npm.
    *   **`tasks`:** Defines a task named "start" that runs the `app.ts` file with the necessary permissions.
    *   **`--allow-net`:**  Allows the Deno process to listen on network ports (port 8000 in this case).
    *   **`--allow-read`:** Allows the Deno process to read files (if your application needs to read any configuration files, for example).
    *   **`--allow-env`:** Allows the Deno process to read environment variables.

5.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    deno task start
    ```

    This command will execute the `start` task defined in `deno.jsonc`, which will run your `app.ts` file.

6. **Test your server:**

Open your web browser to `http://localhost:8000/deno` to test the Deno (Oak) endpoint, and open `http://localhost:8000/express` to test the Express endpoint.

## Understanding the Integration

The key to integrating Express.js with Deno lies in the `expressMiddleware` function.  This function acts as a bridge, allowing Express.js middleware to be executed within the Deno/Oak context.

*   **`ctx.request.original` and `ctx.response.original`:**  Oak (and Koa) provide access to the underlying Node.js `http.IncomingMessage` and `http.ServerResponse` objects.  These are the objects that Express.js expects to receive.  By extracting them from the Oak context, we can pass them directly to Express.js middleware.
*   **The Promise Wrapper:**  Express.js middleware typically uses callbacks.  Deno favors asynchronous functions and Promises.  The `expressMiddleware` function wraps the Express.js middleware call in a Promise, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into Oak's asynchronous middleware chain. The `next()` function in the Promise resolve ensures that the next Oak middleware in the chain is called.
* **Error Handling:**  The `expressMiddleware` function includes a check to ensure that the original request and response objects are available. If they are not, it returns a 500 error. This is important because not all Oak contexts will have these objects available.

## Using Express.js Middleware

Now that you have a basic setup, let's explore how to use Express.js middleware in your Deno application.

```typescript filename="app.ts"
import { Application, Router, express, Request, Response, NextFunction } from './deps.ts';
import cors from 'npm:cors@2.8.5'; // Import CORS middleware

const app = new Application();
const router = new Router();
const expressApp = express();

// Oak Logger
app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
    console.log(`Request received: ${ctx.request.method} ${ctx.request.url}`);
    await next();
});

// Integrate Express Middleware
function expressMiddleware(
    req: Request,
    res: Response,
    next: NextFunction
): Promise<void> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        expressApp(req, res, () => {
            next();
            resolve();
        });
    });
}

// Enable CORS using Express middleware
expressApp.use(cors());

app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
    const req = ctx.request.original; // Get the original request object
    const res = ctx.response.original; // Get the original response object

    if (req && res) {
        await expressMiddleware(req, res, next);
    } else {
        ctx.response.status = 500;
        ctx.response.body = "Error: Could not access original request/response objects.";
    }
});

// Define an Express route with CORS enabled
expressApp.get('/express-cors', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express with CORS!' });
});

// Oak Routes (Deno Native)
router.get('/deno', (ctx) => {
    ctx.response.body = 'Hello from Deno (Oak)!';
});

// Register Oak router
app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());

// Start the server
const port = 8000;
console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
await app.listen({ port });

```

**Changes:**

1.  **Import CORS:**  We import the `cors` middleware from npm.
2.  **Enable CORS:**  We use `expressApp.use(cors())` to enable CORS for all Express.js routes.  You can customize the CORS options as needed.
3. **`express-cors` endpoint:** A new endpoint `/express-cors` is added to demonstrate the CORS middleware.

Now, requests from different origins will be allowed to access the `/express-cors` route.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Type Definitions:** Make sure you have the necessary type definitions installed for any Express.js middleware you use (e.g., `@types/cors`).
*   **Middleware Order:** The order in which you apply middleware is crucial.  Middleware is executed in the order it's added to the application.
*   **Compatibility:**  Not all Express.js middleware will be directly compatible with Deno.  You might need to adapt or find alternative solutions. Always test thoroughly.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using Express.js with Deno:

*   **Use Oak for Core Functionality:**  Leverage Oak for the core HTTP server and routing whenever possible.  This allows you to take advantage of Deno's native capabilities.
*   **Use Express.js for Specific Middleware:** Use Express.js only when you need specific middleware that is not readily available in the Deno ecosystem.
*   **Modularize Your Code:**  Break your application into smaller, reusable modules.  This will make your code easier to maintain and test.
*   **Type Checking:**  Use TypeScript and enable strict type checking.  This will help you catch errors early and improve the reliability of your application.
*   **Testing:**  Write comprehensive tests for your application.  This will help you ensure that your code is working as expected and prevent regressions.
*   **Security:**  Be mindful of security best practices.  Use appropriate middleware for authentication, authorization, and input validation.

## Conclusion

Integrating Express.js with Deno can be a useful approach when you need the familiarity and rich middleware ecosystem of Express.js. By using Oak as a foundation and implementing a middleware bridge, you can combine the strengths of both technologies. Remember to carefully consider the trade-offs and follow best practices to build robust and maintainable Deno applications with Express.js.  As the Deno ecosystem continues to grow, you might find yourself needing Express.js less and less, but for now, this integration provides a powerful option.
