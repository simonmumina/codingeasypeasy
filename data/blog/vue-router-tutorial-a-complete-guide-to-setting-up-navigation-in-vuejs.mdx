# Vue Router Tutorial: A Complete Guide to Setting Up Navigation in Vue.js

Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js, enabling you to build Single-Page Applications (SPAs) with client-side routing. This means users can navigate between different views or "pages" within your application without requiring a full page reload from the server, resulting in a smoother and faster user experience.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up Vue Router in your Vue.js application, covering everything from installation to advanced features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** These are required for managing your project dependencies.
*   **Vue.js installed:**  A basic understanding of Vue.js is essential. You can create a new Vue.js project using the Vue CLI:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @vue/cli
    vue create my-vue-app
    cd my-vue-app
    ```

## 1. Installing Vue Router

The first step is to install Vue Router as a dependency in your project.  Use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install vue-router@4
# or
yarn add vue-router@4
```

We are specifically installing version 4 of Vue Router, which is compatible with Vue 3. If you are using Vue 2, you need to install Vue Router version 3 (e.g., `npm install vue-router@3`).

## 2. Creating Router Configuration

Now, let's create a separate file, typically named `router/index.js` (or `router/index.ts` for TypeScript projects), to configure our routes.

```javascript
// router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';

// Import your components that will be rendered by the routes
import HomeView from '../components/HomeView.vue';
import AboutView from '../components/AboutView.vue';
import ContactView from '../components/ContactView.vue';

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeView
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: AboutView
  },
  {
    path: '/contact',
    name: 'contact',
    component: ContactView
  }
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(), // Use browser history mode (recommended for SPAs)
  routes // short for `routes: routes`
});

export default router;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`createRouter`:** This function creates a new router instance.
*   **`createWebHistory`:**  This creates a history object that uses the browser's history API for navigation. This provides clean URLs (e.g., `/about` instead of `/#/about`). You can also use `createWebHashHistory` which uses `#` in the URL (useful if you can't configure your server).
*   **`routes`:** This array defines your routes. Each route is an object with the following properties:
    *   **`path`:**  The URL path that the route matches.  `'/'` represents the root path.
    *   **`name`:**  An optional, but highly recommended, name for the route.  This makes it easier to link to the route in your templates.
    *   **`component`:** The Vue component to render when the route is matched.  Make sure you import your components at the top of the file.

**Important Note:** Make sure the paths are unique. Duplicate paths will lead to unpredictable routing behavior.

## 3. Integrating Vue Router into Your Application

Now, let's integrate the router into your main Vue application.  Open your `src/main.js` (or `src/main.ts`) file and import the router:

```javascript
// src/main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router'; // Import the router instance we created

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(router); // Tell Vue to use the router
app.mount('#app');
```

**Explanation:**

*   We import the `router` instance from the `router/index.js` file.
*   We use `app.use(router)` to register the router with the Vue application. This makes the router available to all components within the application.

## 4. Adding Navigation Links

To navigate between routes, you'll use the `<router-link>` component.  Open your `App.vue` file (or any other component where you want to create navigation links) and add the following:

```plaintext
<template>
  <nav>
    <router-link to="/" :class="{ active: $route.name === 'home' }">Home</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/about" :class="{ active: $route.name === 'about' }">About</router-link> |
    <router-link to="/contact" :class="{ active: $route.name === 'contact' }">Contact</router-link>
  </nav>

  <router-view />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'App'
}
</script>

<style scoped>
nav {
  padding: 30px;
}

nav a {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

nav a.active {
  color: #42b983;
}
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`<router-link>`:** This component is used to create links to different routes in your application.
    *   **`to`:**  This attribute specifies the path to navigate to.  You can use a string (e.g., `to="/about"`) or an object (see below for named routes).
    *   **`:class="{ active: $route.name === 'home' }"`:`** This is an example of conditionally applying a class based on the current route. When the route is 'home', the 'active' class will be added to the link.
*   **`<router-view>`:** This component is a placeholder where the routed components will be rendered. Vue Router will dynamically replace the content of `<router-view>` with the component that matches the current route.
*   **`$route`:** This is a Vue Router property that provides access to information about the current route, such as the `name` and `path`.

## 5. Using Named Routes

Using named routes is highly recommended because it makes your code more maintainable. Instead of relying on hardcoded paths, you can refer to routes by their names.  This is especially useful when the paths change.

To link to a named route, you can pass an object to the `to` attribute:

```vue
<router-link :to="{ name: 'about' }">About</router-link>
```

This is equivalent to `<router-link to="/about">` but more robust.  If you ever change the path associated with the 'about' route in your `router/index.js` file, the link will automatically update.

## 6. Dynamic Route Matching

Vue Router allows you to create dynamic routes with parameters. This is useful for displaying different content based on a specific ID or slug in the URL.

Modify your `router/index.js` file to include a dynamic route:

```javascript
// router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import HomeView from '../components/HomeView.vue';
import AboutView from '../components/AboutView.vue';
import UserView from '../components/UserView.vue'; // Import UserView

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeView
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: AboutView
  },
  {
    path: '/user/:id', // Dynamic segment :id
    name: 'user',
    component: UserView
  }
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
});

export default router;
```

Now, create a `UserView.vue` component to display the user information:

```vue
// components/UserView.vue
<template>
  <h1>User ID: {{ userId }}</h1>
</template>

<script>
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

export default {
  setup() {
    const route = useRoute();
    const userId = route.params.id;

    return { userId };
  }
};
</script>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`/user/:id`:** This defines a dynamic route with a parameter named `id`.  Any value after `/user/` will be captured as the `id` parameter.
*   **`useRoute`:** Inside the `UserView` component, we use the `useRoute` function (part of Vue Router 4) to access the current route object.
*   **`route.params.id`:** This allows us to access the value of the `id` parameter from the URL.

To link to a dynamic route, use the following:

```vue
<router-link :to="{ name: 'user', params: { id: 123 } }">User 123</router-link>
```

This will generate a link to `/user/123`.

## 7. Route Guards

Route guards are functions that can be used to control access to routes. They allow you to perform actions before, after, or while navigating to a route.  Common use cases include authentication, authorization, and data fetching.

Here are the different types of route guards:

*   **Global Guards:** Applied to all routes.
    *   `beforeEach`: Executed before each route is accessed.
    *   `afterEach`: Executed after each route is accessed.
*   **Per-Route Guards:** Applied to specific routes.
    *   `beforeEnter`: Executed before entering the route.
*   **In-Component Guards:** Defined within components.
    *   `beforeRouteEnter`: Executed before the component is rendered.
    *   `beforeRouteUpdate`: Executed when the route changes but the same component is reused (e.g., when navigating between `/user/1` and `/user/2` with the same `UserView` component).
    *   `beforeRouteLeave`: Executed before leaving the component.

**Example: Global `beforeEach` Guard**

Let's create a simple authentication guard that redirects users to a login page if they are not authenticated.

```javascript
// router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import HomeView from '../components/HomeView.vue';
import AboutView from '../components/AboutView.vue';
import LoginView from '../components/LoginView.vue'; // Import LoginView

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: HomeView,
    meta: { requiresAuth: true } // Add a meta field to indicate authentication requirement
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: AboutView,
    meta: { requiresAuth: true }
  },
  {
    path: '/login',
    name: 'login',
    component: LoginView
  }
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
});

router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem('isAuthenticated'); // Replace with your actual authentication logic

  if (to.meta.requiresAuth && !isAuthenticated) {
    next({ name: 'login' }); // Redirect to login page
  } else {
    next(); // Allow access to the route
  }
});

export default router;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`meta`:**  We added a `meta` field to the routes that require authentication.  This is a way to attach custom data to a route.
*   **`router.beforeEach`:** This registers a global `beforeEach` guard.
*   **`to`:**  The target Route object being navigated to.
*   **`from`:**  The current Route object navigating away from.
*   **`next`:**  A function to resolve the hook. Call `next()` to allow the navigation, `next(false)` to abort, or `next({ name: 'login' })` to redirect to a different route.
*   **`to.meta.requiresAuth`:**  We check if the target route requires authentication.
*   **`!isAuthenticated`:** We check if the user is not authenticated (using a placeholder `localStorage` item; replace this with your actual authentication mechanism).
*   **`next({ name: 'login' })`:** If the route requires authentication and the user is not authenticated, we redirect them to the `login` route.

## 8. Lazy Loading Components

Lazy loading is a technique that improves the initial load time of your application by only loading components when they are needed. This is especially useful for large applications with many routes and components.

To lazy load a component in Vue Router, use the `import()` function:

```javascript
// router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: () => import('../components/HomeView.vue') // Lazy load HomeView
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: () => import('../components/AboutView.vue') // Lazy load AboutView
  }
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
});

export default router;
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`component: () => import('../components/HomeView.vue')`:** Instead of directly importing the component, we use a function that returns a dynamic `import()`. This tells Vue Router to load the component only when the route is accessed.

## 9. Nested Routes

Vue Router allows you to create nested routes, which are routes that are children of other routes. This is useful for organizing complex UI structures with hierarchical relationships.

First, define the parent route and its children in `router/index.js`:

```javascript
// router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import UsersView from '../components/UsersView.vue'; // Parent route
import UserProfile from '../components/UserProfile.vue'; // Child route
import UserSettings from '../components/UserSettings.vue'; // Child route

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/users',
    component: UsersView,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'profile/:id',
        name: 'user-profile',
        component: UserProfile,
      },
      {
        path: 'settings',
        name: 'user-settings',
        component: UserSettings,
      },
    ],
  },
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
});

export default router;
```

Then, in the parent component (`UsersView.vue`), add a `<router-view>` to display the child routes:

```vue
// components/UsersView.vue
<template>
  <h1>Users</h1>
  <router-view />
</template>
```

And then you can link to the child routes:

```vue
// components/UsersView.vue
<template>
  <h1>Users</h1>
  <router-link :to="{ name: 'user-profile', params: { id: 1 } }">User Profile</router-link>
  <router-link :to="{ name: 'user-settings' }">User Settings</router-link>
  <router-view />
</template>
```

Visiting `/users/profile/1` would render both the `UsersView` component and the `UserProfile` component with `id` 1, nested within the `UsersView`. Visiting `/users/settings` would render the `UsersView` component and the `UserSettings` component.
