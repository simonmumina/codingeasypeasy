# SQL Server ASCII() Function: Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The `ASCII()` function in SQL Server is a built-in function that returns the ASCII value of the leftmost character in a given string. It's a fundamental tool for working with character encoding and understanding how strings are represented numerically within your database. This comprehensive guide will explore the `ASCII()` function in detail, providing syntax, practical examples, and best practices for its effective use in your SQL Server queries.

## Understanding ASCII

Before diving into the function itself, it's helpful to understand ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). ASCII is a character encoding standard where each character (letters, numbers, punctuation, control characters) is assigned a unique numerical value ranging from 0 to 127. The `ASCII()` function provides a way to retrieve this numerical representation for a given character.

## Syntax of the ASCII() Function

The syntax of the `ASCII()` function is straightforward:

```sql
ASCII ( character_expression )
```

Where:

- `character_expression`: This is the string or character that you want to convert to its ASCII value. It can be a `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `NCHAR`, or `NVARCHAR` data type.

## How the ASCII() Function Works

The `ASCII()` function evaluates the leftmost character of the input `character_expression` and returns its ASCII integer value. If the input is `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`. If the input is a string with multiple characters, only the first character's ASCII value is returned.

## Practical Examples of Using the ASCII() Function

Here are several examples demonstrating how to use the `ASCII()` function in SQL Server:

**1. Retrieving the ASCII value of a single character:**

```sql
SELECT ASCII('A'); -- Returns 65
SELECT ASCII('a'); -- Returns 97
SELECT ASCII('0'); -- Returns 48
SELECT ASCII('$'); -- Returns 36
```

This example showcases retrieving the ASCII values for an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character.

**2. Retrieving the ASCII value of the first character in a string:**

```sql
SELECT ASCII('Hello'); -- Returns 72 (ASCII of 'H')
SELECT ASCII('12345'); -- Returns 49 (ASCII of '1')
```

Even though the input is a string, the `ASCII()` function only considers the first character.

**3. Using the ASCII() function with variables:**

```sql
DECLARE @char CHAR(1) = 'B';
SELECT ASCII(@char); -- Returns 66

DECLARE @string VARCHAR(10) = 'World';
SELECT ASCII(@string); -- Returns 87 (ASCII of 'W')
```

This example demonstrates using variables to store the character or string and then passing them to the `ASCII()` function.

**4. Handling NULL values:**

```sql
SELECT ASCII(NULL); -- Returns NULL
```

As mentioned earlier, if the input is `NULL`, the `ASCII()` function returns `NULL`.

**5. Using ASCII() in a WHERE clause:**

You can use the `ASCII()` function in a `WHERE` clause to filter data based on the ASCII value of a character.

```sql
CREATE TABLE MyTable (
    ID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO MyTable (Name) VALUES
('Apple'),
('Banana'),
('apple'),
('Cherry');

SELECT *
FROM MyTable
WHERE ASCII(Name) > 96; -- Returns rows where the first character's ASCII value is greater than 96 (lowercase letters)
```

This example creates a table and then filters the data to retrieve rows where the first character of the `Name` column has an ASCII value greater than 96, effectively filtering for names that begin with lowercase letters.

**6. Combining ASCII() with other string functions:**

You can combine the `ASCII()` function with other string functions like `SUBSTRING` or `LEFT` for more complex string manipulation.

```sql
SELECT ASCII(SUBSTRING('SQL Server', 1, 1)); -- Returns 83 (ASCII of 'S')

SELECT ASCII(LEFT('Database', 1)); -- Returns 68 (ASCII of 'D')
```

This shows how to use `ASCII()` after extracting a substring or the leftmost characters of a string.

**7. Finding characters based on a specific ASCII range:**

This example demonstrates how to find all records in a table where the first character falls within a certain ASCII range, useful for identifying specific types of characters (e.g., uppercase letters, numbers).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM MyTable
WHERE ASCII(Name) BETWEEN 65 AND 90;  -- Find names that start with uppercase letters (ASCII 65-90)
```

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

- **Data Types:** Ensure that the `character_expression` you provide to the `ASCII()` function is of a character data type (`CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR`). If you pass a numeric or other data type, SQL Server might implicitly convert it to a string, leading to unexpected results.

- **Unicode vs. ASCII:** The `ASCII()` function only returns values within the ASCII range (0-127). For characters outside this range (e.g., characters from non-English alphabets), consider using the `UNICODE()` function, which returns the Unicode code point of the character. SQL Server uses Unicode by default for `NCHAR` and `NVARCHAR` data types.

- **Performance:** In general, the `ASCII()` function has good performance. However, using it extensively in `WHERE` clauses, especially on large tables, might impact query performance. Consider creating an index on the relevant column if performance becomes an issue.

- **Case Sensitivity:** The `ASCII()` function is case-sensitive. The ASCII value of 'A' is different from the ASCII value of 'a'.

- **Globalization:** When working with globalized data, be aware that the ASCII character set is limited. For international character sets, Unicode is preferred, and you should use the `UNICODE()` function instead.

## ASCII() vs. UNICODE()

As mentioned above, it's crucial to understand the difference between `ASCII()` and `UNICODE()`. While `ASCII()` returns the ASCII value (0-127) of a character, `UNICODE()` returns the Unicode code point, which can represent a much wider range of characters.

```sql
SELECT ASCII('A');       -- Returns 65
SELECT UNICODE('A');     -- Returns 65

SELECT ASCII('é');       -- Returns 130 (approximation, may vary depending on collation)
SELECT UNICODE('é');     -- Returns 233 (accurate Unicode code point)
```

If you're working with data that includes characters from different languages or special symbols, `UNICODE()` is the preferred function.

## Common Use Cases for the ASCII() Function

- **Data Validation:** Validating input data to ensure it adheres to certain character restrictions (e.g., allowing only alphanumeric characters).
- **String Manipulation:** Performing character-based operations on strings, such as sorting or filtering based on the ASCII value.
- **Data Conversion:** Converting characters to their ASCII equivalents for storage or transmission in systems that require ASCII encoding.
- **Character Classification:** Determining the type of character (e.g., uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit) based on its ASCII value.
- **Collation Considerations**: Be mindful of the SQL Server Collation in use. Collations define rules for sorting and comparing data. Different collations might affect how characters are interpreted and how their ASCII values are handled, particularly when dealing with characters outside the basic ASCII range.

## Conclusion

The `ASCII()` function in SQL Server is a valuable tool for working with character encoding and performing string manipulation tasks. By understanding its syntax, behavior, and limitations, you can effectively use it to validate data, filter results, and convert characters to their numerical representations. Remember to consider the limitations of ASCII and use the `UNICODE()` function when dealing with international character sets or when needing precise representation of characters beyond the ASCII range. Always test your queries thoroughly to ensure they produce the expected results, especially when working with different character encodings and collations.
