# Secure FastAPI Applications with OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. In other words, it provides a standardized way to authenticate users across different applications and services.

This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on how to integrate OpenID Connect (OIDC) with FastAPI, a modern, high-performance, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. We will cover the key concepts, configuration, and implementation details, empowering you to build secure and robust APIs.

## Why Use OpenID Connect with FastAPI?

- **Standardized Authentication:** OIDC leverages a well-defined standard for authentication, promoting interoperability and reducing vendor lock-in.
- **Simplified User Management:** Delegate user authentication and management to a trusted identity provider (IdP) like Google, Auth0, Okta, or your own custom solution. This simplifies your application's logic and reduces the burden of managing user credentials.
- **Enhanced Security:** OIDC offers a secure and auditable authentication process, protecting your API from unauthorized access. It leverages JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token exchange.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Enable users to authenticate once and access multiple applications within your ecosystem, improving user experience and productivity.
- **Reduced Development Effort:** By leveraging existing OIDC libraries and tools, you can significantly reduce the development time and complexity associated with implementing authentication.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+:** FastAPI requires Python 3.7 or higher.
- **FastAPI:** Install FastAPI using pip: `pip install fastapi`
- **Uvicorn:** A ASGI server for running FastAPI: `pip install uvicorn`
- **A Python OIDC Library:** We will use `python-jose` and `fastapi-oidc` in this tutorial. Install them using pip: `pip install python-jose fastapi-oidc`
- **An OIDC Provider:** You'll need an OIDC provider like Google, Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, or a custom implementation. For this tutorial, we'll use a generic example and show you how to configure your FastAPI application to interact with it.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Integrating OIDC with FastAPI

### 1. Setting up Your OIDC Provider

Before diving into the code, you need to configure your OIDC provider. The exact steps will vary depending on the provider you choose. However, the general process involves:

- **Creating an Application/Client:** Register your FastAPI application as a client with your OIDC provider. This will typically involve providing a name for your application and a redirect URI.
- **Configuring Redirect URI:** The redirect URI is the URL to which the OIDC provider will redirect the user after successful authentication. In your FastAPI application, this will be a specific endpoint designed to handle the callback from the OIDC provider. For local development, this might be `http://localhost:8000/callback`.
- **Obtaining Client Credentials:** Your OIDC provider will provide you with a client ID and a client secret. These credentials are used by your FastAPI application to authenticate with the OIDC provider.
- **Discovering the OIDC Configuration:** OIDC providers typically expose a discovery endpoint (e.g., `https://your-oidc-provider/.well-known/openid-configuration`). This endpoint provides essential metadata about the provider, such as the authorization endpoint, token endpoint, and JWKS URI (JSON Web Key Set URI).

**Important Note:** For production environments, **never** hardcode your client secret directly into your code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store and manage sensitive credentials.

### 2. Installing the Necessary Libraries

As mentioned earlier, install the following libraries using pip:

```plaintext
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-jose fastapi-oidc
```

### 3. Implementing OIDC Authentication in FastAPI

Here's a complete example of how to integrate OIDC authentication into your FastAPI application using the `fastapi-oidc` library:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from fastapi_oidc import OIDCAuthentication, OIDCUser, UserInfo
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Configuration (Replace with your actual values)
OIDC_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_OIDC_CLIENT_ID"
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET"
OIDC_ISSUER = "YOUR_OIDC_ISSUER"  # e.g., "https://your-oidc-provider"
OIDC_SCOPES = ["openid", "profile", "email"]
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000" #Important for generating the redirect URL.

# Initialize FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

# Initialize OIDC Authentication
oidc_auth = OIDCAuthentication(
    app,
    client_id=OIDC_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET,
    issuer=OIDC_ISSUER,
    scopes=OIDC_SCOPES,
    redirect_uri=f"{BASE_URL}/callback" #Ensure this matches what is registered in your OIDC Provider
)

# Custom User Data Model (Optional) - If your OIDC Provider provides more information
class CustomUserInfo(BaseModel):
  given_name: str
  family_name: str

# Protected Endpoint
@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route(user: OIDCUser = Depends(oidc_auth.get_current_user(user_info_model=CustomUserInfo))):
    """
    A protected route that requires authentication.  Access to this route
    is only granted to authenticated users.
    """
    return {"message": f"Hello, {user.email} (Name: {user.user_info.given_name} {user.user_info.family_name})!  You are authenticated."}

# Example route where the user will get redirected if not logged in.
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    """
    The application entrypoint.  Try to access a protected route to start
    the authentication process.
    """
    return HTMLResponse(content="<h1>Welcome!  Try accessing /protected to authenticate.</h1>")


# Callback Endpoint - Required by fastapi-oidc library, do not change
@app.get("/callback")
async def callback(code: str = None, state: str = None, session_id: str = Depends(oidc_auth.session_id_generator)):
    return await oidc_auth.callback(code, state, session_id)


# Logout Endpoint
@app.get("/logout")
async def logout(session_id: str = Depends(oidc_auth.session_id_generator)):
    """
    Logs the user out by destroying the session.
    """
    oidc_auth.logout(session_id)
    return {"message": "Successfully logged out."}



if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Statements:** Import the necessary modules from FastAPI and the `fastapi-oidc` library.
2.  **Configuration:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual OIDC provider configuration. Pay close attention to the `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_SCOPES`, and `BASE_URL`. The `redirect_uri` must match the URI configured in your OIDC Provider.
3.  **FastAPI Initialization:** Create a FastAPI application instance.
4.  **OIDC Authentication Initialization:** Create an `OIDCAuthentication` instance, passing in your configuration parameters. This initializes the library and sets up the necessary routes and logic for OIDC authentication.
5.  **Protected Endpoint (`/protected`):**
    - The `@app.get("/protected")` decorator defines a protected route that requires authentication.
    - `user: OIDCUser = Depends(oidc_auth.get_current_user(user_info_model=CustomUserInfo))` This is the core of the authentication. The `Depends` function injects the currently authenticated user into the route handler. The `oidc_auth.get_current_user()` method handles the authentication process. It checks for a valid access token, verifies it against the OIDC provider, and returns an `OIDCUser` object containing user information. If user is not authenticated, it automatically redirects the user to the OIDC provider's login page. You can add an optional `user_info_model` (example `CustomUserInfo`) to parse extra user information sent by the OIDC Provider. If the validation fails it will raise an `HTTPException` with status code 401 (Unauthorized)
    - The route handler simply returns a greeting message, demonstrating that the user is authenticated.
6.  **Root Endpoint (`/`):** This route redirects to the protected endpoint to initiate the authentication if the user is not logged in.
7.  **Callback Endpoint (`/callback`):** The `fastapi-oidc` library requires a `/callback` endpoint to handle the redirection from the OIDC Provider. This endpoint should **not** be changed.
8.  **Logout Endpoint (`/logout`):** The `/logout` endpoint is optional but recommended. It allows users to explicitly log out of the application.
9.  **Running the Application:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block starts the Uvicorn server, which hosts your FastAPI application.

### 4. Running the Application

Save the code to a file (e.g., `main.py`) and run it using Uvicorn:

```plaintext
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 5. Testing the Authentication

1.  **Access `/protected`:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/protected`.
2.  **Redirect to OIDC Provider:** You should be redirected to your OIDC provider's login page.
3.  **Authenticate:** Enter your credentials and authenticate with the OIDC provider.
4.  **Redirect Back:** After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to your FastAPI application's `/callback` endpoint.
5.  **Access Granted:** You should now see the greeting message on the `/protected` route, confirming that you are authenticated.
6.  **Logout** Access `/logout` endpoint to log out of the application.

## Advanced Configuration and Customization

### Handling JWT Validation Errors

The `fastapi-oidc` library automatically handles JWT validation. If validation fails, an `HTTPException` with status code 401 (Unauthorized) is raised. You can customize the error handling by using FastAPI's exception handlers.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi_oidc import OIDCAuthentication, OIDCUser, UserInfo

# ... (previous code) ...

@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)
async def http_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: HTTPException):
    if exc.status_code == 401:
        return JSONResponse(
            status_code=401,
            content={"message": "Authentication failed: " + str(exc.detail)},
        )
    return await app.default_error_handler(request, exc)

# ... (rest of the code) ...
```

### Custom User Information

The `fastapi-oidc` library allows you to access user information (claims) from the ID token. You can define a custom Pydantic model for the user information.

```plaintext
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CustomUserInfo(BaseModel):
    given_name: str
    family_name: str
    email_verified: bool

@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route(user: OIDCUser[CustomUserInfo] = Depends(oidc_auth.get_current_user(user_info_model=CustomUserInfo))):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {user.user_info.given_name} {user.user_info.family_name}! Your email is verified: {user.user_info.email_verified}"}
```

### Refresh Tokens (Advanced)

If your OIDC provider supports refresh tokens, you can implement token refreshing to maintain user sessions without requiring them to re-authenticate frequently. The `fastapi-oidc` library does not directly handle refresh tokens, but you can implement this functionality yourself using the access token and refresh token endpoints provided by your OIDC provider. This is beyond the scope of this introductory guide.

## Best Practices for OIDC Integration

- **Securely Store Client Credentials:** Never hardcode your client secret directly into your code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
- **Validate the `iss` Claim:** Always validate the `iss` (issuer) claim in the ID token to ensure that the token originated from your trusted OIDC provider. The `fastapi-oidc` library should handle this automatically.
- **Use HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt communication between your FastAPI application and the OIDC provider.
- **Implement Proper Error Handling:** Handle JWT validation errors and other exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user.
- **Regularly Review Security Configuration:** Review your OIDC configuration regularly to ensure that it is up-to-date and secure.
- **Proper Redirect URL Configuration:** Ensure your redirect URLs in your OIDC provider settings exactly match the `redirect_uri` you set in your FastAPI application. Mismatched redirect URLs are a common cause of authentication failures.
