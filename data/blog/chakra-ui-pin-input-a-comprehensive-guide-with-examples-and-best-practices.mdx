# Chakra UI Pin Input: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples & Best Practices

The Chakra UI Pin Input component provides a clean and accessible way to handle numeric input fields commonly used for OTP (One-Time Password) verification, security codes, and other sensitive data entry scenarios. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from basic implementation to advanced customization and best practices.

## What is Chakra UI Pin Input?

The `PinInput` component in Chakra UI is a pre-built, styled, and accessible component that simplifies the process of creating a numeric input field where users enter a sequence of digits. It manages focusing, value propagation, and accessibility features automatically, freeing you to focus on the overall application logic.

## Why Use Chakra UI Pin Input?

- **Accessibility:** Chakra UI components are built with accessibility in mind, ensuring your forms are usable by everyone, including users with disabilities. Pin Input includes ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support for a seamless experience.
- **Customization:** Easily customize the appearance of the Pin Input to match your application's design using Chakra UI's theming system and style props.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look and feel across your application by using Chakra UI's pre-defined styles and themes.
- **Developer Experience:** Chakra UI offers a smooth developer experience with a clear and intuitive API.
- **Performance:** Chakra UI components are optimized for performance, ensuring a fast and responsive user interface.

## Basic Usage: Getting Started with Pin Input

First, make sure you have Chakra UI installed in your project:

```plaintext
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
# or
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
```

Now, let's create a simple Pin Input component:

```jsx
import { PinInput, PinInputField, HStack } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

function BasicPinInput() {
  const [pin, setPin] = useState('')

  const handleChange = (value) => {
    setPin(value)
    console.log('PIN:', value) // You'd typically do something more useful with the PIN here.
  }

  return (
    <HStack>
      <PinInput
        onChange={handleChange}
        type="number"
        value={pin}
        size="md" // Optional: Adjust size (sm, md, lg)
        // Optional: Add margin or padding around the whole input
      >
        <PinInputField />
        <PinInputField />
        <PinInputField />
        <PinInputField />
      </PinInput>
    </HStack>
  )
}

export default BasicPinInput
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import:** We import `PinInput` and `PinInputField` from `@chakra-ui/react`, as well as `HStack` for layout purposes. `useState` is used to manage the input value.
2.  **`useState`:** We use the `useState` hook to manage the pin value in the component's state. This allows us to control and react to changes in the Pin Input.
3.  **`PinInput`:** The `<PinInput>` component acts as the container for the individual input fields. It handles the overall logic of the pin input.
    - **`onChange`:** This prop is crucial. It's a function that's called whenever the pin value changes. The complete pin value is passed as an argument to this function. In this example, we're using it to update the `pin` state and log the value to the console. In a real application, you would likely use this to verify the PIN against a backend service or perform other actions.
    - **`type="number"`:** This ensures that only numeric input is allowed. Although `PinInput` handles numeric input, specifying the type provides an extra layer of validation and helps with mobile keyboards.
    - **`value`**: This is important for controlled components. By setting the `value` prop, we bind the Pin Input to the component's state. This means that changes to the state will automatically update the input field, and vice-versa.
    - **`size`**: This allows you to control the size of the input fields (e.g., "sm", "md", "lg").
4.  **`PinInputField`:** The `<PinInputField>` component represents a single input field within the Pin Input. You need to include one `PinInputField` for each digit of the pin.

## Customizing the Pin Input

Chakra UI provides a flexible way to customize the appearance of the Pin Input component. You can use style props, themes, or custom styles to achieve the desired look and feel.

### Using Style Props

You can directly apply style props to the `PinInput` and `PinInputField` components:

```jsx
import { PinInput, PinInputField, HStack } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

function CustomPinInput() {
  const [pin, setPin] = useState('')

  const handleChange = (value) => {
    setPin(value)
  }

  return (
    <HStack>
      <PinInput
        onChange={handleChange}
        type="number"
        value={pin}
        size="lg"
        spacing="4" // Adjust spacing between inputs
        colorScheme="green" // Change the color scheme
      >
        <PinInputField
          border="2px solid"
          borderColor="gray.300"
          borderRadius="md"
          _focus={{
            borderColor: 'green.500',
            boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px green.500', // Add a subtle box shadow on focus
          }}
        />
        <PinInputField
          border="2px solid"
          borderColor="gray.300"
          borderRadius="md"
          _focus={{
            borderColor: 'green.500',
            boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px green.500', // Add a subtle box shadow on focus
          }}
        />
        <PinInputField
          border="2px solid"
          borderColor="gray.300"
          borderRadius="md"
          _focus={{
            borderColor: 'green.500',
            boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px green.500', // Add a subtle box shadow on focus
          }}
        />
        <PinInputField
          border="2px solid"
          borderColor="gray.300"
          borderRadius="md"
          _focus={{
            borderColor: 'green.500',
            boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px green.500', // Add a subtle box shadow on focus
          }}
        />
      </PinInput>
    </HStack>
  )
}

export default CustomPinInput
```

**Explanation:**

- **`spacing`:** Controls the space between the individual input fields.
- **`colorScheme`:** Uses Chakra UI's color schemes to style the input fields, particularly the focus state.
- **`border`, `borderColor`, `borderRadius`:** Control the appearance of the input field borders.
- **`_focus`:** Allows you to style the input field when it's in focus. We're changing the border color and adding a box shadow for a visual cue.

### Using Themes

For more complex and reusable styling, consider using Chakra UI's theme system. You can extend the default theme to customize the appearance of the `PinInput` component.

```jsx
// theme/index.js (or similar)
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react';

const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    PinInput: {
      baseStyle: {
        field: {
          border: '1px solid',
          borderColor: 'gray.200',
          _focus: {
            borderColor: 'blue.500',
            boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px blue.500',
          },
        },
      },
      sizes: {
        md: {
          field: {
            fontSize: 'md',
            width: '40px',
            height: '40px',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

export default theme;

// Wrap your application with the ChakraProvider and pass the theme
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import theme from './theme';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;

//  Then use the PinInput in your component:
import { PinInput, PinInputField, HStack } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import { useState } from 'react';

function ThemedPinInput() {
  const [pin, setPin] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (value) => {
    setPin(value);
  };

  return (
    <HStack>
      <PinInput
        onChange={handleChange}
        type="number"
        value={pin}
        size="md" // Uses the size defined in the theme
      >
        <PinInputField />
        <PinInputField />
        <PinInputField />
        <PinInputField />
      </PinInput>
    </HStack>
  );
}

export default ThemedPinInput;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Theme Extension:** We use `extendTheme` to modify the default Chakra UI theme.
2.  **Component Specific Styling:** We target the `PinInput` component within the `components` section of the theme.
3.  **`baseStyle`:** Defines the default styles for all `PinInput` fields. We're setting the border and focus styles here.
4.  **`sizes`:** Allows you to customize the styles for different sizes of the `PinInput` (e.g., "sm", "md", "lg"). We're setting the font size, width, and height for the "md" size.
5.  **`ChakraProvider`**: Make sure to wrap your application with `ChakraProvider` and pass the theme you created.

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development, and Chakra UI makes it easier to create accessible components. Here are some points to consider when using the Pin Input component:

- **Labels:** Use appropriate labels to describe the purpose of the Pin Input field. While the visual label might be implied in context (e.g., "Enter OTP"), consider providing an `aria-label` or wrapping the input in a `<label>` element for screen reader users.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear and concise error messages if the entered pin is invalid. Use `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` to associate the error message with the input field.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Chakra UI Pin Input provides automatic keyboard navigation. Users can use the arrow keys to move between the input fields. Ensure that this functionality is not overridden or broken.

```jsx
import {
  PinInput,
  PinInputField,
  HStack,
  FormLabel,
  FormControl,
  FormErrorMessage,
} from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { useState } from 'react'

function AccessiblePinInput() {
  const [pin, setPin] = useState('')
  const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false)

  const handleChange = (value) => {
    setPin(value)
    setIsError(value.length !== 4) // Example validation: PIN must be 4 digits
  }

  return (
    <FormControl isInvalid={isError}>
      <FormLabel htmlFor="otp-input">Enter OTP:</FormLabel>
      <HStack>
        <PinInput
          id="otp-input"
          onChange={handleChange}
          type="number"
          value={pin}
          size="md"
          aria-describedby="otp-error-text" // Associate error message
        >
          <PinInputField />
          <PinInputField />
          <PinInputField />
          <PinInputField />
        </PinInput>
      </HStack>
      {isError ? (
        <FormErrorMessage id="otp-error-text">OTP must be 4 digits.</FormErrorMessage>
      ) : null}
    </FormControl>
  )
}

export default AccessiblePinInput
```

**Explanation:**

- **`FormControl`, `FormLabel`, `FormErrorMessage`:** These components from Chakra UI are used to create accessible forms.
- **`htmlFor` and `id`:** The `htmlFor` attribute on the `FormLabel` is linked to the `id` of the `PinInput`, providing an accessible label for screen readers.
- **`isInvalid`:** The `isInvalid` prop on the `FormControl` indicates whether the input is invalid.
- **`aria-describedby`:** This attribute links the input field to the error message element, allowing screen readers to announce the error message when the input is focused.
- **Conditional Error Message:** The `FormErrorMessage` is displayed only when `isError` is true.

## Best Practices

- **Validation:** Implement robust validation to ensure that the entered pin is in the correct format and meets your application's requirements.
- **Security:** Handle the pin securely. Do not store it in plain text. Use proper encryption techniques to protect sensitive data.
- **User Experience:** Provide clear instructions to the user about the expected format of the pin. Display helpful error messages if the entered pin is invalid. Consider providing a "resend OTP" option if the user does not receive the pin in a timely manner.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure that the Pin Input component functions correctly and handles different scenarios.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Test the Pin Input component on different mobile devices to ensure that it is responsive and user-friendly.

## Advanced Usage

### Masking the Input

While `PinInput` is typically used for numeric input, you might want to mask the input for security reasons. Chakra UI doesn't directly provide masking, but you can achieve this with a bit of custom logic. However, it's generally better to rely on the inherent security of OTP processes rather than trying to visually mask the input, as it can be confusing for users. If masking is absolutely necessary, consider using a different input type or a custom component built from scratch.

### Focusing Next Input Field

Chakra UI `PinInput` handles focusing the next input field automatically. As the user enters a digit, focus will shift to the next field. However, you can customize this behaviour as per your requirements using refs and `focus()` method.

## Conclusion

The Chakra UI Pin Input component is a powerful and versatile tool for creating secure and user-friendly verification interfaces. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively leverage the Pin Input component to enhance the user experience and security of your applications. Remember to prioritize accessibility, security, and user experience when implementing the Pin Input component. Good luck!
