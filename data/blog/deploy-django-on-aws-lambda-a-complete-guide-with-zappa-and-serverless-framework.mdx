# Deploy Django on AWS Lambda: A Complete Guide with Zappa & Serverless Framework

Django, a powerful and versatile Python web framework, is traditionally deployed on servers. However, the rise of serverless computing offers a cost-effective and scalable alternative. This guide will walk you through deploying your Django application to AWS Lambda using two popular tools: Zappa and the Serverless Framework. We'll cover the benefits, setup, configuration, and deployment process, including code examples.

## Why Deploy Django on AWS Lambda?

Deploying Django on AWS Lambda provides several advantages:

- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for the compute time your application uses. No more idle server costs.
- **Scalability:** AWS Lambda automatically scales your application based on demand.
- **Simplified Operations:** Focus on your code, not server management. Lambda handles patching, updates, and security.
- **Reduced Infrastructure Overhead:** Eliminate the need for traditional web servers like Apache or Nginx.

## Choosing the Right Tool: Zappa vs. Serverless Framework

Both Zappa and the Serverless Framework enable deploying Django applications to AWS Lambda. Here's a brief comparison:

- **Zappa:** Designed specifically for deploying Python web applications, particularly Django and Flask. It's known for its ease of use and Django-centric features. It directly interacts with AWS services.

- **Serverless Framework:** A more general-purpose framework that supports multiple languages and cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). It's highly customizable and powerful but can have a steeper learning curve. It relies on a configuration file (`serverless.yml`) to define your infrastructure and deployment process.

For this guide, we'll explore both methods, starting with Zappa and then the Serverless Framework.

## Method 1: Deploying Django with Zappa

### Prerequisites

1.  **AWS Account:** You'll need an AWS account with appropriate permissions (IAM user with AdministratorAccess is simplest for testing, but consider more restricted permissions for production).
2.  **Python and Pip:** Python 3.7 or later is recommended. Ensure `pip` is installed.
3.  **Virtual Environment (venv):** Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

    ```plaintext
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

4.  **Django Project:** Have a Django project ready. If you don't have one, create a new project:

    ```plaintext
    pip install django
    django-admin startproject myproject
    cd myproject
    python manage.py startapp myapp
    ```

### Installation and Configuration

1.  **Install Zappa:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install zappa
    ```

2.  **Initialize Zappa:**

    ```plaintext
    zappa init
    ```

    Zappa will ask a series of questions to configure your deployment. Here's a typical example:

    - **Project name:** `myproject` (or your project name)
    - **AWS Region:** `us-east-1` (or your preferred region)
    - **Deployment environment:** `dev` (or `production`)
    - **Python version:** `3.9` (or your Python version)
    - **Manage AWS IAM policies:** `y` (Zappa will create necessary IAM roles)

    This process creates a `zappa_settings.json` file in your project root. This file contains the configuration for your Zappa deployments.

3.  **Customize `zappa_settings.json`:**

    Open `zappa_settings.json` and review the settings. Here's a sample `zappa_settings.json` file:

    ```plaintext
    {
      "dev": {
        "app_function": "myproject.wsgi.application",
        "aws_region": "us-east-1",
        "profile_name": null,
        "project_name": "myproject",
        "runtime": "python3.9",
        "s3_bucket": "zappa-myproject-dev", // Zappa will create this bucket
        "manage_roles": true,
        "slim_handler": true,
        "memory_size": 512,
        "timeout": 30,
        "keep_warm": false,
        "environment_variables": {
          "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE": "myproject.settings"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Key settings to consider:

    - `app_function`: Specifies the WSGI application entry point. Defaults to `your_project.wsgi.application`.
    - `aws_region`: The AWS region for deployment.
    - `s3_bucket`: The S3 bucket Zappa will use to store your code package. Zappa will create this bucket if it doesn't exist. Choose a unique name.
    - `runtime`: The Python runtime to use on Lambda. Ensure this matches your local Python version.
    - `environment_variables`: Environment variables required by your Django application, such as `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`.

### Deploying Your Django Application

1.  **Deploy with Zappa:**

    ```plaintext
    zappa deploy dev
    ```

    This command packages your Django application, uploads it to the S3 bucket, creates the necessary Lambda function and API Gateway endpoint, and configures them to work together. The output will include the API Gateway URL, which is your application's endpoint.

2.  **Access Your Application:**

    Open the API Gateway URL in your browser to access your Django application.

### Updating Your Application

To update your application after making changes, use:

```plaintext
zappa update dev
```

This command redeploys your application with the latest code.

### Undoing a Deployment

To remove the deployed application and its resources:

```plaintext
zappa undeploy dev
```

This will delete the Lambda function, API Gateway endpoint, and other related resources.

### Handling Static Files and Media Files

Serving static and media files requires additional configuration:

1.  **Configure Static Files:**

    In your `settings.py`:

    ```plaintext
    STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    ```

    Collect static files:

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

    In `zappa_settings.json`, add:

    ```plaintext
    "dev": {
        // ... other settings
        "include": ["staticfiles"]
    }
    ```

2.  **Configure Media Files:** (If you are using user uploaded files)

    In your `settings.py`:

    ```plaintext
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
    ```

    In `zappa_settings.json`, add:

    ```plaintext
    "dev": {
        // ... other settings
        "include": ["media"]
    }
    ```

    **Important:** Storing media files directly in the Lambda deployment package is generally not recommended for production due to size limitations and immutability. Instead, consider using an S3 bucket to store media files and configure your Django application to serve them from S3 (e.g., using `django-storages`).

    Here's how you can configure `django-storages` with S3:

    ```plaintext
    pip install django-storages
    ```

    In your `settings.py`:

    ```plaintext
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-s3-bucket-name'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'us-east-1'
    AWS_S3_FILE_OVERWRITE = False
    AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = 'public-read'
    ```

    Remember to set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME` environment variables. You can set these in the Lambda environment configuration through the AWS console or `zappa_settings.json` (though the AWS console is more secure for credentials).

    Don't forget to add `storages` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

    ```plaintext
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'storages',
    ]
    ```

## Method 2: Deploying Django with the Serverless Framework

### Prerequisites

1.  **AWS Account:** (Same as Zappa)
2.  **Python and Pip:** (Same as Zappa)
3.  **Virtual Environment (venv):** (Same as Zappa)
4.  **Django Project:** (Same as Zappa)
5.  **Node.js and npm:** The Serverless Framework is built on Node.js. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
6.  **Serverless Framework CLI:** Install the Serverless Framework globally:

    ```plaintext
    npm install -g serverless
    ```

7.  **AWS CLI:** Install and configure the AWS CLI:

    ```plaintext
    pip install awscli
    aws configure
    ```

    The AWS CLI will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and region. You can obtain these from the AWS IAM console.

### Installation and Configuration

1.  **Create a `serverless.yml` file:**

    In your Django project root directory, create a file named `serverless.yml`. This file defines your serverless application. Here's an example:

    ```plaintext
    service: django-on-lambda # Your service name

    frameworkVersion: '3'

    provider:
      name: aws
      runtime: python3.9
      region: us-east-1 # Your AWS region
      memorySize: 512
      timeout: 30
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: myproject.settings # Important!
      iam:
        role:
          statements:
            - Effect: 'Allow'
              Action:
                - 's3:GetObject'
                - 's3:PutObject'
                - 's3:DeleteObject'
              Resource: 'arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME/*' # Replace with your S3 bucket ARN

    functions:
      django:
        handler: wsgi_handler.handler
        events:
          - http: ANY {proxy+}
          - http: ANY

    package:
      exclude:
        - ./**
      include:
        - wsgi_handler.py
        - myproject/** # Include your project
        - myapp/** # Include your app(s)
        - requirements.txt
        - staticfiles/** # If you're serving static files

    plugins:
      - serverless-python-requirements
    ```

    Key aspects of the `serverless.yml` file:

    - `service`: A unique name for your serverless application.
    - `provider`: Configures the cloud provider (AWS in this case), runtime (Python version), region, memory, timeout, and environment variables. Make sure to set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. The `iam` section defines the permissions needed by your Lambda function. Replace `YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME` with your actual S3 bucket name (if you're using S3 for media files or anything else).
    - `functions`: Defines the Lambda functions in your application. The `django` function handles all incoming HTTP requests. `handler: wsgi_handler.handler` specifies the entry point for the Lambda function. The `events` section defines the HTTP events that trigger the function. `{proxy+}` catches all requests to your base URL and passes them to your Django app, and `ANY` catches requests to the root.
    - `package`: Specifies which files to include in the deployment package. Crucially, you _must_ include your `wsgi_handler.py` file, your Django project directory, your Django app directories, `requirements.txt`, and any static files.
    - `plugins`: Lists the Serverless Framework plugins you want to use. `serverless-python-requirements` automatically installs your Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` when you deploy.

2.  **Create `wsgi_handler.py`:**

    In your project root directory, create a file named `wsgi_handler.py` with the following content:

    ```plaintext
    import os
    import django
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')  # Important!

    django.setup()

    application = get_wsgi_application()

    def handler(event, context):
        """
        AWS Lambda handler function.
        """
        from serverless_wsgi import handle_request

        return handle_request(application, event, context)
    ```

    This file acts as the entry point for your Lambda function. It initializes Django and uses the `serverless-wsgi` library to handle HTTP requests from API Gateway.

3.  **Install `serverless-wsgi`:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install serverless-wsgi
    ```

4.  **Create `requirements.txt`:**

    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root directory listing all your project dependencies, including Django, `serverless-wsgi`, and any other libraries your application uses. You can generate this automatically:

    ```plaintext
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

    Edit `requirements.txt` to ensure it only contains the necessary packages for deployment.

5.  **Install Serverless Python Requirements Plugin:**

    ```plaintext
    serverless plugin install serverless-python-requirements
    ```

### Deploying Your Django Application

1.  **Deploy with Serverless Framework:**

    ```plaintext
    serverless deploy
    ```

    The Serverless Framework will:

    - Package your application.
    - Create an S3 bucket (if one doesn't exist).
    - Upload your application package to S3.
    - Create a Lambda function.
    - Create an API Gateway endpoint.
    - Configure the Lambda function to handle HTTP requests from API Gateway.

    The output will include the API Gateway URL for your application.

2.  **Access Your Application:**

    Open the API Gateway URL in your browser to access your Django application.

### Updating Your Application

To update your application:

```plaintext
serverless deploy
```

### Removing Your Application

To remove your application and its resources:

```plaintext
serverless remove
```

### Handling Static Files and Media Files (Serverless Framework)

The same considerations for static and media files apply to the Serverless Framework as they do to Zappa. You'll likely want to serve media files from S3 using `django-storages` as described earlier. Ensure you include the `staticfiles` directory in the `package` section of your `serverless.yml` file.

## Conclusion

This guide has shown you two ways to deploy your Django application to AWS Lambda: using Zappa and the Serverless Framework. Zappa offers a simpler, Django-focused approach, while the Serverless Framework provides more flexibility and control. Choose the tool that best suits your project's needs and your comfort level. By embracing serverless deployment, you can unlock significant cost savings, improved scalability, and reduced operational overhead for your Django applications. Remember to handle static and media files properly, ideally by leveraging S3 and `django-storages`. Good luck deploying!
