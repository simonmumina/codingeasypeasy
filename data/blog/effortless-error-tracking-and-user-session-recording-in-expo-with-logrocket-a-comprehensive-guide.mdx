# Effortless Error Tracking & User Session Recording in Expo with LogRocket: A Comprehensive Guide

Debugging mobile applications, especially in complex frameworks like Expo, can be a significant challenge. Pinpointing the root cause of errors and understanding user behavior is crucial for delivering a high-quality app experience. That's where LogRocket comes in. LogRocket provides powerful error tracking and user session recording, enabling you to effectively diagnose issues, reproduce bugs, and gain valuable insights into how users interact with your Expo application.

This guide will walk you through integrating LogRocket into your Expo project step-by-step, complete with code examples, best practices, and advanced configurations.

## What is LogRocket?

LogRocket is a frontend monitoring and product analytics platform that combines error tracking, session replay, and product analytics into a single, user-friendly tool. It allows you to:

- **See what your users see:** Watch exactly what users did leading up to an error.
- **Identify root causes faster:** LogRocket automatically surfaces errors and performance issues.
- **Improve user experience:** Understand user behavior and identify areas for optimization.

## Why Use LogRocket with Expo?

Expo offers a fantastic developer experience for building cross-platform mobile apps. However, even with Expo's ease of use, debugging and monitoring remain crucial. LogRocket significantly enhances your debugging capabilities by providing:

- **Session Replays:** Record user sessions to understand the exact steps that lead to errors or unexpected behavior. This eliminates guesswork and allows you to reproduce issues with ease.
- **Error Tracking:** Automatically capture unhandled exceptions, console errors, and network requests that fail.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your app for speed and responsiveness.
- **Contextual Information:** LogRocket provides rich contextual information about the user's environment, device, and application state, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track issues and user behavior in real-time to respond quickly to problems.

## Integrating LogRocket into Your Expo App

Let's dive into the integration process.

### 1. Install the LogRocket SDK

First, install the LogRocket JavaScript SDK using your preferred package manager:

```plaintext
npx expo install logrocket
```

or

```plaintext
yarn add logrocket
```

This command installs the core `logrocket` package. You'll also want to install the React Native SDK (even though we're using Expo):

```plaintext
npx expo install @logrocket/react-native
```

or

```plaintext
yarn add @logrocket/react-native
```

### 2. Initialize LogRocket in Your App

Now, initialize LogRocket in your app's entry point (usually `App.js` or `App.tsx`). It's best to do this as early as possible in the application lifecycle.

```plaintext
// App.js or App.tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import LogRocket from 'logrocket'
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen'

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function prepare() {
      try {
        // Keep the splash screen visible while we fetch resources
        await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()

        // Initialize LogRocket *before* any other code that might throw errors
        LogRocket.init('your-logrocket-app-id') // Replace with your LogRocket app ID
        LogRocket.getSessionURL((sessionURL) => {
          console.log(`LogRocket session URL = ${sessionURL}`)
        })
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(e)
      } finally {
        // Tell the application to render
        await SplashScreen.hideAsync()
      }
    }

    prepare()
  }, [])

  return (
    // Your app's components here
    // ...
    <div>
      <h1>My Expo App</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Important:** Replace `"your-logrocket-app-id"` with your actual LogRocket application ID. You can find this ID in your LogRocket dashboard under the "Settings" tab.

**Explanation:**

- We import the `LogRocket` module.
- The `useEffect` hook ensures that the LogRocket initialization happens after the component has mounted. Critically, we're doing this _before_ rendering any app UI, increasing the chance we capture startup errors.
- `LogRocket.init('your-logrocket-app-id')` initializes LogRocket with your application ID.
- `LogRocket.getSessionURL` retrieves the URL of the current user session. Logging this to the console during development allows you to quickly access the LogRocket session for debugging.
- We utilize `expo-splash-screen` to ensure LogRocket is initialized _before_ the splash screen is hidden and the main application UI is rendered. This minimizes the risk of missing early initialization errors.

### 3. Identify Users (Optional but Recommended)

To get the most out of LogRocket, identify your users. This allows you to track individual user sessions and correlate errors with specific user accounts. You can identify users using the `LogRocket.identify()` method:

```plaintext
import LogRocket from 'logrocket'

function identifyUser(userId, userData) {
  LogRocket.identify(userId, {
    name: userData.name,
    email: userData.email,
    // Add any other relevant user data
  })
}

// Example Usage (replace with your actual authentication logic)
// Assuming you have a function `getCurrentUser()` that returns the logged-in user
const currentUser = { id: 'user123', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' }

identifyUser(currentUser.id, currentUser)
```

**Explanation:**

- `LogRocket.identify(userId, userData)` associates the current session with the specified user ID and user data.
- The `userId` is a unique identifier for the user (e.g., a database ID).
- `userData` is an object containing additional information about the user, such as their name, email, or any other relevant details.

### 4. Capture Custom Logs and Events

You can use LogRocket to capture custom logs and events to provide more context to your sessions. This is useful for tracking specific user actions or debugging custom logic.

```plaintext
import LogRocket from 'logrocket'

function trackButtonClick(buttonName) {
  LogRocket.track('button-click', {
    buttonName: buttonName,
  })
}

function logInfoMessage(message) {
  LogRocket.log(message)
}

// Example Usage
trackButtonClick('Submit Button')
logInfoMessage('User successfully submitted the form.')
```

**Explanation:**

- `LogRocket.track(eventName, eventProperties)` tracks a custom event with a specific name and properties.
- `LogRocket.log(message)` logs a custom message to the LogRocket session.

### 5. Configure Redux Integration (If Applicable)

If your Expo app uses Redux for state management, LogRocket provides a convenient integration to record Redux actions and state changes. First install the redux middleware package:

```plaintext
npx expo install @logrocket/redux
```

or

```plaintext
yarn add @logrocket/redux
```

Then configure the middleware in your Redux store:

```plaintext
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import { LogRocket } from 'logrocket'
import createLogRocketMiddleware from '@logrocket/redux'
import rootReducer from './reducers' // Replace with your root reducer

const logRocketMiddleware = createLogRocketMiddleware()

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(logRocketMiddleware))

export default store
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `createLogRocketMiddleware` from the `@logrocket/redux` package.
- We create a new middleware instance using `createLogRocketMiddleware()`.
- We add the `logRocketMiddleware` to the Redux middleware chain using `applyMiddleware()`.

With this setup, LogRocket will automatically record all Redux actions and state changes, providing valuable insights into the application's state during user sessions.

### 6. Handle Errors Gracefully

Implement error boundaries in your React Native components to catch errors and prevent your app from crashing. Use `LogRocket.captureException()` to log any caught exceptions to LogRocket.

```plaintext
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import LogRocket from 'logrocket'

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false }
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true }
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    LogRocket.captureException(error, { extra: errorInfo }) // Log the error to LogRocket
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary
```

**Explanation:**

- The `ErrorBoundary` component catches any JavaScript errors that occur within its child components.
- `LogRocket.captureException(error, {extra: errorInfo})` logs the error and additional error information to LogRocket.

Wrap any components that might throw errors with the `ErrorBoundary` component:

```plaintext
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundary'

function MyComponent() {
  return <ErrorBoundary>{/* Your component logic here */}</ErrorBoundary>
}
```

### 7. Expo Configuration (app.json/app.config.js)

While the previous steps cover the core functionality, it's crucial to configure your Expo project properly for optimal LogRocket performance, particularly concerning source maps. Expo handles source map generation automatically, and LogRocket can use these to deobfuscate your code and provide readable stack traces.

Ensure that the following are set correctly in your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

- **`name`:** Your app's name. Crucial for identifying your application in the LogRocket dashboard.
- **`slug`:** A URL-friendly name for your app.
- **`version`:** The current version of your app. This is very important for matching errors to the correct source code. Make sure to increment the version number with each release.
- **`runtimeVersion`:** (Recommended). Specifying a runtime version helps LogRocket accurately map errors back to the appropriate source code versions, especially after Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. You can use a `policy` of `sdkVersion` which ties the runtime version to the Expo SDK version.

Example (`app.json`):

```plaintext
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyAppName",
    "slug": "my-app-slug",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "runtimeVersion": {
      "policy": "sdkVersion"
    },
    "sdkVersion": "49.0.0"
    // ... other configurations
  }
}
```

**Important Considerations for Source Maps:**

- **Production Builds:** Ensure that your production builds include source maps. Expo CLI typically handles this automatically.
- **LogRocket Upload:** LogRocket should automatically be able to ingest source maps produced by Expo, but it's worth checking in the LogRocket settings to make sure this is enabled.
- **Version Control:** Keep track of your source maps and associate them with specific application versions. This is essential for debugging issues in older versions of your app.

### 8. Testing Your Integration

After completing the integration steps, test your LogRocket setup thoroughly.

- **Trigger an Error:** Intentionally introduce an error in your app (e.g., by referencing an undefined variable). Verify that the error is captured and displayed in the LogRocket dashboard.
- **Record a Session:** Navigate through your app and perform various actions. Then, check the LogRocket dashboard to see if your session has been recorded correctly.
- **Verify User Identification:** Log in to your app and verify that the correct user information is being sent to LogRocket.
- **Check Logs and Events:** Trigger your custom logs and events and ensure they are being recorded in LogRocket.

### Advanced Configurations and Best Practices

- **Data Scrubbing:** LogRocket allows you to scrub sensitive data from your recordings to protect user privacy. You can configure data scrubbing rules in your LogRocket settings.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to configure your LogRocket application ID and other sensitive settings. This is especially important when working in a team environment.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Explore LogRocket's performance monitoring features to identify slow-loading components or API calls. This can help you optimize your app for speed and responsiveness.
- **Custom Metrics:** Track custom metrics, such as the number of users who completed a specific task, to gain deeper insights into user behavior.
- **Integration with Other Tools:** LogRocket integrates with other popular tools, such as Jira, Slack, and GitHub, allowing you to streamline your workflow.

## Troubleshooting

- **LogRocket Not Initializing:** Double-check that you have correctly installed the LogRocket SDK and initialized it with your application ID. Also, ensure that you are initializing LogRocket as early as possible in your app's lifecycle. Verify that `react-native-reanimated` is installed if using the Expo SDK version >=49
- **Errors Not Being Captured:** Ensure that you have implemented error boundaries and are using `LogRocket.captureException()` to log caught exceptions. Also, verify that your source maps are being generated correctly and that LogRocket can access them.
- **Session Recordings Not Working:** Check your LogRocket settings to ensure that session recording is enabled. Also, make sure that your app is not blocking LogRocket's tracking script.
- **User Identification Issues:** Verify that you are using the correct user ID and that the user data is being sent correctly to LogRocket.
