# Struct vs Class: Understanding the Key Differences (With Code Examples)

Choosing the right data structure is crucial for efficient and maintainable code. Two fundamental building blocks in many programming languages are **structs** and **classes**. While they might seem similar at first glance, understanding their core differences is essential for making informed decisions about how to organize your data and logic. This article delves into the nuances of structs and classes, highlighting their differences in terms of memory management, inheritance, value semantics, and reference semantics, and providing practical code examples to illustrate these concepts.

## What are Structs and Classes?

Both structs and classes are used to define custom data types, allowing you to group related data and functionality together. They act as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of these data types. They both allow you to define members which can be data (fields/attributes) or behaviour (methods/functions).

## Key Differences Between Structs and Classes

The primary differences lie in the following areas:

1.  **Value Types vs. Reference Types:**

    - **Structs:** Structs are _value types_. This means that when you assign a struct to a new variable or pass it as an argument to a function, a _copy_ of the entire struct is created. Changes made to the copy do not affect the original struct. Structs are typically allocated on the stack, which generally makes memory access faster.

    - **Classes:** Classes are _reference types_. When you assign a class object to a new variable, you're only copying the _reference_ (pointer) to the object in memory. Both variables then point to the same object. Changes made through one reference will be reflected when accessing the object through any other reference. Classes are typically allocated on the heap, which requires more overhead for allocation and deallocation.

2.  **Memory Allocation:**

    - **Structs:** Generally allocated on the _stack_. This means memory allocation is fast and automatic. When the struct goes out of scope, the memory is automatically reclaimed.

    - **Classes:** Typically allocated on the _heap_. Memory allocation on the heap is more flexible and allows for dynamic memory management, but it also requires more overhead. In languages with garbage collection (like Java and C#), the garbage collector reclaims the memory when the object is no longer referenced. In languages without garbage collection (like C++), the programmer is responsible for deallocating the memory using `delete`.

3.  **Inheritance:**

    - **Structs:** In many languages (like C# and Java), structs _cannot_ inherit from other structs or classes. This limitation reinforces their role as simple data containers. In some cases, they can implement interfaces.

    - **Classes:** Classes support _inheritance_. This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses inherit properties and methods from their parent classes (base classes). Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows you to model "is-a" relationships between objects.

4.  **Default Constructor:**

    - **Structs:** In some languages (like C#), structs have a _default constructor_ that initializes all fields to their default values (e.g., 0 for integers, `null` for strings). You cannot define a parameterless constructor in C# structs.

    - **Classes:** Classes can have a _default constructor_ (a constructor with no parameters) defined explicitly. If you don't define a constructor, the compiler will often generate a default constructor implicitly.

5.  **Mutability:**

    - **Structs:** Since structs are value types, modifying a struct generally means creating a new copy. This can impact performance if the struct is large and frequently modified. However, in C#, you can create read-only structs using the `readonly` keyword, enhancing immutability.

    - **Classes:** Classes, being reference types, are inherently mutable. Modifying the state of a class object will affect all references to that object. Immutability can be achieved by making the class's properties read-only and providing methods to create new instances with modified values (like the Builder pattern).

## Code Examples

Let's illustrate these differences with code examples in C++, C#, and Java.

### C++

```plaintext
#include <iostream>

// Struct example
struct PointStruct {
    int x;
    int y;
};

// Class example
class PointClass {
public:
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    // Struct demonstration
    PointStruct p1 = {10, 20};
    PointStruct p2 = p1; // Copy created
    p2.x = 30;

    std::cout << "Struct: p1.x = " << p1.x << ", p2.x = " << p2.x << std::endl; // p1.x = 10, p2.x = 30

    // Class demonstration
    PointClass pc1;
    pc1.x = 10;
    pc1.y = 20;

    PointClass* pc2 = &pc1; // Reference created
    pc2->x = 30;

    std::cout << "Class: pc1.x = " << pc1.x << ", pc2->x = " << pc2->x << std::endl; // pc1.x = 30, pc2->x = 30

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation (C++):**

- In the struct example, assigning `p1` to `p2` creates a _copy_ of the struct. Modifying `p2.x` doesn't affect `p1.x`.
- In the class example, `pc2` is a _pointer_ to `pc1`. Modifying `pc2->x` _does_ affect `pc1.x` because they both point to the same memory location. C++ does not have garbage collection, so you need to handle memory management carefully, especially for class instances created dynamically using `new`.

### C#

```plaintext
using System;

// Struct example
struct PointStruct
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }
}

// Class example
class PointClass
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }
}

public class Example
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Struct demonstration
        PointStruct p1 = new PointStruct { X = 10, Y = 20 };
        PointStruct p2 = p1; // Copy created
        p2.X = 30;

        Console.WriteLine($"Struct: p1.X = {p1.X}, p2.X = {p2.X}"); // p1.X = 10, p2.X = 30

        // Class demonstration
        PointClass pc1 = new PointClass { X = 10, Y = 20 };
        PointClass pc2 = pc1; // Reference created
        pc2.X = 30;

        Console.WriteLine($"Class: pc1.X = {pc1.X}, pc2.X = {pc2.X}"); // pc1.X = 30, pc2.X = 30
    }
}
```

**Explanation (C#):**

- The C# example clearly shows the difference between value types and reference types. The struct `p2` is a copy of `p1`, whereas `pc2` is a reference to the same object as `pc1`. C# has garbage collection, which simplifies memory management for classes.

### Java

```plaintext
// Struct equivalent (using record, introduced in Java 16)
record PointRecord(int x, int y) {}


// Class example
class PointClass {
    public int x;
    public int y;

    public PointClass(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public PointClass(PointClass other) { // Copy constructor
        this.x = other.x;
        this.y = other.y;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Record demonstration (struct-like behavior)
        PointRecord p1 = new PointRecord(10, 20);
        PointRecord p2 = p1;  // Copy of the record (value semantics)
        p2 = new PointRecord(30, p2.y()); // Records are immutable, so create a new instance

        System.out.println("Record: p1.x = " + p1.x() + ", p2.x = " + p2.x()); // Record: p1.x = 10, p2.x = 30


        // Class demonstration
        PointClass pc1 = new PointClass(10, 20);
        PointClass pc2 = pc1; // Reference created
        pc2.x = 30;

        System.out.println("Class: pc1.x = " + pc1.x + ", pc2.x = " + pc2.x); // Class: pc1.x = 30, pc2.x = 30

        //Demonstrate class copy using copy constructor
        PointClass pc3 = new PointClass(10,20);
        PointClass pc4 = new PointClass(pc3); // deep copy using copy constructor
        pc4.x = 40;
        System.out.println("Class deep copy: pc3.x = " + pc3.x + ", pc4.x = " + pc4.x); //Class deep copy: pc3.x = 10, pc4.x = 40

    }
}
```

**Explanation (Java):**

- Java doesn't have structs in the same way as C++ or C#. However, `record` (introduced in Java 16) provides a similar concept of a simple, immutable data container with value semantics. Assigning one record to another creates a copy. Records are implicitly final and immutable.
- The class example demonstrates the reference semantics of classes in Java. When `pc2` is assigned `pc1`, they both point to the same object. Changing `pc2.x` also changes `pc1.x`.
- The Java example uses a copy constructor to create a _deep copy_ of a class. `pc4` is a separate object from `pc3`, so modifying `pc4.x` does _not_ affect `pc3.x`.

## When to Use Structs vs. Classes

Here's a general guideline for when to choose structs or classes:

- **Use Structs When:**

  - Representing small, simple data structures. Examples include points, rectangles, colors, or currency amounts.
  - You want value semantics (copying instead of referencing).
  - You want to minimize heap allocation overhead.
  - Immutability is desired or beneficial.
  - Performance is critical, and the data structure is frequently accessed.

- **Use Classes When:**

  - Representing more complex objects with behavior (methods).
  - You need inheritance.
  - You want reference semantics (sharing data between different parts of the application).
  - Object identity is important.
  - You need to manage complex object lifetimes.
  - Polymorphism is required.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between structs and classes is crucial for writing efficient and well-structured code. Structs are lightweight, value-based data structures suitable for representing simple data, while classes are more powerful and flexible, providing inheritance, reference semantics, and object-oriented capabilities. By considering these differences and following the guidelines outlined above, you can choose the appropriate data structure for your specific needs and write cleaner, more maintainable code. The choice is not always clear cut and depends on the specific requirements of your application. Analyze your data and choose the type that best fits its use case.
