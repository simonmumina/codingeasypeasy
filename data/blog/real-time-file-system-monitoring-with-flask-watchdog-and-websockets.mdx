# Real-Time File System Monitoring with Flask, Watchdog, and WebSockets

This blog post explores how to build a real-time file system monitoring application using Python, leveraging the power of Flask, Watchdog, and WebSockets. We'll create a system that watches a specified directory for changes and instantly notifies connected clients via a web browser. This is a valuable tool for various applications, including:

- **Development environments:** Automatically reload application servers or trigger build processes on file changes.
- **Security monitoring:** Detect unauthorized modifications to critical files in real-time.
- **Content management systems:** Update website content instantly when files are changed.
- **Log aggregation and analysis:** Monitor log files for specific patterns and generate alerts.

Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Python 3.6 or higher is recommended.
- **pip:** Python package installer.

## Installing the Required Packages

We need to install the necessary Python packages: Flask, Watchdog, and Flask-SocketIO. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```plaintext
pip install Flask watchdog flask-socketio
```

- **Flask:** A micro web framework for building web applications.
- **Watchdog:** A library for monitoring file system events.
- **Flask-SocketIO:** Provides WebSocket integration for Flask applications.

## Project Structure

Let's create the following project structure:

```
my_watcher/
├── app.py          # Flask application
├── templates/      # HTML templates
│   └── index.html
├── static/         # Static files (CSS, JavaScript)
│   └── script.js
└── monitored_directory/  # The directory to watch
    └── (optional files)
```

Create these directories and files in your project. We will populate them with code in the following sections.

## Creating the Flask Application (app.py)

The core of our application is the `app.py` file. Here's the code:

```plaintext
import os
import time
import threading
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_socketio import SocketIO
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret!'  # Change this in production!
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")

# Directory to monitor
WATCH_DIRECTORY = "monitored_directory"

# Ensure the monitored directory exists
if not os.path.exists(WATCH_DIRECTORY):
    os.makedirs(WATCH_DIRECTORY)


class FileSystemEventHandlerCustom(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_any_event(self, event):
        event_type = event.event_type
        src_path = event.src_path

        # Extract filename for easier understanding
        filename = os.path.basename(src_path)
        if filename == '': #it's a directory
            filename = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(src_path))


        print(f"Event type: {event_type}  path : {src_path}")
        socketio.emit('file_change', {'message': f'File {filename} {event_type} at {src_path}'}) # Include filename

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

def start_monitoring():
    event_handler = FileSystemEventHandlerCustom()
    observer = Observer()
    observer.schedule(event_handler, WATCH_DIRECTORY, recursive=True)
    observer.start()

    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        observer.stop()
    observer.join()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Start the file system monitoring in a separate thread
    threading.Thread(target=start_monitoring, daemon=True).start()
    socketio.run(app, debug=True)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import Necessary Libraries:** Imports Flask, SocketIO, Watchdog, and `os` for file system operations.
2.  **Flask Initialization:** Creates a Flask app and initializes Flask-SocketIO. The `cors_allowed_origins="*"` allows cross-origin requests. **Important:** For production, restrict this to the specific origins you expect requests from for security.
3.  **`WATCH_DIRECTORY`:** Defines the directory to monitor. The code also ensures the directory exists.
4.  **`FileSystemEventHandlerCustom`:** A custom event handler that inherits from `FileSystemEventHandler`. The `on_any_event` method is called for any file system event (creation, modification, deletion, etc.). This method extracts the filename for clarity and emits a 'file_change' event to all connected WebSocket clients, including the full path and the type of event.
5.  **`index` Route:** Serves the `index.html` template, which will contain the client-side JavaScript code to handle WebSocket messages.
6.  **`start_monitoring` Function:** This function sets up Watchdog to monitor the `WATCH_DIRECTORY`. It creates an `Observer` and schedules the `FileSystemEventHandlerCustom` to handle events. The `recursive=True` argument ensures that all subdirectories within `WATCH_DIRECTORY` are also monitored. It runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main Flask application.
7.  **Running the Application:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block starts the file system monitoring in a separate thread and then runs the Flask application with SocketIO. `debug=True` enables debugging mode, which is helpful during development.

## Creating the HTML Template (templates/index.html)

This file provides the HTML structure for the client-side application.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>File System Watcher</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>File System Watcher</h1>
    <ul id="events"></ul>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/4.1.3/socket.io.js"></script>
    <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='script.js') }}"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- **HTML Structure:** Basic HTML structure with a title and a `ul` element to display events.
- **CSS Link:** Links to the `style.css` file for styling.
- **Socket.IO Script:** Includes the Socket.IO client-side library from a CDN.
- **`script.js` Link:** Links to the `script.js` file, which will contain the JavaScript code to handle WebSocket messages.

## Creating the JavaScript File (static/script.js)

This file contains the JavaScript code to connect to the WebSocket server and display file change events.

```plaintext
const socket = io()
const eventsList = document.getElementById('events')

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket server')
})

socket.on('file_change', (data) => {
  console.log('Received file change event:', data)
  const listItem = document.createElement('li')
  listItem.textContent = data.message
  eventsList.appendChild(listItem)
})

socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from WebSocket server')
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Socket.IO Connection:** Establishes a WebSocket connection to the server using `io()`.
2.  **`connect` Event:** Logs a message to the console when the connection is established.
3.  **`file_change` Event:** Listens for the `file_change` event from the server. When an event is received, it creates a new `li` element with the event message and appends it to the `eventsList` element.
4.  **`disconnect` Event:** Logs a message to the console when the connection is disconnected.

## (Optional) Creating a CSS File (static/style.css)

This file can be used to style the appearance of the application. A simple example:

```plaintext
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  margin: 20px;
}

#events {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}

#events li {
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}
```

## Running the Application

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the `my_watcher` directory.
3.  Run the command: `python app.py`

The application will start, and you should see output similar to:

```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Click CTRL+C to quit
```

4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Testing the Application

1.  Open the `monitored_directory`.
2.  Create, modify, or delete files within the directory.
3.  Observe the changes reflected in real-time on the web page. Each change will appear as a new entry in the list.

## Conclusion

This blog post demonstrated how to create a real-time file system monitoring application using Flask, Watchdog, and WebSockets. This combination provides a powerful and efficient way to track file changes and trigger actions accordingly. Remember to adapt the code to your specific needs, such as filtering events based on file types or integrating with other services. Consider the security implications, particularly regarding CORS settings in production environments. Happy coding!
