# Customize Nginx Access and Error Logs: A Comprehensive Guide

Nginx is a powerful and versatile web server and reverse proxy, crucial for delivering web content efficiently. Proper logging is essential for monitoring its performance, debugging issues, and analyzing traffic patterns. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of customizing Nginx access and error logs, enabling you to tailor them to your specific needs.

## Why Customize Nginx Logs?

The default Nginx logs provide a basic level of information. Customizing them offers several advantages:

*   **Granular Information:**  Include specific details relevant to your application, such as request processing time, upstream server details, and custom variables.
*   **Improved Debugging:** Tailor error logs to provide context around errors, making troubleshooting easier.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Capture data to analyze website performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource usage.
*   **Security Monitoring:**  Log suspicious activities, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Compliance:**  Meet regulatory requirements for data retention and auditing.
*   **Integration with Monitoring Tools:** Format logs for seamless integration with log management platforms like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, or Graylog.

## Understanding Nginx Logs

Nginx uses two primary types of logs:

*   **Access Logs:**  Record information about every request served by the server, including client IP address, request URL, status code, and user agent. These logs are invaluable for traffic analysis, security monitoring, and identifying popular content.

*   **Error Logs:** Record errors and warnings encountered by Nginx, such as configuration issues, upstream server failures, or client-side errors.  These logs are crucial for debugging problems and ensuring the stability of your web server.

## Configuring Nginx Logs

Nginx log configuration is done within the `nginx.conf` file, typically located in `/etc/nginx/` or `/usr/local/nginx/conf/`. The configuration is structured in blocks: `http`, `server`, and `location`.  You can define log directives within these blocks, inheriting them from parent blocks.

### Access Log Configuration

The `access_log` directive is used to configure access logs.  Its syntax is:

```nginx
access_log path [format [buffer=size] [gzip[=level]] [flush=time] [if=condition]];
```

*   **`path`:** The full path to the log file.
*   **`format`:** The name of the log format. If omitted, the `combined` format is used by default.
*   **`buffer=size`:** Specifies the buffer size for writing logs to disk. Using a buffer can improve performance.
*   **`gzip[=level]`:** Compresses the log file using gzip. The `level` parameter specifies the compression level (1-9).
*   **`flush=time`:**  Specifies the interval after which the buffer is flushed to disk, regardless of its size.
*   **`if=condition`:**  Logs only requests that match the specified condition.

**Example:**

```nginx
http {
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
}
```

This configuration defines a log format named `main` and uses it to log access requests to `/var/log/nginx/access.log`.

### Error Log Configuration

The `error_log` directive configures error logs.  Its syntax is:

```nginx
error_log path level;
```

*   **`path`:** The full path to the error log file.
*   **`level`:**  The severity level of messages to be logged. Valid levels are: `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warn`, `error`, `crit`, `alert`, and `emerg`.  Messages at the specified level and higher will be logged.

**Example:**

```nginx
http {
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log  error;
}
```

This configuration logs error messages with a severity level of `error` or higher to `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.

## Defining Custom Log Formats

The `log_format` directive defines custom log formats.  Its syntax is:

```nginx
log_format name string [string ...];
```

*   **`name`:** The name of the log format.
*   **`string`:**  A string containing variables and literal text that defines the log format.

**Available Variables:**

Nginx provides a wide range of variables that you can use in log formats. Some of the most common include:

*   `$remote_addr`: Client IP address.
*   `$remote_user`:  Authenticated user (if applicable).
*   `$time_local`: Local time.
*   `$request`: The full request line.
*   `$status`:  HTTP status code.
*   `$body_bytes_sent`: Number of bytes sent in the response body.
*   `$http_referer`:  Referer URL.
*   `$http_user_agent`: User agent string.
*   `$http_x_forwarded_for`:  Value of the X-Forwarded-For header.
*   `$request_time`: Request processing time in seconds with milliseconds resolution.
*   `$upstream_addr`: Address of the upstream server.
*   `$upstream_status`: HTTP status code returned by the upstream server.
*   `$upstream_response_time`: Time taken to receive a response from the upstream server.
*   `$request_id`: Unique ID assigned to each request by Nginx.  Requires `ngx_http_reqid_module`.
*   `$host`: Request Host header field.
*   `$server_name`:  The name of the virtual server processing the request.
*   `$request_uri`: The full URI requested.
*   `$args`: The query string portion of the URI.
*   `$bytes_sent`: The total bytes sent (headers + body).
*   `$connection`: The connection number.
*   `$connection_requests`: The total number of requests made through this connection.

**Example: A Detailed Log Format**

```nginx
http {
    log_format  detailed  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                       '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                       '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for" '
                       'request_time=$request_time upstream_addr=$upstream_addr '
                       'upstream_status=$upstream_status upstream_response_time=$upstream_response_time '
                       'request_id=$request_id server_name=$server_name';

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  detailed;
}
```

This example creates a log format named `detailed` that includes various useful variables for debugging and analysis.  Remember to enable the `ngx_http_reqid_module` module if you wish to use `$request_id`. In Ubuntu/Debian, this usually involves installing the `nginx-extras` package instead of the standard `nginx` package.  In some cases, you may need to compile Nginx from source with the `--with-http_reqid_module` configuration option.

## Conditional Logging

You can use the `if` parameter in the `access_log` directive to log requests based on certain conditions. This can be useful for filtering out unwanted log entries or logging specific types of requests separately.

**Example: Logging Only 5xx Errors**

```nginx
http {
    map $status $loggable {
        ~^[5]  1;
        default 0;
    }

    access_log  /var/log/nginx/error_access.log combined if=$loggable;
}
```

This example uses the `map` directive to create a variable named `$loggable`.  If the HTTP status code starts with '5' (indicating a 5xx error), `$loggable` is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.  The `access_log` directive then logs only requests where `$loggable` is true.  This allows you to isolate access logs for server errors.

## Logging to Different Files Based on Conditions (Location-Specific Logging)

You can also configure different logging configurations based on the requested location.  This is particularly useful for separating logs for different APIs or application components.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location /api/v1 {
        access_log /var/log/nginx/api_v1_access.log combined;
    }

    location / {
        access_log /var/log/nginx/default_access.log combined;
    }
}
```

In this example, requests to `/api/v1` will be logged to `api_v1_access.log`, while requests to the root `/` or any other non-API location will be logged to `default_access.log`.

## Rotating Logs

Log rotation is essential to prevent log files from growing indefinitely and consuming excessive disk space. Nginx itself doesn't handle log rotation directly. You typically use a separate log rotation utility like `logrotate` (available on most Linux distributions).

**Example `logrotate` Configuration ( `/etc/logrotate.d/nginx` ):**

```
/var/log/nginx/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    missingok
    notifempty
    delaycompress
    compress
    postrotate
        /usr/sbin/nginx -s reload >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    endscript
}
```

This configuration rotates Nginx log files daily, keeps 7 days of logs, compresses older logs, and reloads Nginx after rotation to ensure new logs are written to the new files.  The `postrotate` script is crucial because Nginx needs to reopen the log files after they have been rotated. Without it, Nginx will continue writing to the old, renamed files.

## Best Practices

*   **Use descriptive log formats:** Choose variables that provide relevant information for your use case.
*   **Implement log rotation:** Prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space.
*   **Consider security:** Avoid logging sensitive data like passwords or API keys. If you *must* log sensitive data for debugging purposes, redact or hash it immediately after logging.
*   **Monitor log volume:**  Excessive logging can impact performance.  Monitor log volume and adjust logging levels as needed.
*   **Use a log management platform:**  For larger deployments, a log management platform can significantly improve log analysis and troubleshooting.
*   **Test your configuration:**  After making changes to your Nginx configuration, always test it using `nginx -t` before reloading the server.

## Conclusion

Customizing Nginx access and error logs is a powerful way to gain valuable insights into your web server's performance, security, and behavior. By defining custom log formats, implementing conditional logging, and using log rotation, you can create a robust logging system tailored to your specific needs.  Remember to test your configuration thoroughly and monitor log volume to ensure optimal performance.
