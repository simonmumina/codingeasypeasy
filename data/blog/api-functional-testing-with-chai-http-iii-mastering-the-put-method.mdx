# API Functional Testing with Chai-HTTP III: Mastering the PUT Method

In the world of API development, ensuring functionality and reliability is paramount. Functional tests play a vital role in verifying that your API endpoints behave as expected, especially when dealing with data modifications. This post continues our series on using Chai-HTTP for functional API testing, diving deep into the `PUT` method. We'll cover the essentials, explore code examples, and discuss best practices for building robust and reliable tests.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js and npm installed:** These are essential for running JavaScript and managing dependencies.
- **A running API:** You'll need an API to test against. For demonstration purposes, you can use a simple mock API like JSONPlaceholder or set up your own using Express.js or similar framework.
- **Mocha:** A popular JavaScript test framework.
- **Chai:** An assertion library.
- **Chai-HTTP:** A Chai plugin for making HTTP requests.

If you haven't already, install these dependencies using npm:

```plaintext
npm install mocha chai chai-http --save-dev
```

## Understanding the PUT Method

The `PUT` method is used to _completely replace_ an existing resource with the data provided in the request body. This is different from `PATCH`, which is used for partial updates. When using `PUT`, the request body should contain a complete representation of the resource.

Key characteristics of the `PUT` method:

- **Idempotent:** Making multiple identical `PUT` requests should have the same effect as making a single request.
- **Replaces the entire resource:** The data sent in the request body will completely replace the existing resource at the specified URI.
- **Requires resource identification:** The URI (endpoint) must identify the resource to be updated.

## Setting up Your Test Environment

First, create a `test` directory in your project root and a file named `put.test.js` (or any name you prefer). In this file, we'll set up our testing environment:

```javascript
// test/put.test.js
const chai = require('chai')
const chaiHttp = require('chai-http')
const app = require('../app') // Replace with your application entry point
const expect = chai.expect

chai.use(chaiHttp)

describe('PUT API Tests', () => {
  // Before each test, you might want to set up some initial data or state
  beforeEach((done) => {
    // Example: Clear the database or reset the API state
    done()
  })

  // After each test, you might want to clean up
  afterEach((done) => {
    // Example: Remove any test data that was created
    done()
  })

  // ... Tests will go here ...
})
```

Remember to replace `require('../app')` with the correct path to your application's entry point. The `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks are optional, but useful for managing test data and ensuring a clean testing environment.

## Writing Your First PUT Test

Let's write a test to verify that we can successfully update a resource using the `PUT` method. Assume we have an API endpoint `/items/{id}` that allows us to update an item with a given ID.

```javascript
it('should update an existing item', (done) => {
  const itemId = 1 // Replace with a valid item ID in your test environment
  const updatedItem = {
    id: itemId,
    name: 'Updated Item Name',
    description: 'This is an updated description',
  }

  chai
    .request(app)
    .put(`/items/${itemId}`)
    .send(updatedItem)
    .end((err, res) => {
      expect(res).to.have.status(200) // Or 204 if no content is returned
      expect(res.body).to.be.an('object')
      expect(res.body.id).to.equal(itemId)
      expect(res.body.name).to.equal(updatedItem.name)
      expect(res.body.description).to.equal(updatedItem.description)
      done()
    })
})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`itemId`:** We define the ID of the item we want to update. This should correspond to a valid resource in your API.
2.  **`updatedItem`:** This object represents the _complete_ updated data for the item. Note that we are sending the ID as part of the payload, although some APIs may not require this, relying solely on the URL parameter. It's important to adhere to your API's specification.
3.  **`chai.request(app).put(...)`:** We use Chai-HTTP to make a `PUT` request to the `/items/${itemId}` endpoint.
4.  **`.send(updatedItem)`:** We send the `updatedItem` object as the request body. Chai-HTTP automatically serializes the object to JSON.
5.  **`.end((err, res) => { ... })`:** This is the callback function that executes after the request completes.
6.  **`expect(res).to.have.status(200);`:** We assert that the response status code is 200 (OK), indicating a successful update. Some APIs may return a 204 (No Content) if the update is successful but there's no body in the response. Choose the appropriate status code based on your API's behavior.
7.  **`expect(res.body).to.be.an('object');`:** We assert that the response body is a JSON object.
8.  **`expect(res.body.id).to.equal(itemId);`:** We assert that the `id` property in the response body matches the `itemId` we sent in the request.
9.  **`expect(res.body.name).to.equal(updatedItem.name);`:** We assert that the `name` property in the response body matches the updated name.
10. **`expect(res.body.description).to.equal(updatedItem.description);`:** We assert that the `description` property in the response body matches the updated description.
11. **`done();`:** We call `done()` to signal to Mocha that the asynchronous test is complete.

## Testing for Error Scenarios

It's equally important to test for error scenarios. Here are some common error scenarios to consider when testing the `PUT` method:

### 1. Resource Not Found (404)

Test what happens when you try to update a resource that doesn't exist.

```javascript
it('should return 404 if the item does not exist', (done) => {
  const nonExistentItemId = 9999 // Replace with an ID that doesn't exist
  const updatedItem = {
    id: nonExistentItemId,
    name: 'Nonexistent Item',
    description: 'This item does not exist',
  }

  chai
    .request(app)
    .put(`/items/${nonExistentItemId}`)
    .send(updatedItem)
    .end((err, res) => {
      expect(res).to.have.status(404)
      done()
    })
})
```

### 2. Invalid Request Body (400)

Test what happens when you send an invalid request body. This could include missing required fields, invalid data types, or exceeding maximum length constraints.

```javascript
it('should return 400 if the request body is invalid', (done) => {
  const itemId = 1 // Replace with a valid item ID
  const invalidItem = {
    // Missing required 'name' field
    description: 'Invalid item',
  }

  chai
    .request(app)
    .put(`/items/${itemId}`)
    .send(invalidItem)
    .end((err, res) => {
      expect(res).to.have.status(400)
      done()
    })
})
```

### 3. Conflict (409)

If your API enforces unique constraints, test what happens when you try to update a resource with data that would violate those constraints.

```javascript
it('should return 409 if the update conflicts with existing data (e.g., duplicate name)', (done) => {
  const itemId = 1 // Replace with a valid item ID
  const conflictingItem = {
    id: itemId,
    name: 'Existing Item Name', // Replace with a name that already exists
    description: 'Conflicting item',
  }

  chai
    .request(app)
    .put(`/items/${itemId}`)
    .send(conflictingItem)
    .end((err, res) => {
      expect(res).to.have.status(409)
      done()
    })
})
```

## Best Practices for PUT Method Testing

- **Test all possible scenarios:** Cover both success and failure cases.
- **Validate the entire resource:** Ensure that all properties of the resource are correctly updated.
- **Test with valid and invalid data:** Test the API's validation logic by sending both valid and invalid data in the request body.
- **Use meaningful test names:** Clear and descriptive test names make it easier to understand the purpose of each test.
- **Clean up after tests:** Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to set up and tear down test data.
- **Consider using data-driven testing:** If you have many similar tests with different data sets, use data-driven testing to avoid code duplication.
- **Verify Idempotency:** Run the same PUT request multiple times and verify the state of the resource is the same after each request.

## Running Your Tests

To run your tests, add a script to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha"
  }
}
```

Then, run the tests from your terminal:

```plaintext
npm test
```

Mocha will execute your tests and report the results.
