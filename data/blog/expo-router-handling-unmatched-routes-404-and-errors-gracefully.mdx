# Expo Router: Handling Unmatched Routes (404) and Errors Gracefully

Expo Router is a powerful file-based routing library for React Native applications built with Expo. It simplifies navigation and provides a familiar developer experience for those accustomed to frameworks like Next.js. However, like any routing system, it's crucial to handle situations where users navigate to non-existent routes (404 errors) or when unexpected errors occur within your application. This blog post will guide you through implementing robust 404 pages and effective error handling within your Expo Router app.

## Why is Handling 404s and Errors Important?

- **Improved User Experience:** A generic error message or a broken page can frustrate users and lead them to abandon your app. Providing informative 404 pages and graceful error handling helps retain users and improves their overall experience.
- **Professionalism:** Handling errors well demonstrates attention to detail and professionalism, enhancing your app's credibility.
- **Debugging and Maintenance:** Proper error handling provides valuable insights into potential issues within your application, making debugging and maintenance easier.
- **Avoiding Crashes:** Catching and handling errors gracefully can prevent your app from crashing unexpectedly, which is particularly critical in mobile environments.

## Implementing a 404 (Not Found) Page

Expo Router doesn't automatically provide a default 404 page. You need to create one yourself. The typical convention is to create a file named `_missing.js` or `_missing.tsx` in your `app` directory (or any subdirectory where you want the 404 page to apply).

Here's an example of a simple 404 page using React Native components and Expo Router's `Link` component:

```jsx filename="app/_missing.js"
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native'
import { Link } from 'expo-router'

export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>404 - Page Not Found</Text>
      <Text style={styles.message}>Oops! The page you're looking for doesn't exist.</Text>
      <Link href="/" asChild>
        <Button title="Go to Home" />
      </Link>
    </View>
  )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  message: {
    fontSize: 16,
    textAlign: 'center',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `_missing.js`: This file name tells Expo Router that this component should be rendered when no other route matches the requested path.
- `Link href="/"`: This uses the `Link` component from Expo Router to create a navigation link back to the home page. Using `asChild` allows you to wrap the `Button` component with the `Link` for styling purposes.
- `styles`: A simple StyleSheet is used to style the 404 page.

**Customizing the 404 Page:**

You can customize the 404 page to match your app's design and provide more helpful information. Consider including:

- A search bar to help users find what they're looking for.
- A list of popular links or featured content.
- A contact form or email address for users to report broken links.

**Applying 404 Pages to Specific Subdirectories:**

You can create `_missing.js` files within specific subdirectories of your `app` directory to provide different 404 pages for different sections of your app. For example, you might have a different 404 page for your "blog" section compared to your "product" section. Expo Router will search for the closest `_missing.js` file in the directory hierarchy to render.

## Implementing Error Boundaries

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole component tree. Expo Router integrates seamlessly with React's error boundary concept.

Here's an example of how to create a simple error boundary component:

```jsx filename="components/ErrorBoundary.js"
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native'
import { Link } from 'expo-router'

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false, error: null, errorInfo: null }
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true }
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    console.error('Caught an error: ', error, errorInfo)
    this.setState({ error: error, errorInfo: errorInfo })
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text style={styles.title}>Something went wrong!</Text>
          <Text style={styles.message}>{this.state.error && this.state.error.toString()}</Text>
          <Link href="/" asChild>
            <Button
              title="Go to Home"
              onPress={() => this.setState({ hasError: false, error: null, errorInfo: null })}
            />
          </Link>
        </View>
      )
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 10,
  },
  message: {
    fontSize: 16,
    textAlign: 'center',
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
})

export default ErrorBoundary
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ErrorBoundary` Component:** This component wraps the parts of your app that you want to protect with error handling.
- **`getDerivedStateFromError(error)`:** This static method is called when an error is thrown in a descendant component. It updates the state to indicate that an error has occurred. Crucially, this method _must_ be static.
- **`componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo)`:** This method is called after an error is thrown in a descendant component. It receives the error and error info, allowing you to log the error to a service like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics. You can also update the state to store the error information for display in the fallback UI.
- **Fallback UI:** If `this.state.hasError` is true, the component renders a fallback UI, displaying a friendly message and optionally the error message itself.
- **`this.props.children`:** If no error occurs, the component simply renders its children.

**Using the Error Boundary:**

Wrap your components with the `ErrorBoundary` to catch errors within them. You can wrap individual components or entire sections of your app, depending on the granularity of error handling you require.

```jsx filename="app/my-component.js"
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'

function MyComponent() {
  // Simulate an error
  const shouldError = true

  if (shouldError) {
    throw new Error('This is a simulated error!')
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is MyComponent</Text>
    </View>
  )
}

export default function MyComponentWrapper() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  )
}
```

**Benefits of Using Error Boundaries:**

- **Prevents App Crashes:** Error boundaries prevent a single error from crashing your entire application.
- **Provides a Graceful Fallback:** Instead of a blank screen or a cryptic error message, error boundaries display a user-friendly fallback UI.
- **Facilitates Error Reporting:** The `componentDidCatch` method allows you to log errors to error reporting services, helping you identify and fix issues.

## Global Error Handling

While Error Boundaries are excellent for handling errors within specific components, you might also want to implement a more global error handling mechanism to catch unhandled exceptions. This is particularly important for errors that occur outside the React component tree.

You can achieve this using `ErrorBoundary` components at the very root of your application or using the `expo-error-boundary` library.

Here's how you can wrap the entire application in the `_layout.js` or `_layout.tsx` file with an `ErrorBoundary`:

```jsx filename="app/_layout.js"
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'
import { Text } from 'react-native'
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'

export default function Layout() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const errorHandler = (e, isFatal) => {
      console.log(e.message)
      if (isFatal) {
        //Do something like show alert or redirect to specific error page
        //Alert.alert(
        //  "Unexpected error occurred",
        //  `Error : ${isFatal ? 'Fatal:' : ''} ${e.name} ${e.message}
        //  We will need to restart the app.`,
        //  [{
        //    text: "Okay"
        //  }]
        //);
      } else {
        console.log('Error occurred')
      }
    }

    global.ErrorUtils.setGlobalHandler(errorHandler)
  }, [])

  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <Stack>{/* Define your routes here */}</Stack>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`_layout.js`:** This file wraps the entire Expo Router application within a `Stack` navigator. By wrapping the `<Stack>` component with the `ErrorBoundary`, we ensure that any errors that bubble up to the root level are caught.
- **`ErrorBoundary` import:** Imports the ErrorBoundary component we created earlier.
- **`useEffect`:** This hook installs a global error handler using `global.ErrorUtils.setGlobalHandler`. This handler will catch errors that occur outside of the React component tree. The handler receives the error object (`e`) and a boolean indicating whether the error is fatal (`isFatal`). You can use this information to log the error, display an alert to the user, or navigate to a dedicated error page.

**Expo Error Boundary Library**

The `expo-error-boundary` library provides a more comprehensive solution for global error handling, including features like:

- Customizable fallback UI.
- Error reporting to services like Sentry or BugSnag.
- Automatic reloading of the application after an error.

Install the package using:

```plaintext
npx expo install expo-error-boundary
```

## Best Practices for Error Handling

- **Be Specific:** Catch specific types of errors whenever possible, rather than using a generic `catch` block. This allows you to handle different errors in different ways.
- **Log Errors:** Always log errors to a service like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics. This will help you identify and fix issues in your application.
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Provide informative and user-friendly error messages that guide users on how to resolve the issue. Avoid technical jargon or cryptic error codes.
- **Test Your Error Handling:** Thoroughly test your error handling logic to ensure that it works as expected in various scenarios.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Design your application to degrade gracefully in the event of errors. For example, if a particular feature is unavailable due to an error, provide an alternative solution or disable the feature gracefully.
- **Consider Using Try/Catch:** Wrap potentially failing code blocks in try/catch blocks, even if you have ErrorBoundaries.

## Conclusion

Handling unmatched routes (404 errors) and unexpected errors is essential for creating a robust and user-friendly Expo Router application. By implementing custom 404 pages and using React Error Boundaries, you can provide a better user experience, improve your app's stability, and simplify debugging. Remember to log errors and provide informative messages to guide your users.
By incorporating these strategies, you can build Expo Router applications that are both enjoyable to use and easy to maintain.
