# Django Form Wizards: A Comprehensive Guide to Django-Formtools

Creating complex forms with multiple steps and conditional logic can be a challenge in web development. Django-formtools provides a powerful and flexible solution for building wizard-style forms in your Django applications. This blog post will guide you through the process of using `django-formtools` to create a multi-step form, covering everything from installation to advanced usage scenarios.

## What is Django-Formtools?

Django-formtools is a collection of high-level tools for working with Django forms. It includes:

- **`FormWizard`:** A class for managing multi-step forms, also known as wizards.
- **`SessionWizardView`:** A wizard view that stores form data in the session.
- **`CookieWizardView`:** A wizard view that stores form data in cookies.

This guide will focus on the `SessionWizardView`, which is the most common and recommended approach.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Version 3.6 or later.
- **Django:** Version 3.0 or later.
- **django-formtools:** Install using `pip install django-formtools`.

## Installation

1.  **Install the package:**

    ```plaintext
    pip install django-formtools
    ```

2.  **Add `formtools` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:**

    ```plaintext
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'formtools',
        ...
    ]
    ```

## Creating a Multi-Step Form Wizard

Let's create a simple wizard that collects user information in two steps: personal details and contact information.

### 1. Define Your Forms

First, define your Django forms in `forms.py`:

```plaintext
# forms.py
from django import forms

class PersonalDetailsForm(forms.Form):
    first_name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, label="First Name")
    last_name = forms.CharField(max_length=100, label="Last Name")
    email = forms.EmailField(label="Email Address")

class ContactInfoForm(forms.Form):
    phone_number = forms.CharField(max_length=20, label="Phone Number")
    address = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea, label="Address")
```

### 2. Create the Wizard View

Now, create a view that extends `SessionWizardView` in `views.py`:

```plaintext
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from formtools.wizard.views import SessionWizardView
from .forms import PersonalDetailsForm, ContactInfoForm

FORMS = [("personal", PersonalDetailsForm), ("contact", ContactInfoForm)]
TEMPLATES = {
    "personal": "wizard/personal_details.html",
    "contact": "wizard/contact_info.html",
}


class UserInfoWizard(SessionWizardView):
    template_name = "wizard/wizard_form.html"  # General wizard template

    def get_template_names(self):
        return [TEMPLATES[self.steps.current]]

    def done(self, form_list, **kwargs):
        # Process the data from all forms
        form_data = [form.cleaned_data for form in form_list]
        # Combine data from all forms
        combined_data = {}
        for data in form_data:
            combined_data.update(data)

        # For demonstration purposes, let's just display the combined data.
        return HttpResponse(f"<h1>Form Data Submitted!</h1><pre>{combined_data}</pre>")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`FORMS`:** A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a step name (used for identifying the form) and the form class. The order defines the wizard steps.
- **`TEMPLATES`:** A dictionary mapping step names to template paths. This allows you to use different templates for each step.
- **`get_template_names()`:** This method returns the appropriate template based on the current step.
- **`done()`:** This method is called when the wizard is complete. It receives a list of all form instances. You can process and save the data here. We are simply displaying the combined data for demonstration purposes.

### 3. Create Templates

Create the necessary templates in your `templates` directory (e.g., `templates/wizard/`):

**`templates/wizard/wizard_form.html` (General Wizard Template):**

```plaintext
{# templates/wizard/wizard_form.html #}
<h1>Step {{ wizard.steps.step1 }} of {{ wizard.steps.count }}</h1>
<p>Step: {{ wizard.steps.step }}</p>

<form action="" method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  <table>
    {{ wizard.management_form }} {{ wizard.form.as_table }}
  </table>

  {% if wizard.steps.prev %}
  <button name="wizard_goto_step" type="submit" value="{{ wizard.steps.prev }}">Back</button>
  {% endif %}
  <button type="submit">Next</button>
</form>
```

**`templates/wizard/personal_details.html`:**

```plaintext
{# templates/wizard/personal_details.html #} {% extends "wizard/wizard_form.html" %} {% block
content %}
<h2>Personal Details</h2>
{{ block.super }} {% endblock %}
```

**`templates/wizard/contact_info.html`:**

```plaintext
{# templates/wizard/contact_info.html #} {% extends "wizard/wizard_form.html" %} {% block content %}
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
{{ block.super }} {% endblock %}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`wizard.management_form`:** This is a crucial part. It's a hidden form that `django-formtools` uses to manage the wizard's state (current step, step count, etc.). You **must** include it in your template.
- **`wizard.form.as_table`:** Renders the form for the current step as an HTML table. You can use `as_p`, `as_ul`, or render the fields individually for more control.
- **`wizard.steps.prev`:** The name of the previous step. Only display the "Back" button if there's a previous step.
- **`wizard.steps.step`:** The current step number (starting from 1).
- **`wizard.steps.step1`:** The step name, usually 'personal' or 'contact' from our `FORMS` definition.
- **`wizard.steps.count`:** The total number of steps in the wizard.

The individual templates for each step extend the general `wizard_form.html` to avoid repeating the wizard logic. They simply add a heading specific to that step.

### 4. Configure URLs

Add the wizard view to your `urls.py`:

```plaintext
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import UserInfoWizard

urlpatterns = [
    path('user-wizard/', UserInfoWizard.as_view(FORMS, template_name="wizard/wizard_form.html"), name='user_wizard'),
]
```

**Explanation:**

- `UserInfoWizard.as_view(FORMS, template_name="wizard/wizard_form.html")`: This is how you instantiate the `SessionWizardView`. You pass the `FORMS` definition (the list of form classes) and the initial `template_name`. The view automatically handles which form to display.

### 5. Accessing the Wizard

Now you can access your wizard by navigating to the URL you defined (e.g., `/user-wizard/`).

## Running the Example

1.  **Make migrations:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**

    ```plaintext
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3.  **Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/user-wizard/` (or your configured URL).**

You should see the first step of your wizard. Fill out the form and click "Next" to proceed to the next step. Once you've completed all steps, the `done()` method will be executed, and you'll see the combined data from all forms displayed.

## Advanced Usage

Here are some advanced techniques for working with `django-formtools`:

### 1. Conditional Form Display

You can conditionally skip or include certain steps based on user input. To do this, override the `get_form_list` or `condition_dict` attributes of the `SessionWizardView`.

**Example: Only show the "ContactInfoForm" if the user provides an email address.**

```plaintext
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from formtools.wizard.views import SessionWizardView
from .forms import PersonalDetailsForm, ContactInfoForm

FORMS = [("personal", PersonalDetailsForm), ("contact", ContactInfoForm)]
TEMPLATES = {
    "personal": "wizard/personal_details.html",
    "contact": "wizard/contact_info.html",
}


class UserInfoWizard(SessionWizardView):
    template_name = "wizard/wizard_form.html"  # General wizard template

    def get_template_names(self):
        return [TEMPLATES[self.steps.current]]

    def get_form_list(self):
        form_list = super().get_form_list()
        if 'personal-email' in self.request.session and self.request.session['personal-email']:
            return form_list
        else:
            return [('personal', PersonalDetailsForm)] # Only show personal details if no email in session

    def process_step(self, form):
        if self.steps.current == 'personal':
            # Save the email to the session so we can check it in get_form_list
            self.request.session['personal-email'] = form.cleaned_data.get('email')
        return self.get_form_step_data(form)

    def done(self, form_list, **kwargs):
        # Process the data from all forms
        form_data = [form.cleaned_data for form in form_list]
        # Combine data from all forms
        combined_data = {}
        for data in form_data:
            combined_data.update(data)

        # For demonstration purposes, let's just display the combined data.
        return HttpResponse(f"<h1>Form Data Submitted!</h1><pre>{combined_data}</pre>")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`get_form_list()`:** This method dynamically determines which forms should be included in the wizard. It checks if an email address exists in the session. If it doesn't, only the "PersonalDetailsForm" is included. We use a session variable here as form data from the first step has to persist across page requests.
- **`process_step`:** This method is called after a step is processed. Here we're saving the entered email to the session. This is how we make the data from the personal details form available in the following requests, to conditionally include or exclude forms.

### 2. Custom Form Processing

You might need to perform custom validation or data manipulation for a specific step. Override the `process_step()` method.

**Example: Convert the phone number to a standardized format before saving.**

```plaintext
# views.py (Inside the UserInfoWizard class)
def process_step(self, form):
    if self.steps.current == 'contact':
        phone_number = form.cleaned_data.get('phone_number')
        # Example: Remove all non-numeric characters
        cleaned_phone = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, phone_number))
        form.cleaned_data['phone_number'] = cleaned_phone

    return self.get_form_step_data(form)
```

### 3. Initial Data

You can pre-populate forms with initial data. Use the `get_form_initial` method.

**Example: Set the default address to "Unknown" for a new user.**

```plaintext
# views.py (Inside the UserInfoWizard class)
def get_form_initial(self, step):
    if step == 'contact':
        return {'address': 'Unknown'}
    return {}
```

### 4. Storing Data in Different Ways

The `SessionWizardView` stores data in the user's session. The `CookieWizardView` stores it in cookies (less common due to size limitations). You can also create your own wizard view that stores data in a database or other storage medium. This would involve overriding methods like `get_all_cleaned_data`, `get_step_data`, and `reset`.

### 5. Dynamic Forms

Sometimes you need to dynamically adjust the forms themselves. For example, the choices in a `ChoiceField` might depend on the data entered in a previous step. You can achieve this by overriding `get_form`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
# forms.py
class DynamicForm(forms.Form):
    choice_field = forms.ChoiceField(choices=[])  # Empty initially

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        dynamic_choices = kwargs.pop('dynamic_choices', [])  # Get choices from kwargs
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['choice_field'].choices = dynamic_choices


# views.py
class MyWizardView(SessionWizardView):
    def get_form_kwargs(self, step=None):
        kwargs = {}
        if step == 'step2':
            # Example: Get choices from the data in the first step
            first_step_data = self.get_cleaned_data_for_step('step1')
            if first_step_data:
                # Assuming first_step_data has a field named 'some_field'
                # that determines the choices
                if first_step_data['some_field'] == 'option1':
                    kwargs['dynamic_choices'] = [('a', 'A'), ('b', 'B')]
                else:
                    kwargs['dynamic_choices'] = [('c', 'C'), ('d', 'D')]
        return kwargs


    FORMS = [('step1', YourFirstForm), ('step2', DynamicForm)] # Your form setup
```

In this example:

- `DynamicForm` has a `choice_field` with empty choices initially.
- `get_form_kwargs` passes a `dynamic_choices` argument to the form's constructor. This argument is calculated based on data from the previous step (`step1`).
- The `__init__` method of `DynamicForm` updates the `choices` of the `choice_field`.

### 6. Using `form_list` with classes vs. instances

`django-formtools` typically expects a list of form _classes_ in the `FORMS` variable. It will then _instantiate_ those classes for you when rendering each step. If you have a reason to pass form _instances_ instead (e.g., you need to pre-configure them in a complex way), you can, but you need to be careful about how you handle it.

When using form instances:

- Make sure each form instance is _unique_. Do not reuse the same instance across different requests or steps. Each time the wizard is accessed, create a _new_ instance for each form.
- Be mindful of the form's `prefix`. `django-formtools` relies on the prefix to correctly identify and process forms in different steps. If you are manually instantiating forms, make sure the `prefix` is correctly managed by the wizard framework. This can be handled when setting up the formlist, e.g. `FORMS = [('step1', YourForm(prefix='step1'))]`

**Example using form instances, though typically you'll want form classes unless you have a compelling reason:**

```plaintext
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from formtools.wizard.views import SessionWizardView
from .forms import PersonalDetailsForm, ContactInfoForm

class UserInfoWizard(SessionWizardView):
    template_name = "wizard/wizard_form.html"

    FORMS = [('personal', PersonalDetailsForm()), ('contact', ContactInfoForm())] # Instances!

    def get_template_names(self):
        return {
          'personal': 'wizard/personal_details.html',
          'contact': 'wizard/contact_info.html',
        }.get(self.steps.current)


    def done(self, form_list, **kwargs):
        form_data = [form.cleaned_data for form in form_list]
        combined_data = {}
        for data in form_data:
            combined_data.update(data)
        return HttpResponse(f"<h1>Form Data Submitted!</h1><pre>{combined_data}</pre>")
```

**Important Considerations When Using Form Instances:**

- **Statefulness:** Be extremely careful if your form instances rely on any external state (e.g., database connections, cached data). This can lead to unexpected behavior when multiple users access the wizard concurrently. If this happens, each form should use it's own state.
- **Unintended Side Effects:** Modifications to a form instance (e.g., adding or removing fields) may affect other parts of your application if that instance is shared. The instance is shared across the form list.
- **Complexity:** Managing form instances manually can significantly increase the complexity of your code. Therefore, only use instances if there is a specific and justifiable reason for doing so.

In most cases, using form _classes_ and letting `django-formtools` handle instantiation is the cleaner and more maintainable approach.

## Conclusion

`django-formtools` provides a robust framework for building wizard-style forms in Django. By leveraging its features and understanding its underlying mechanisms, you can create complex, user-friendly forms that enhance the user experience of your web applications. Remember to thoroughly test your forms and handle potential edge cases to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience.
