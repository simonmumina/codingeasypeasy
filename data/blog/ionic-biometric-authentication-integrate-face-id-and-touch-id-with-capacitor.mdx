# Ionic Biometric Authentication: Integrate Face ID and Touch ID with Capacitor

Biometric authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, provides a secure and convenient way for users to authenticate in mobile applications. Integrating this feature into your Ionic app not only enhances security but also improves the user experience. This guide will walk you through how to implement biometric authentication in your Ionic application using Capacitor, allowing you to leverage native device capabilities with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Ionic CLI installed:** `npm install -g @ionic/cli`
- **Node.js and npm installed:** (version 16 or higher is recommended)
- **Capacitor CLI installed:** `npm install -g @capacitor/cli`
- **An existing Ionic project (or create a new one):** `ionic start myApp blank --type angular`
- **A mobile device or emulator with biometric authentication support (Face ID or Touch ID).** You'll need Xcode for iOS and Android Studio for Android.

## Step 1: Install the Capacitor Biometric Authentication Plugin

We'll be using the `@capacitor/biometrics` plugin, which provides a unified API for accessing biometric authentication on both iOS and Android.

```plaintext
npm install @capacitor/biometrics
npx cap sync
```

This command installs the plugin and then synchronizes your Capacitor configuration with your native projects. `npx cap sync` essentially updates your native iOS and Android projects based on the changes you've made in your Ionic/Capacitor project.

## Step 2: Update Native Platforms

After installing the plugin and running `npx cap sync`, you need to update the native projects to include the necessary permissions and configurations.

### iOS

1.  **Open Xcode:** `npx cap open ios`
2.  **Add the `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` permission:** In the `Info.plist` file, add a new key called `Privacy - Face ID Usage Description` and provide a descriptive message explaining why your app needs Face ID. For example: "This app uses Face ID to authenticate your identity securely."

    ```plaintext
    <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
    <string>This app uses Face ID to authenticate your identity securely.</string>
    ```

    **Important:** Without this permission, your app will crash when attempting to use Face ID. Apple requires a clear explanation of why you're requesting access to biometric data.

### Android

Android handles permissions dynamically. The plugin handles the runtime permission request if necessary (Android 6.0 and above). You might need to check the biometrics availability separately which we will cover later.

## Step 3: Implement the Biometric Authentication Logic in your Ionic App

Now, let's write the code to interact with the biometric authentication plugin in your Ionic app. We'll create a simple component that handles the authentication process.

```plaintext
// my-component.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'
import { Biometrics } from '@capacitor/biometrics'
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.scss'],
})
export class MyComponentComponent implements OnInit {
  biometricAvailable: boolean = false
  isAuthenticated: boolean = false
  errorMessage: string = ''

  constructor(private platform: Platform) {}

  async ngOnInit() {
    if (this.platform.is('cordova') || this.platform.is('capacitor')) {
      // Only run on a device
      await this.checkBiometricAvailability()
    } else {
      this.biometricAvailable = false
      this.errorMessage = 'Biometrics unavailable on this platform (web browser).'
    }
  }

  async checkBiometricAvailability() {
    try {
      const { available } = await Biometrics.isAvailable()
      this.biometricAvailable = available

      if (!available) {
        this.errorMessage = 'Biometric authentication is not available on this device.'
      }
    } catch (error: any) {
      this.biometricAvailable = false
      this.errorMessage = `Error checking biometric availability: ${error.message}`
      console.error('Error checking biometric availability:', error)
    }
  }

  async authenticate() {
    try {
      const { value } = await Biometrics.verify({
        reason: 'Please authenticate to access the app.', // The message shown to the user
        title: 'Authenticate', // (Android Only) The title of the dialog.  If omitted, will use your apps title.
        subtitle: 'Using biometric authentication', // (Android Only) The subtitle of the dialog.
        cancelTitle: 'Cancel', //(Android Only) The cancel button text.
      })

      this.isAuthenticated = value

      if (value) {
        console.log('Authentication successful!')
        // Navigate to secure content or perform other actions
      } else {
        console.log('Authentication failed.')
        this.errorMessage = 'Authentication failed. Please try again.'
      }
    } catch (error: any) {
      this.isAuthenticated = false
      this.errorMessage = `Authentication error: ${error.message}`
      console.error('Authentication error:', error)
    }
  }
}
```

```plaintext
<!-- my-component.component.html -->
<ion-content>
  <ion-card>
    <ion-card-header>
      <ion-card-title>Biometric Authentication</ion-card-title>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <div *ngIf="!biometricAvailable">
        <p>Biometric authentication is not available on this device.</p>
        <p *ngIf="errorMessage">{{ errorMessage }}</p>
      </div>

      <div *ngIf="biometricAvailable && !isAuthenticated">
        <ion-button expand="full" (click)="authenticate()">Authenticate with Biometrics</ion-button>
        <p *ngIf="errorMessage" class="error-message">{{ errorMessage }}</p>
      </div>

      <div *ngIf="isAuthenticated">
        <p>Authentication successful!</p>
        <!-- Display secure content here -->
      </div>
    </ion-card-content>
  </ion-card>
</ion-content>

<style>
  .error-message {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import necessary modules:** We import `Biometrics` from `@capacitor/biometrics` and `Platform` from `@ionic/angular`. `Platform` allows us to check if the app is running on a real device or in a web browser.
2.  **`checkBiometricAvailability()` function:** This function uses `Biometrics.isAvailable()` to determine if biometric authentication is supported and enabled on the device. The result (`available`) is then used to control the UI and display appropriate messages. Error handling is included to catch any potential issues during the availability check.
3.  **`authenticate()` function:** This function calls `Biometrics.verify()` to trigger the biometric authentication prompt. The `reason` property is crucial â€“ it's the message displayed to the user explaining why the app needs biometric authentication. It also passes in title, subtitle and cancelTitle which are only used for android. Error handling is included to display error messages to the user.
4.  **Template:** The template uses `*ngIf` directives to conditionally render UI elements based on the `biometricAvailable` and `isAuthenticated` flags. If biometric authentication is available, a button is displayed to trigger the authentication process. If authentication is successful, a message is displayed, and you can add your secure content here. Error messages are also displayed.

## Step 4: Build and Run Your App

Now, build and run your Ionic app on a real device or emulator with biometric authentication enabled.

```plaintext
ionic build
npx cap sync
npx cap open ios  # or npx cap open android
```

- `ionic build`: Compiles your Ionic app.
- `npx cap sync`: Updates the native project with any recent changes (like the plugin installation).
- `npx cap open ios` or `npx cap open android`: Opens the native IDE (Xcode or Android Studio) where you can build and run your app on a device or emulator.

## Best Practices

- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Always wrap the biometric authentication calls in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors. Display informative error messages to the user.
- **Provide Fallback Authentication:** If biometric authentication is not available or fails, offer a fallback authentication method, such as a password or PIN.
- **Secure Storage:** After successful authentication, securely store a token or flag to indicate that the user is authenticated. Consider using Capacitor's Preferences plugin or a secure storage solution to protect sensitive data.
- **Device Compatibility:** Test your implementation on different devices and operating systems to ensure compatibility and a consistent user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Consider users with disabilities. Provide alternative authentication methods for those who cannot use biometric authentication.
- **Security Considerations:** Never store sensitive data directly after biometric authentication. Use biometric authentication to gate access to secure storage or server-side authentication mechanisms. The `Biometrics.verify()` method only confirms that the user is who they claim to be based on the device's biometric data; it does not guarantee the security of subsequent operations.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Face ID is not available" or "Touch ID is not available"**:
  - Ensure that Face ID or Touch ID is enabled in the device settings.
  - Make sure your app has the necessary permissions (NSFaceIDUsageDescription in `Info.plist` for iOS).
  - Verify that the device has biometric authentication hardware.
- **App crashes when calling `Biometrics.verify()`**:
  - Double-check the `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` (iOS).
  - Ensure that the plugin is correctly installed and synchronized (run `npx cap sync`).
- **Authentication fails consistently:**
  - Check the device's biometric settings and ensure that Face ID or Touch ID is properly configured.
  - Restart the device.
- **Android Authentication Prompt Not Showing Up:** Make sure your device has configured a biometric credential.

## Conclusion

Integrating biometric authentication into your Ionic application with Capacitor is a straightforward process that significantly enhances security and user experience. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can seamlessly implement Face ID and Touch ID, providing a secure and convenient authentication method for your users. Remember to handle errors gracefully, provide fallback authentication options, and prioritize security best practices.
