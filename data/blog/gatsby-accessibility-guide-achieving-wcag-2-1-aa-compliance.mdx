# Gatsby Accessibility Guide: Achieving WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

Creating accessible websites is not just a nice-to-have; it's an ethical imperative and, in many cases, a legal requirement. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA are the gold standard for web accessibility, ensuring that your content is usable by people with disabilities. This guide will provide a detailed walkthrough of how to implement full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in your Gatsby project.

## Why is Accessibility Important?

- **Inclusivity:** Ensures everyone, regardless of disability, can access and use your website.
- **SEO Benefits:** Search engines favor accessible sites, improving your ranking.
- **Wider Audience:** Accessibility benefits users with temporary disabilities (e.g., broken arm), those using mobile devices in bright sunlight, and older adults.
- **Legal Compliance:** Many countries have laws requiring web accessibility.

## Understanding WCAG 2.1 AA

WCAG 2.1 AA consists of four principles (POUR):

- **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **Understandable:** Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
- **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

Each principle has guidelines, and each guideline has testable success criteria. We will focus on the AA level success criteria throughout this guide.

## Setting Up Your Gatsby Project for Accessibility

Before diving into code, let's set up our Gatsby project with the necessary tools:

1.  **Gatsby CLI:** Ensure you have the Gatsby CLI installed:

    ```plaintext
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **New Project (or Existing Project):** Create a new project, or navigate to your existing project:

    ```plaintext
    gatsby new my-accessible-gatsby-site
    cd my-accessible-gatsby-site
    ```

3.  **ESLint and Prettier:** (Recommended) Use ESLint with an accessibility plugin and Prettier to maintain code consistency and catch potential accessibility issues early.

    ```plaintext
    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-config-prettier
    ```

    Create `.eslintrc.js` in your project root:

    ```plaintext
    module.exports = {
      extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended', 'prettier'],
      plugins: ['jsx-a11y'],
      rules: {
        'jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid': 'off', // Allow Gatsby links
        'jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control': 'off', // Handle cases where labels may not be directly associated for styling
      },
      settings: {
        react: {
          version: 'detect',
        },
      },
      env: {
        browser: true,
        node: true,
        es6: true,
      },
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 2020,
        sourceType: 'module',
        ecmaFeatures: {
          jsx: true,
        },
      },
    }
    ```

    Create `.prettierrc.js` in your project root:

    ```plaintext
    module.exports = {
      semi: true,
      trailingComma: 'all',
      singleQuote: true,
      printWidth: 120,
      tabWidth: 2,
    }
    ```

    Add lint and format scripts to your `package.json`:

    ```plaintext
    "scripts": {
      "lint": "eslint .",
      "format": "prettier --write ."
    }
    ```

## Implementing WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criteria in Gatsby

Now, let's delve into specific WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria and how to address them in your Gatsby code.

### 1. Perceivable

- **1.1.1 Non-text Content:** Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.

  - **Images:** Use the `alt` attribute to describe the image's content and function. If the image is purely decorative, use an empty `alt=""` attribute.

    ```plaintext
    <img src="/images/my-image.jpg" alt="A smiling person using a laptop" />

    // Decorative image
    <img src="/images/decorative-border.png" alt="" aria-hidden="true" />
    ```

    - `aria-hidden="true"`: This attribute hides the element from assistive technologies like screen readers, ensuring that decorative images are ignored.

  - **Videos and Audio:** Provide captions, transcripts, or audio descriptions for all multimedia content.

    - **Captions:** Provide synchronized captions for all videos. HTML5 `<track>` element is the standard way to include captions.
    - **Transcripts:** Offer a text transcript of the audio or video content.
    - **Audio Descriptions:** Provide audio descriptions of visual information that is not conveyed through the audio track.

    ```plaintext
    <video controls>
      <source src="/videos/my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      <track src="/captions/my-video.vtt" kind="captions" label="English captions" srclang="en" default />
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    <p>Transcript: <a href="/transcripts/my-video.txt">Download Transcript</a></p>
    ```

- **1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded):** Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):** The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

  - **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background colors. Use a color contrast checker like [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or a similar tool integrated into your design or development workflow.

    ```plaintext
    /* Example with sufficient contrast (4.5:1 or higher) */
    .text-with-good-contrast {
      color: #000000; /* Black */
      background-color: #ffffff; /* White */
    }

    /* Example with insufficient contrast */
    .text-with-bad-contrast {
      color: #a9a9a9; /* Dark Gray */
      background-color: #ffffff; /* White */
    }
    ```

  - **Large Text (18pt or 14pt bold):** Requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

- **1.4.1 Use of Color:** Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

  - **Don't rely solely on color:** If you're using color to convey information, provide an alternative means, such as text or an icon.

    ```plaintext
    // Bad: Only using color to indicate a required field
    <input type="text" style={{ borderColor: 'red' }} />

    // Good: Using color and an asterisk to indicate a required field
    <label htmlFor="name">Name <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>*</span></label>
    <input type="text" id="name" />
    ```

### 2. Operable

- **2.1.1 Keyboard:** All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.

  - **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure users can navigate and interact with all elements using the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Arrow keys, Spacebar). Pay special attention to custom components and interactive elements.

    - **Focus Indicators:** Use CSS to style the `:focus` state of interactive elements, making it clear which element currently has focus. Avoid removing focus outlines unless you provide a visually distinct alternative.

      ```plaintext
      a:focus,
      button:focus,
      input:focus {
        outline: 2px solid blue; /* A clear focus outline */
      }
      ```

    - **Focus Management:** In single-page applications (SPAs) like Gatsby sites, manage focus carefully. When a new page or modal opens, move focus to a logical starting point within the new content (e.g., the heading of the page or the first interactive element in a modal). Use `element.focus()` to programmatically set focus.

      ```plaintext
      import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

      const MyComponent = () => {
        const headingRef = useRef(null)

        useEffect(() => {
          if (headingRef.current) {
            headingRef.current.focus()
          }
        }, [])

        return (
          <div>
            <h1 tabIndex="-1" ref={headingRef}>
              My Component
            </h1>
            <p>Content...</p>
          </div>
        )
      }

      export default MyComponent
      ```

      - `tabIndex="-1"` makes the heading focusable via JavaScript but not part of the natural tab order.

    - **Skip Navigation Link:** Provide a "Skip to Content" link at the top of each page that allows users to bypass the main navigation and jump directly to the page content. This is especially helpful for users who navigate with screen readers or keyboard only.

      ```plaintext
      import { Link } from 'gatsby'
      import { SkipNavLink, SkipNavContent } from '@reach/skip-nav'
      import '@reach/skip-nav/styles.css'

      const Layout = ({ children }) => (
        <>
          <SkipNavLink />
          <header>
            {/* Navigation */}
            <nav>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
              <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
            </nav>
          </header>
          <SkipNavContent>
            <main>{children}</main>
          </SkipNavContent>
          <footer>{/* Footer */}</footer>
        </>
      )

      export default Layout
      ```

      Install `@reach/skip-nav`:

      ```plaintext
      npm install @reach/skip-nav
      ```

- **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context):** The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone, or from the link text together with its programmatically determined context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.

  - **Descriptive Link Text:** Use clear and descriptive link text that accurately reflects the destination of the link. Avoid generic phrases like "click here" or "read more."

    ```plaintext
    // Bad:
    <a href="/article">Click here to read more.</a>

    // Good:
    <a href="/article">Read our article about Gatsby accessibility.</a>
    ```

    - If the link text alone isn't sufficient, provide additional context in the surrounding text.

- **2.4.7 Focus Visible:** Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.

### 3. Understandable

- **3.1.1 Language of Page:** The default human language of each web page can be programmatically determined.

  - **`<html>` `lang` Attribute:** Specify the language of your page using the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element.

    ```plaintext
    import React from 'react'
    import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet'

    const Layout = ({ children }) => (
      <>
        <Helmet htmlAttributes={{ lang: 'en' }}>
          <title>My Accessible Gatsby Site</title>
        </Helmet>
        {children}
      </>
    )

    export default Layout
    ```

    Install react-helmet

    ```plaintext
    npm install react-helmet
    ```

- **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions:** Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.

  - **Clear Labels:** Use clear and concise labels for all form fields. Associate labels with their corresponding input elements using the `for` attribute (matching the input's `id`).

    ```plaintext
    <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
    ```

  - **Error Messages:** Provide clear and helpful error messages when users make mistakes in forms. Indicate which fields have errors and explain how to correct them.

    ```plaintext
    const [name, setName] = React.useState('')
    const [nameError, setNameError] = React.useState('')

    const handleSubmit = (event) => {
      event.preventDefault()
      if (!name) {
        setNameError('Name is required.')
      } else {
        setNameError('')
        // Submit form
      }
    }

    return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          name="name"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
        {nameError && <p className="error-message">{nameError}</p>}
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
    ```

### 4. Robust

- **4.1.1 Parsing:** In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.

  - **Valid HTML:** Write valid HTML code that follows the specifications. Use a validator like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check your code for errors.

- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value:** For all user interface components (including but not limited to form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

  - **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance the accessibility of custom interactive components. ARIA provides semantic information to assistive technologies about the role, state, and properties of elements.

    - **Roles:** Define the role of an element (e.g., `role="button"`, `role="navigation"`).
    - **States:** Indicate the current state of an element (e.g., `aria-expanded="true"`, `aria-checked="true"`).
    - **Properties:** Provide additional information about an element (e.g., `aria-label="Close"`).

    ```plaintext
    <button role="button" aria-label="Close" onClick={handleClose}>
      <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
    </button>
    ```

    - `aria-hidden="true"` on the `<span>` ensures the multiplication sign isn't read redundantly by the screen reader since the button has a descriptive label.

    **Important Considerations for ARIA:**

    - **Use ARIA judiciously:** Only use ARIA when native HTML elements don't provide the necessary semantic information.
    - **Don't contradict native semantics:** Don't use ARIA to override the inherent semantics of an HTML element.
    - **Ensure keyboard accessibility:** If you use ARIA to create custom interactive elements, ensure they are fully keyboard accessible.
    - **Test with assistive technologies:** Always test your ARIA implementation with screen readers and other assistive technologies to ensure it works as expected.

## Gatsby Specific Accessibility Considerations

- **Gatsby Image:** Use `gatsby-plugin-image` for optimal image loading and accessibility. Remember to set the `alt` attribute correctly.

```plaintext
import { GatsbyImage, getImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image'

const MyComponent = ({ data }) => {
  const image = getImage(data.file)
  return <GatsbyImage image={image} alt="Description of the image" />
}
```

- **Gatsby Link:** Gatsby's `<Link>` component handles internal navigation. Ensure that link text is descriptive.

## Testing Your Gatsby Website for Accessibility

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure your Gatsby website is accessible.

1.  **Automated Testing Tools:**

    - **Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools):** Lighthouse is a built-in Chrome DevTools audit that provides accessibility scores and suggestions.
    - **axe DevTools (Browser Extension):** axe DevTools is a powerful accessibility testing tool that identifies accessibility issues in your code. Available as a browser extension.
    - **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool):** WAVE is a browser extension that provides visual feedback on accessibility issues on a webpage.
    - **gatsby-plugin-accessibilityjs:** This plugin uses AccessibilityJS to automatically test your Gatsby site for common accessibility issues during development. Install with `npm install gatsby-plugin-accessibilityjs` and add to your `gatsby-config.js`.

2.  **Manual Testing:**

    - **Keyboard Navigation:** Test all functionality using only the keyboard.
    - **Screen Reader Testing:** Use a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to experience your website as a visually impaired user would.
    - **Color Contrast Testing:** Use a color contrast checker to verify sufficient contrast.
    - **Zoom Testing:** Zoom the page to 200% to ensure content remains readable and usable.

3.  **User Testing:**

    - Involve users with disabilities in the testing process to get valuable feedback on the accessibility of your website.

## Gatsby Plugins for Accessibility

Consider using these Gatsby plugins to further enhance accessibility:

- **gatsby-plugin-react-helmet:** For managing document head metadata, including setting the `lang` attribute.
- **gatsby-plugin-manifest:** Creates a manifest file for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), improving user experience. Make sure the `name`, `short_name`, and `description` fields in your manifest are descriptive and accessible.
- **gatsby-plugin-offline:** Provides offline support for your website, improving resilience.

## Conclusion

Implementing WCAG 2.1 AA compliance in your Gatsby project requires a comprehensive approach, encompassing semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast, and thorough testing. By following the guidelines and techniques outlined in this guide, you can create a more inclusive and accessible web experience for all users. Remember that accessibility is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and improvement are essential. Make accessibility a core part of your development workflow and create websites that are truly usable by everyone.
