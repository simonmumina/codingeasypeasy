# How to List All User Accounts in Windows Using CMD (net user Command)

Understanding and managing user accounts is a crucial aspect of Windows administration. Whether you're troubleshooting access issues, performing security audits, or simply need an overview of the users on your system, the Command Prompt (CMD) offers a powerful and readily available tool: the `net user` command. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to use `net user` to list all user accounts in Windows, along with explanations and practical examples to enhance your understanding.

## Why Use CMD to List User Accounts?

While the graphical user interface (GUI) provides ways to manage user accounts, using the command line offers several advantages:

- **Speed and Efficiency:** For experienced users, the command line can be significantly faster than navigating through multiple GUI windows.
- **Scripting and Automation:** CMD allows you to incorporate user account management into scripts for automation, saving time and effort on repetitive tasks.
- **Remote Administration:** You can remotely manage user accounts on other computers using CMD with the appropriate permissions.
- **Troubleshooting:** In scenarios where the GUI is unavailable or malfunctioning, CMD provides a reliable alternative for user management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Administrator Privileges:** You need administrator privileges on the Windows system to execute the `net user` command and manage user accounts effectively.
- **Access to CMD:** You need to be able to open the Command Prompt.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Listing User Accounts with `net user`

Here's how to list all user accounts using the `net user` command:

**1. Open the Command Prompt (CMD) as Administrator:**

- Press the Windows key.
- Type "cmd" or "command prompt".
- Right-click on "Command Prompt" in the search results.
- Select "Run as administrator".

**2. Execute the `net user` Command:**

In the elevated Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:

```plaintext
net user
```

**3. Interpret the Output:**

The `net user` command will output a list of user accounts defined on your system. The output will be formatted as follows:

```
User accounts for \\YOUR_COMPUTER_NAME

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            DefaultAccount           Guest
WDAGUtilityAccount       YOUR_USERNAME
The command completed successfully.
```

- **YOUR_COMPUTER_NAME:** This represents the name of your computer or the domain you are connected to.
- **User Accounts:** The lines below the header list the usernames of all accounts on the system. Common default accounts like `Administrator`, `Guest`, `DefaultAccount`, and `WDAGUtilityAccount` will likely be present. `YOUR_USERNAME` will be your primary user account.

**Example:**

If your computer name is "MyPC", the output might look like this:

```
User accounts for \\MyPC

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            Guest                  MyUser
DefaultAccount           WDAGUtilityAccount
The command completed successfully.
```

This indicates that "Administrator", "Guest", "MyUser", "DefaultAccount", and "WDAGUtilityAccount" are all user accounts on the "MyPC" system.

## Understanding the Output

The `net user` command provides a basic list of usernames. To get more detailed information about a specific user account, you can use the following command:

```plaintext
net user <username>
```

Replace `<username>` with the actual username you want to examine. For example, to view details for the "Administrator" account, you would use:

```plaintext
net user Administrator
```

The output will include information such as:

- **User name:** The actual username.
- **Full Name:** The user's full name (if set).
- **Comment:** A description of the user account (if any).
- **User's comment:** Another description field.
- **Country code:** The country code associated with the user's language settings.
- **Account active:** Whether the account is enabled or disabled.
- **Account expires:** The date the account will expire (if configured).
- **Password last set:** The date the password was last changed.
- **Password expires:** The date the password will expire (if configured).
- **Password changeable:** Whether the user can change their password.
- **Password required:** Whether a password is required for the account.
- **User may change password:** Whether the user is allowed to change their password.
- **Workstations allowed:** The workstations from which the user can log in (if restricted).
- **Logon script:** The logon script executed when the user logs in.
- **User profile path:** The path to the user's profile folder.
- **Home directory:** The user's home directory.
- **Last logon:** The date and time of the user's last logon.
- **Logon hours allowed:** The hours during which the user is allowed to log in.
- **Local Group Memberships:** The local groups the user is a member of.
- **Global Group memberships:** The global groups the user is a member of.

## Advanced Usage and Examples

Here are some more advanced ways to use the `net user` command:

**1. Redirecting Output to a File:**

You can redirect the output of `net user` to a text file for later analysis or documentation. Use the `>` operator to redirect the output:

```plaintext
net user > user_list.txt
```

This command will create a file named `user_list.txt` in the current directory and save the list of user accounts to it.

To append the output to an existing file, use the `>>` operator:

```plaintext
net user >> user_list.txt
```

**2. Listing Users and their Details to a File:**

You can loop through all users and get their details, saving it into a file using a batch script:

```plaintext
@echo off
echo User Account Details: > user_details.txt
for /f "tokens=*" %%a in ('net user') do (
  echo -------- >> user_details.txt
  echo User: %%a >> user_details.txt
  net user "%%a" >> user_details.txt
)
echo Complete! Check user_details.txt
pause
```

Save this as a `.bat` file (e.g., `get_user_details.bat`) and run it as administrator. It will create a file named `user_details.txt` containing details of all user accounts. Note that this approach might include error messages in the file if `net user` fails for any specific account. Robust error handling would require a more complex script. Also, the names in the first `net user` command will not be enclosed in quotes while being executed. This means that `net user` command will fail for certain default system users as they include whitespaces and special characters.

**3. Filtering User Accounts (Requires More Advanced Scripting):**

While `net user` itself doesn't offer built-in filtering, you can use other CMD commands like `findstr` in combination with `net user` within a batch script to filter the results. This is beyond the scope of a basic tutorial, but it's a possible avenue for more customized user account listings. You can, for example, filter for accounts with "Administrator" in their name. However, this is not an exact match and will require careful consideration of your search criteria.

## Security Considerations

- **Protect Administrator Accounts:** Ensure the built-in "Administrator" account has a strong and unique password. Consider disabling it and creating a different administrator account with a different name.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid giving standard users administrator privileges unless absolutely required.
- **Regular Audits:** Regularly review user accounts and their privileges to identify and remove unnecessary or inactive accounts.
- **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies to ensure users choose strong and complex passwords.
- **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Monitor user account activity for suspicious behavior, such as unusual logon times or attempts to access sensitive resources.

## Conclusion

The `net user` command is a valuable tool for listing and managing user accounts in Windows through the command prompt. This guide has covered the basic usage, advanced techniques, and security considerations for effectively using `net user` for your Windows administration tasks. By mastering this command, you can gain greater control over your system's user accounts and enhance its overall security. Remember to always run CMD as an administrator to have the necessary permissions.
