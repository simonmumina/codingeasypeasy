# Monorepo Mastery: Setting up pnpm Workspaces with Nuxt for Scalable Web Apps

As your web application grows in complexity, managing multiple repositories for different parts of your project can become a maintenance nightmare. This is where the monorepo architecture shines. A monorepo (single repository) centralizes all your code into one place, fostering code reuse, simplifying dependency management, and streamlining development workflows.

This guide walks you through setting up a robust monorepo using **pnpm workspaces** and **Nuxt.js**, a powerful framework for building universal Vue.js applications. We'll cover everything from initial project setup to configuring shared components and utilities.

## Why Monorepo with pnpm and Nuxt?

- **Code Sharing:** Easily share components, utilities, and even entire modules between different applications within your monorepo.
- **Dependency Management:** pnpm's efficient dependency management ensures that dependencies are shared across workspaces, saving disk space and improving installation speed. Its hard linking mechanism also prevents dependency conflicts.
- **Simplified Refactoring:** Refactoring code across multiple projects becomes much easier within a single repository.
- **Atomic Changes:** Make changes that span multiple projects in a single commit, ensuring consistency.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** Streamlined development workflows and a single source of truth can significantly improve developer productivity.
- **Nuxt.js Benefits:** Leverage the power of Nuxt.js for server-side rendering, static site generation, and a great developer experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 16 or higher is recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **pnpm:** Install pnpm globally using npm: `npm install -g pnpm`

## Step 1: Initialize the Monorepo

1.  **Create a Root Directory:** Start by creating a new directory for your monorepo.

    ```plaintext
    mkdir my-nuxt-monorepo
    cd my-nuxt-monorepo
    ```

2.  **Initialize pnpm:** Create a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file in the root directory. This file tells pnpm which directories are part of the monorepo.

    ```plaintext
    touch pnpm-workspace.yaml
    ```

3.  **Configure `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:** Add the following content to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

    ```plaintext
    packages:
      - 'apps/*'
      - 'packages/*'
    ```

    This configuration tells pnpm to treat any directory under `apps/` and `packages/` as a workspace.

4.  **Initialize `package.json`:** Initialize a `package.json` file in the root directory. This file will manage shared dependencies and scripts for the entire monorepo.

    ```plaintext
    pnpm init
    ```

    or

    ```plaintext
    npm init -y
    ```

    (if you're still preferring npm for initial setup, but make sure to switch to `pnpm install` later on)

5.  **Install Dependencies**: To ensure reproducibility of the monorepo, it's recommended to use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`

## Step 2: Create the Nuxt.js App

1.  **Create the `apps` Directory:** Create a directory named `apps` to house your Nuxt.js application.

    ```plaintext
    mkdir apps
    cd apps
    ```

2.  **Generate a Nuxt.js Project:** Use the `npx nuxi init` command within the `apps` directory to create a new Nuxt.js project. Let's call our app `my-app`.

    ```plaintext
    npx nuxi init my-app-frontend
    # Choose your options, typically:
    # -  'empty' for 'Project Template'
    # -  'Use latest version' for 'Use latest version'
    # etc.
    ```

3.  **Move Nuxt Project:** This will generate a new folder inside `apps` named `my-app-frontend`.

    ```plaintext
    mv my-app-frontend ..
    cd ..
    rm -rf apps # removing the temporary 'apps' folder
    ```

    Rename the folder to `apps/my-app` as specified in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file.

    ```plaintext
    mv my-app-frontend apps/my-app
    ```

4.  **Install Nuxt Dependencies:** Go back to the root of the monorepo and install the dependencies for the Nuxt.js application. pnpm will automatically link the dependencies within the monorepo.

    ```plaintext
    cd .. # Back to the root directory
    pnpm install
    ```

## Step 3: Create Shared Packages

1.  **Create the `packages` Directory:** Create a directory named `packages` to store your shared code.

    ```plaintext
    mkdir packages
    cd packages
    ```

2.  **Create a Shared Component Package:** Let's create a package for a reusable button component. Create a directory named `ui-library` inside the `packages` directory.

    ```plaintext
    mkdir ui-library
    cd ui-library
    ```

3.  **Initialize the `ui-library` Package:** Create a `package.json` file for the `ui-library` package.

    ```plaintext
    pnpm init
    ```

4.  **Configure `ui-library/package.json`:** Modify the `ui-library/package.json` file. Important settings include:

    - `name`: Set a unique name for your package, e.g., `@my-monorepo/ui-library`. Use a scoped name to avoid naming conflicts.
    - `version`: Start with `0.0.0` or `0.1.0`.
    - `main`: Specify the entry point for your component library, e.g., `dist/index.js`.
    - `module`: Specify the entry point for ES modules, e.g., `dist/index.mjs`.
    - `types`: Specify the path to your TypeScript definition file, e.g., `dist/index.d.ts`.
    - `exports`: Define how your package can be imported in different environments. This ensures compatibility with different module systems.
    - `scripts`: Add a `build` script to compile your component library using a build tool like `esbuild`, `rollup` or `vite`.

    Here's an example `ui-library/package.json`:

    ```plaintext
    {
      "name": "@my-monorepo/ui-library",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "description": "A shared UI library for the monorepo.",
      "main": "dist/index.js",
      "module": "dist/index.mjs",
      "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
      "exports": {
        ".": {
          "require": "./dist/index.js",
          "import": "./dist/index.mjs",
          "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
        }
      },
      "scripts": {
        "build": "esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --format=esm,cjs --outdir=dist --sourcemap --dts"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "devDependencies": {
        "esbuild": "^0.19.0"
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Create the Button Component:** Create a `src` directory inside the `ui-library` package and add a `Button.vue` component file.

    ```plaintext
    mkdir src
    touch src/Button.vue
    ```

    Here's a simple `src/Button.vue` component:

    ```plaintext
    <template>
      <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
        <slot />
      </button>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    // You can add props and logic here
    </script>

    <style scoped>
    /* Add styling here if needed, or import from a separate CSS file */
    </style>
    ```

6.  **Create the Entry Point:** Create an `index.ts` file inside the `src` directory. This file will export all the components from the library.

    ```plaintext
    touch src/index.ts
    ```

    Here's the `src/index.ts` file:

    ```plaintext
    import Button from './Button.vue'

    export { Button }
    ```

7.  **Install Dev Dependencies (esbuild):**
    To build the package, you need to install a build tool such as `esbuild`:

    ```plaintext
    pnpm add -D esbuild vue
    ```

    Note that `vue` is added as a dev dependency since the component needs it for local build process, but it will be referenced by Nuxt application and will not be included in the final package.

8.  **Build the Package:** Run the `build` script from the root of your monorepo. This will compile the component library and generate the output files in the `dist` directory.

    ```plaintext
    cd ../.. # back to the monorepo root
    pnpm build
    ```

    This command runs the `build` script defined in the `ui-library/package.json` file using pnpm. You should now have a `dist` directory inside the `ui-library` package containing the compiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files.

## Step 4: Use the Shared Component in the Nuxt App

1.  **Import the Component:** Open the `pages/index.vue` file in your Nuxt.js application (`apps/my-app/pages/index.vue`) and import the `Button` component from the `@my-monorepo/ui-library` package.

    ```plaintext
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to My Nuxt App!</h1>
        <Button>Click Me!</Button>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    import { Button } from '@my-monorepo/ui-library';
    </script>
    ```

2.  **Configure Nuxt to Transpile the Package**

    Add `@my-monorepo/ui-library` to the `build.transpile` array in `nuxt.config.ts`. This tells Nuxt to transpile the shared package during the build process, ensuring compatibility with the Nuxt application.

    ```plaintext
    // nuxt.config.ts
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      build: {
        transpile: ['@my-monorepo/ui-library'],
      },
    })
    ```

3.  **Run the Nuxt App:** Start your Nuxt.js development server.

    ```plaintext
    cd apps/my-app
    pnpm dev
    ```

    You should now see your Nuxt.js application running with the shared `Button` component rendered on the page! If you see an error about not finding `@my-monorepo/ui-library`, ensure you've run `pnpm install` in the root of the monorepo.

## Step 5: Create Shared Utils

Let's create a shared utility package named `utils` to house common functions.

1.  **Create the `utils` Directory:** Inside the `packages` directory, create a new directory called `utils`.

    ```plaintext
    cd packages
    mkdir utils
    cd utils
    ```

2.  **Initialize the `utils` Package:** Create a `package.json` file for the `utils` package.

    ```plaintext
    pnpm init
    ```

3.  **Configure `utils/package.json`:** Modify the `utils/package.json` file, similar to the `ui-library` package. Example:

    ```plaintext
    {
      "name": "@my-monorepo/utils",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "description": "Shared utility functions.",
      "main": "dist/index.js",
      "module": "dist/index.mjs",
      "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
      "exports": {
        ".": {
          "require": "./dist/index.js",
          "import": "./dist/index.mjs",
          "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
        }
      },
      "scripts": {
        "build": "esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --format=esm,cjs --outdir=dist --sourcemap --dts"
      },
      "keywords": [],
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "devDependencies": {
        "esbuild": "^0.19.0"
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Create a Utility Function:** Create a `src` directory and a `format-date.ts` file inside it.

    ```plaintext
    mkdir src
    touch src/format-date.ts
    ```

    Here's an example `src/format-date.ts` function:

    ```plaintext
    export function formatDate(date: Date): string {
      return new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {
        year: 'numeric',
        month: 'long',
        day: 'numeric',
      }).format(date)
    }
    ```

5.  **Create the Entry Point:** Create an `index.ts` file inside the `src` directory.

    ```plaintext
    touch src/index.ts
    ```

    Here's the `src/index.ts` file:

    ```plaintext
    export * from './format-date'
    ```

6.  **Build the Package:** Run the `build` script from the root of your monorepo.

    ```plaintext
    cd ../.. # back to the monorepo root
    pnpm add -D esbuild
    pnpm build
    ```

7.  **Use the Utility Function in Nuxt:** Import and use the `formatDate` function in your Nuxt app. Example:

    ```plaintext
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Today is: {{ formattedDate }}</h1>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script setup>
    import { formatDate } from '@my-monorepo/utils';

    const today = new Date();
    const formattedDate = formatDate(today);
    </script>
    ```

8.  **Configure Nuxt to Transpile the Package**

    Add `@my-monorepo/utils` to the `build.transpile` array in `nuxt.config.ts`. This tells Nuxt to transpile the shared package during the build process.

```plaintext
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  build: {
    transpile: ['@my-monorepo/ui-library', '@my-monorepo/utils'],
  },
})
```

## Advanced Considerations

- **TypeScript:** Using TypeScript enhances type safety and improves code maintainability, especially in a monorepo. Configure TypeScript in each package and in the root.
- **Linting and Formatting:** Set up linting (e.g., ESLint) and formatting (e.g., Prettier) at the root level with shared configurations to ensure consistent code style across all projects.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for your shared components and utilities. Consider using a testing framework like Jest or Vitest. You can set up shared test configurations at the root level.
- **Versioning and Publishing:** Use tools like `changesets` to manage versioning and publishing of your shared packages. This ensures that changes are properly tracked and released.
- **CI/CD:** Integrate your monorepo with a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment. Tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI can be used.
- **Storybook:** Use Storybook to develop and showcase your shared UI components in isolation. This allows for easier testing and documentation.
- **Nx:** Consider using [Nx](https://nx.dev/) as a Monorepo Management Framework to provide code generation, build caching and more.
