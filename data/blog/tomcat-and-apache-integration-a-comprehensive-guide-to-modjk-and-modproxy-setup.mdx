# Tomcat and Apache Integration: A Comprehensive Guide to Mod_jk and Mod_proxy Setup

Integrating Apache HTTP Server with Apache Tomcat is a common practice for improving the performance, security, and scalability of Java web applications. Apache HTTP Server excels at serving static content and handling SSL, while Tomcat is a robust servlet container for dynamic Java applications. This guide provides detailed instructions on setting up this integration using two popular methods: `mod_jk` and `mod_proxy`.

## Why Integrate Apache HTTP Server and Tomcat?

Before diving into the configuration, let's understand the benefits of this integration:

*   **Static Content Handling:** Apache is highly efficient at serving static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).  Offloading this task from Tomcat frees up Tomcat resources for handling dynamic requests.
*   **SSL Termination:** Apache can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, simplifying certificate management and improving security.  Tomcat then only deals with unencrypted requests on the backend.
*   **Load Balancing:**  You can use Apache as a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple Tomcat instances, improving performance and availability.
*   **Security:** Apache provides a robust security layer, allowing you to implement access controls, request filtering, and other security measures.
*   **Flexibility:** You gain more flexibility in managing your web application infrastructure. You can upgrade or restart Tomcat without impacting static content delivery.

## Choosing Between mod_jk and mod_proxy

Both `mod_jk` and `mod_proxy` can be used to integrate Apache and Tomcat, but they have different characteristics:

*   **mod_jk:**  A mature and well-established module specifically designed for Tomcat integration. It uses the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) for communication between Apache and Tomcat.

    *   **Pros:**  Optimized for Tomcat, good performance in many scenarios, widely documented.
    *   **Cons:**  AJP protocol can be less flexible than HTTP, requires specific configuration for AJP.

*   **mod_proxy:** A more general-purpose proxy module that can be used with various backend servers, including Tomcat. It communicates via HTTP(S).

    *   **Pros:** More flexible, can be used with other backends besides Tomcat, uses standard HTTP(S) protocol.
    *   **Cons:** Can be slightly less performant than `mod_jk` in some scenarios, requires correct HTTP header handling.

Generally, `mod_proxy` is becoming the more recommended approach due to its flexibility and the prevalence of HTTP/HTTPS communication. However, `mod_jk` remains a viable option, especially in existing deployments.

## Setting up Apache and Tomcat

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed and running:

*   **Apache HTTP Server:** Version 2.4 or later.
*   **Apache Tomcat:** Version 8 or later.
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required for Tomcat.

**Important:**  Throughout this guide, replace placeholder values like `yourdomain.com`, `8080`, `8009` with your actual domain and port numbers.  Also, file paths may vary depending on your operating system and installation locations.

## Method 1: Using mod_jk

### 1. Install `mod_jk`

The installation process depends on your operating system:

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-jk
    ```

*   **CentOS/RHEL:**

    ```bash
    sudo yum install mod_jk
    ```

*   **Windows:**

    *   Download the appropriate `mod_jk.so` file from the Apache Tomcat website (e.g., from the [Tomcat Connectors](https://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/) page). Choose the correct version for your Apache installation (32-bit or 64-bit).
    *   Place the `mod_jk.so` file in your Apache modules directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\modules`).

### 2. Configure `workers.properties`

Create a `workers.properties` file that defines the Tomcat worker(s). This file tells `mod_jk` how to connect to your Tomcat instances.  A common location is `/etc/apache2/workers.properties` or `/usr/local/apache2/conf/workers.properties`.

```properties
# Define 1 real worker using ajp13
worker.list=worker1

# Set properties for worker1 (adjust values to match your setup)
worker.worker1.type=ajp13
worker.worker1.host=localhost
worker.worker1.port=8009
worker.worker1.lbfactor=1
worker.worker1.cachesize=10
worker.worker1.cache_timeout=600
worker.worker1.socket_keepalive=True
worker.worker1.connection_pool_size=30
```

**Explanation:**

*   `worker.list`:  Defines the list of workers (Tomcat instances) to which Apache can connect.
*   `worker.worker1.type=ajp13`:  Specifies the protocol to use (AJP).
*   `worker.worker1.host=localhost`:  The hostname or IP address of the Tomcat server.
*   `worker.worker1.port=8009`:  The AJP port on the Tomcat server (default is 8009). Make sure this port is enabled in your Tomcat's `server.xml` file.
*   `worker.worker1.lbfactor=1`:  Load balancing factor (higher value means more requests will be sent to this worker).
*   `worker.worker1.cachesize`, `worker.worker1.cache_timeout`, `worker.worker1.socket_keepalive`, `worker.worker1.connection_pool_size`:  Connection pooling and performance tuning parameters.  Adjust as needed for your environment.

### 3. Configure Apache Virtual Host

Configure your Apache virtual host to use `mod_jk` to forward requests to Tomcat.  Edit your virtual host configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/sites-available/yourdomain.com.conf` or `/usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`).

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/html

    <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # JK Mount points
    JkMount /* worker1

    # Log files
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

If you want to use SSL, configure your virtual host for port 443:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/html

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/ssl/certificate.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your/ssl/private.key

    <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # JK Mount points
    JkMount /* worker1

    # Log files
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `JkMount /* worker1`: This line tells `mod_jk` to forward *all* requests (`/*`) to the worker named `worker1` (defined in `workers.properties`).  You can customize this to forward only specific URLs to Tomcat. For example, `JkMount /myapp/* worker1` would forward only requests starting with `/myapp/`.
*  `SSLEngine on`: enables SSL
*  `SSLCertificateFile` and `SSLCertificateKeyFile`: paths to your SSL certificate and key

### 4. Enable the `mod_jk` Module

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo a2enmod jk
```

On CentOS/RHEL, `mod_jk` should be enabled by default.

### 5. Restart Apache

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo systemctl restart httpd    # CentOS/RHEL
```

### 6. Configure Tomcat's `server.xml`

Ensure the AJP connector is enabled in Tomcat's `server.xml` file (usually located in `TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml`).

```xml
<Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" address="::1"/>
```

or

```xml
<Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" address="0.0.0.0"/>
```

**Important:**  The `address` attribute specifies the IP address on which Tomcat will listen for AJP connections. `::1` is the IPv6 loopback address.  `0.0.0.0` listens on all interfaces.  If Apache and Tomcat are on different machines, you should specify the IP address of the Tomcat server.  You might need to adjust firewall settings to allow connections to port 8009.

### 7. Restart Tomcat

```bash
# Adjust based on your Tomcat setup
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
```

### 8. Test the Configuration

Access your website in your browser (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`). If the configuration is correct, you should see your Tomcat-deployed web application.

## Method 2: Using mod_proxy

This method uses Apache's `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_http`, and `mod_proxy_ajp` (if using AJP) modules.  `mod_proxy_balancer` can be used for load balancing across multiple Tomcat instances.

### 1. Enable Required Apache Modules

Enable the necessary Apache modules:

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy_ajp  # Only if using AJP
sudo a2enmod lbmethod_byrequests # Required for Load Balancing
sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer # Required for Load Balancing
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

### 2. Configure Apache Virtual Host

Edit your virtual host configuration file.  Here are examples for both HTTP and AJP proxying:

**HTTP Proxy (Recommended):**

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/html

    <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

    # Log files
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

If you are using SSL, then this configuration applies.

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/html

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your/ssl/certificate.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your/ssl/private.key

    <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

    # Log files
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**AJP Proxy:**

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/html

    <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ProxyPass / ajp://localhost:8009/
    ProxyPassReverse / ajp://localhost:8009/

    # Log files
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/`:  This line forwards all requests (`/`) to Tomcat running on `localhost:8080` using HTTP.  Use `ajp://localhost:8009/` for AJP.  You can specify a different URL path if you only want to forward requests matching that path (e.g., `ProxyPass /myapp/ http://localhost:8080/myapp/`).
*   `ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/`: This is crucial for handling redirects and rewriting response headers. It ensures that Tomcat-generated redirects and URLs are correctly rewritten to use the Apache server's address.

**Load Balancing with mod_proxy (HTTP Example):**

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/html

    <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/html>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    <Proxy balancer://mycluster>
        BalancerMember http://localhost:8080 route=node1
        BalancerMember http://localhost:8081 route=node2
        ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
    </Proxy>

    ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/
    ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/

    # Log files
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/yourdomain.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `<Proxy balancer://mycluster>`: Defines a load balancer named `mycluster`.
*   `BalancerMember http://localhost:8080 route=node1`:  Defines a backend Tomcat instance at `localhost:8080` and assigns it the route `node1`.  You can add more `BalancerMember` lines for each Tomcat instance. Ensure each Tomcat instance has a unique name.
*   `ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests`: Specifies the load balancing method (in this case, by requests). Other methods include `bytraffic`, `bybusyness`, and `heartbeat`.
*   `ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/`:  Forwards all requests to the `mycluster` load balancer.
*   `route`: Route is the name of the jsession id used as the sticky session

### 3. Restart Apache

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo systemctl restart httpd    # CentOS/RHEL
```

### 4. Configure Tomcat's `server.xml` (Optional for HTTP, Required for AJP)

**HTTP:** Tomcat's default HTTP connector (usually on port 8080) should already be configured to accept requests. You might need to adjust the `address` attribute if you want Tomcat to listen on a specific IP address.

**AJP:** Ensure the AJP connector is enabled, as described in the `mod_jk` section.

### 5. Test the Configuration

Access your website in your browser (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`). If configured correctly, you should see your Tomcat-deployed web application. If using load balancing, test by making multiple requests and verifying that they are distributed across the different Tomcat instances. You can check the Tomcat logs to see which instance handled each request.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Check Apache Error Logs:** The Apache error logs (specified in the `ErrorLog` directive) are your first stop for troubleshooting. Look for error messages related to `mod_jk` or `mod_proxy`.
*   **Check Tomcat Logs:** The Tomcat logs (usually in the `logs` directory within the Tomcat installation) can provide valuable information about request processing.
*   **Firewall Issues:** Ensure that your firewall is not blocking communication between Apache and Tomcat.
*   **Incorrect Port Numbers:** Double-check that the port numbers specified in your configuration files (e.g., `workers.properties`, virtual host configuration) match the actual ports on which Tomcat is listening.
*   **Module Not Enabled:** Make sure that the necessary Apache modules (e.g., `mod_jk`, `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_http`) are enabled.
*   **SELinux/AppArmor:**  If you are using SELinux or AppArmor, ensure that they are not preventing Apache from accessing Tomcat. You may need to adjust the SELinux or AppArmor policies.  A temporary workaround (not recommended for production) is to disable SELinux or AppArmor to see if it resolves the issue.
*   **AJP Connector Configuration:** When using `mod_jk` or AJP proxying, ensure the AJP connector in Tomcat's `server.xml` is correctly configured, especially the `address` attribute.
*   **ProxyPreserveHost:** In some scenarios with `mod_proxy`, you may need to add `ProxyPreserveHost On` to your virtual host configuration to ensure that the original host header is passed to Tomcat. This can be important for applications that rely on the host header.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided a comprehensive overview of how to integrate Apache HTTP Server with Tomcat using `mod_jk` and `mod_proxy`. By leveraging the strengths of both servers, you can create a robust, scalable, and secure web application infrastructure. Remember to carefully plan your configuration based on your specific requirements and to thoroughly test your setup before deploying it to production.  `mod_proxy` with HTTP(S) is becoming the more common and recommended approach, but `mod_jk` remains a viable option in some cases.  Good luck!
