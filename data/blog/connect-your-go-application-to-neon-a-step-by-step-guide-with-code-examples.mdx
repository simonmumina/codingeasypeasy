# Connect Your Go Application to Neon: A Step-by-Step Guide with Code Examples

Neon is a fully managed, serverless Postgres database designed for modern applications. Its serverless nature makes it an excellent choice for applications requiring scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of management. This guide will walk you through connecting your Go (Golang) application to a Neon database, providing practical code examples along the way.

## What is Neon?

Before diving into the code, let's briefly understand what Neon offers:

- **Serverless:** Neon automatically scales resources based on demand, eliminating the need for manual provisioning and management.
- **Branching:** Create isolated database branches for development, testing, or feature experimentation, without affecting your production data.
- **Scalability:** Easily handle increased workloads without performance bottlenecks.
- **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for what you use, reducing infrastructure costs.
- **Postgres Compatibility:** Enjoy the benefits of a full-featured PostgreSQL database with serverless capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Go Installed:** Make sure you have Go installed and configured on your system. You can download it from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
- **Neon Account:** Create a free account at [https://neon.tech/](https://neon.tech/).
- **Neon Project & Database:** Create a new project and database within your Neon account. You'll need the database connection string for the next steps.
- **Basic Go Knowledge:** Familiarity with Go syntax, package management, and database interactions is assumed.

## Step 1: Obtain Your Neon Connection String

After creating your project and database in Neon, you need the connection string to connect from your Go application. Follow these steps:

1.  Log in to your Neon account.
2.  Select your project.
3.  Navigate to the "Connection Details" section. You'll find the connection string in various formats (e.g., libpq, JDBC). We will focus on the standard `libpq` format, suitable for Go's `database/sql` package.

The connection string will look something like this (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```
postgres://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?sslmode=require
```

**Important:** Treat your connection string as a secret. Avoid committing it directly to your code repository. Use environment variables (as shown in the examples below) to store and access it securely.

## Step 2: Install the `pq` Driver

Go's `database/sql` package provides a generic interface for interacting with databases. You need a specific driver to connect to PostgreSQL. The most popular and well-maintained driver is `pq`.

Install it using the following command:

```plaintext
go get github.com/lib/pq
```

## Step 3: Create a Go Project and Connect to Neon

Create a new Go project (if you don't already have one) and create a file named `main.go`. Here's a basic example of how to connect to your Neon database:

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	_ "github.com/lib/pq" // Import the pq driver
)

func main() {
	// Retrieve the connection string from the environment variable.
	connStr := os.Getenv("NEON_DATABASE_URL")
	if connStr == "" {
		log.Fatal("NEON_DATABASE_URL environment variable not set")
	}

	// Open a database connection.
	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// Test the connection by pinging the database.
	err = db.Ping()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Successfully connected to Neon!")

	// Example query (optional):  Retrieve a list of databases.
	rows, err := db.Query("SELECT datname FROM pg_database;")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer rows.Close()

	fmt.Println("\nDatabases:")
	for rows.Next() {
		var dbname string
		if err := rows.Scan(&dbname); err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		fmt.Println(dbname)
	}

	if err := rows.Err(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("\nConnection closed.")
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Import Packages:** We import the necessary packages: `database/sql` for database interaction, `fmt` for printing output, `log` for error handling, `os` for accessing environment variables, and `github.com/lib/pq` (aliased as `_`) to register the PostgreSQL driver. The blank import `_ "github.com/lib/pq"` is crucial; it registers the driver without explicitly using it in the code.
- **Environment Variable:** The connection string is retrieved from the `NEON_DATABASE_URL` environment variable using `os.Getenv()`. This is the preferred way to manage sensitive connection information.
- **`sql.Open()`:** This function opens a database connection. The first argument is the driver name ("postgres" for PostgreSQL), and the second is the connection string.
- **`defer db.Close()`:** This ensures the database connection is closed when the `main` function exits. It's important to close connections to release resources.
- **`db.Ping()`:** This tests the connection to the database. If there's an error, the program will exit.
- **Example Query:** The code includes an optional example query to retrieve a list of databases. This demonstrates a simple interaction with the Neon database.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is included throughout the code to catch and report any issues during the connection or query process.

**To run this code:**

1.  Set the `NEON_DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your terminal:

    ```plaintext
    export NEON_DATABASE_URL="postgres://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]?sslmode=require"
    ```

    (Replace the placeholders with your actual Neon connection details.)

2.  Run the Go program:

    ```plaintext
    go run main.go
    ```

You should see the "Successfully connected to Neon!" message and a list of databases if the connection is successful.

## Step 4: Performing Database Operations (CRUD)

Now that you're connected, let's perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. First, let's create a simple table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

You can execute this SQL statement directly in the Neon console or using a database management tool connected to your Neon database.

Now, let's add code examples for each CRUD operation in your `main.go` file.

**Create (Insert):**

```go
func createUser(db *sql.DB, name, email string) (int, error) {
	sqlStatement := `
	INSERT INTO users (name, email)
	VALUES ($1, $2)
	RETURNING id`
	var id int
	err := db.QueryRow(sqlStatement, name, email).Scan(&id)
	if err != nil {
		return 0, err
	}
	return id, nil
}

// Example usage in main():
userID, err := createUser(db, "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Printf("Created user with ID: %d\n", userID)
```

**Read (Select):**

```go
func getUser(db *sql.DB, id int) (string, string, error) {
	sqlStatement := `SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = $1`
	var name, email string
	row := db.QueryRow(sqlStatement, id)
	err := row.Scan(&name, &email)
	if err != nil {
		if err == sql.ErrNoRows {
			return "", "", fmt.Errorf("no user found with id: %d", id)
		}
		return "", "", err
	}
	return name, email, nil
}

// Example usage in main():
name, email, err := getUser(db, 1) // Assuming a user with ID 1 exists
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Printf("User ID 1: Name = %s, Email = %s\n", name, email)
```

**Update:**

```go
func updateUserEmail(db *sql.DB, id int, newEmail string) error {
	sqlStatement := `
	UPDATE users
	SET email = $2
	WHERE id = $1`
	result, err := db.Exec(sqlStatement, id, newEmail)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	rowsAffected, err := result.RowsAffected()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if rowsAffected == 0 {
		return fmt.Errorf("no user found with id: %d", id)
	}
	return nil
}

// Example usage in main():
err = updateUserEmail(db, 1, "john.doe.updated@example.com")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println("User email updated successfully!")
```

**Delete:**

```go
func deleteUser(db *sql.DB, id int) error {
	sqlStatement := `
	DELETE FROM users
	WHERE id = $1`
	result, err := db.Exec(sqlStatement, id)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	rowsAffected, err := result.RowsAffected()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if rowsAffected == 0 {
		return fmt.Errorf("no user found with id: %d", id)
	}
	return nil
}

// Example usage in main():
err = deleteUser(db, 1)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println("User deleted successfully!")
```

**Important Considerations for CRUD Operations:**

- **Prepared Statements:** For improved performance and security (to prevent SQL injection), use prepared statements when executing queries multiple times. `db.Prepare()` can be used for this.
- **Transactions:** Use transactions (`db.Begin()`, `tx.Commit()`, `tx.Rollback()`) to ensure data consistency when performing multiple related database operations.
- **Error Handling:** Thorough error handling is crucial for reliable applications. Always check for errors after each database operation.
- **SQL Injection:** Always sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Prepared statements help with this.

## Step 5: Connection Pooling

Opening and closing database connections for each request can be resource-intensive. Connection pooling is a technique that reuses existing database connections, improving performance. The `database/sql` package provides built-in connection pooling.

You can configure the connection pool using the following methods on the `sql.DB` object:

- `SetMaxOpenConns(n int)`: Sets the maximum number of open connections to the database.
- `SetMaxIdleConns(n int)`: Sets the maximum number of idle connections in the pool.
- `SetConnMaxLifetime(d time.Duration)`: Sets the maximum amount of time a connection may be reused.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
	"time"

	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
	connStr := os.Getenv("NEON_DATABASE_URL")
	if connStr == "" {
		log.Fatal("NEON_DATABASE_URL environment variable not set")
	}

	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// Configure connection pool
	db.SetMaxOpenConns(10)   // Maximum number of open connections
	db.SetMaxIdleConns(5)    // Maximum number of idle connections
	db.SetConnMaxLifetime(time.Hour) // Maximum connection lifetime

	err = db.Ping()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Successfully connected to Neon with connection pooling!")

	// ... (rest of your code)
}
```

By configuring the connection pool, you can optimize your application's performance and reduce the overhead of establishing new database connections.

## Best Practices for Go and Neon
