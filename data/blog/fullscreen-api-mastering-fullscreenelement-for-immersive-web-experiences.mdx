# Fullscreen API: Mastering `fullscreenElement` for Immersive Web Experiences

The Fullscreen API is a powerful web standard that allows you to display a specific HTML element in full-screen mode. This opens up a world of possibilities for creating immersive web applications, from video players and games to presentations and image galleries. A crucial aspect of working with the Fullscreen API is understanding and utilizing the `fullscreenElement` property. This post will delve deep into `fullscreenElement`, explaining what it is, how it works, and providing practical code examples to help you implement it effectively.

## What is the `fullscreenElement` Property?

The `fullscreenElement` property of the `document` object provides valuable information about the current fullscreen state of your web page. Specifically, it tells you _which_ element, if any, is currently being displayed in fullscreen.

- **Value:** The `fullscreenElement` property returns a reference to the HTML element currently displayed in fullscreen.
- **`null`:** If no element is currently in fullscreen mode, the `fullscreenElement` property returns `null`.

Think of it as a "pointer" to the element taking up the entire screen. This is especially useful for:

- **Checking Fullscreen State:** Determining whether or not the browser is in fullscreen mode.
- **Identifying the Fullscreen Element:** Knowing which element is currently fullscreen, allowing you to apply specific styling or behavior to it.
- **Handling Events:** Responding appropriately when an element enters or exits fullscreen mode.

## Browser Support

The Fullscreen API and, therefore, the `fullscreenElement` property is widely supported across modern browsers. However, slight differences exist in the prefixes used. Here's a general overview:

- **Chrome/Edge/Opera/Safari:** Use the standard `document.fullscreenElement` (without prefixes).
- **Firefox:** Uses `document.mozFullScreenElement` (with the `moz` prefix).
- **Internet Explorer:** Uses `document.msFullscreenElement` (with the `ms` prefix).

To ensure cross-browser compatibility, you'll typically need to use a function that checks for these different prefixes.

## Code Examples

Let's explore several code examples to illustrate how to effectively use the `fullscreenElement` property.

### 1. Checking if the Browser is in Fullscreen Mode

This is the most basic use case. We can use `fullscreenElement` to determine if any element is in fullscreen.

```plaintext
function isFullscreen() {
  return (
    document.fullscreenElement ||
    document.mozFullScreenElement ||
    document.webkitFullscreenElement ||
    document.msFullscreenElement
  );
}

function logFullscreenStatus() {
  if (isFullscreen()) {
    console.log("The browser is currently in fullscreen mode.");
    console.log("Fullscreen Element:", isFullscreen()); // log the element itself
  } else {
    console.log("The browser is NOT in fullscreen mode.");
  }
}

// Call this function to check the status
logFullscreenStatus();
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`isFullscreen()` function:** This function checks for the existence of `fullscreenElement` (or its prefixed versions) on the `document` object. If any of them exist and return a truthy value (i.e., a reference to an element), it means the browser is in fullscreen mode.
2.  **`logFullscreenStatus()` function:** This function calls `isFullscreen()` and logs a message to the console indicating whether or not the browser is in fullscreen mode. It also logs the element that is currently in fullscreen, which is the element that `isFullscreen()` returns.

### 2. Identifying the Fullscreen Element

If you need to know _which_ specific element is in fullscreen, you can directly access the `fullscreenElement` property.

```plaintext
function getFullscreenElement() {
  return (
    document.fullscreenElement ||
    document.mozFullScreenElement ||
    document.webkitFullscreenElement ||
    document.msFullscreenElement
  );
}

function handleFullscreenChange() {
  const fullscreenElement = getFullscreenElement();

  if (fullscreenElement) {
    console.log("Element in fullscreen:", fullscreenElement);
    // You can now apply specific styling or behavior to the fullscreen element
    fullscreenElement.classList.add("fullscreen-element"); // Add a class for custom styling
  } else {
    console.log("Exited fullscreen mode.");
    const elementWithFullscreenClass = document.querySelector(".fullscreen-element");
    if(elementWithFullscreenClass){
        elementWithFullscreenClass.classList.remove("fullscreen-element"); // Remove the class when exiting fullscreen
    }

  }
}

// Attach the event listener to the document
document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", handleFullscreenChange);
document.addEventListener("mozfullscreenchange", handleFullscreenChange); // Firefox
document.addEventListener("webkitfullscreenchange", handleFullscreenChange); // Safari, Chrome, Opera
document.addEventListener("msfullscreenchange", handleFullscreenChange); // IE

// Example: Trigger fullscreen on a specific element (e.g., a video)
const videoElement = document.getElementById("myVideo");
if (videoElement) {
  videoElement.addEventListener("dblclick", function() {
    if (videoElement.requestFullscreen) {
      videoElement.requestFullscreen();
    } else if (videoElement.mozRequestFullScreen) { /* Firefox */
      videoElement.mozRequestFullScreen();
    } else if (videoElement.webkitRequestFullscreen) { /* Chrome, Safari and Opera */
      videoElement.webkitRequestFullscreen();
    } else if (videoElement.msRequestFullscreen) { /* IE/Edge */
      videoElement.msRequestFullscreen();
    }
  });
} else {
  console.warn("Video element with ID 'myVideo' not found.");
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`getFullscreenElement()` function:** This function retrieves the current fullscreen element, handling browser prefixes as needed. It returns `null` if no element is in fullscreen.
2.  **`handleFullscreenChange()` function:** This function is called whenever the fullscreen state changes (an element enters or exits fullscreen).
    - It gets the fullscreen element using `getFullscreenElement()`.
    - If an element is in fullscreen, it logs the element to the console and adds a CSS class (`fullscreen-element`) to it. You can then use CSS to style this element differently when it's in fullscreen.
    - If the fullscreen mode is exited (the `fullscreenElement` becomes `null`), it logs a message and removes the `fullscreen-element` class from the element.
3.  **Event Listeners:** The `fullscreenchange` event is fired whenever the fullscreen state changes. We attach event listeners for each of the prefixed versions of this event to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
4.  **Fullscreen Trigger:** The example shows how to trigger fullscreen mode on a video element (`myVideo`) when the user double-clicks it. It uses the appropriate prefixed `requestFullscreen` method based on the browser. This part is crucial for _entering_ fullscreen.

### 3. Applying Styles Based on Fullscreen State

This example shows how to dynamically apply styles to an element based on its fullscreen state.

```plaintext
function applyFullscreenStyles() {
  const fullscreenElement = getFullscreenElement();

  if (fullscreenElement) {
    fullscreenElement.style.backgroundColor = "black";
    fullscreenElement.style.color = "white";
    fullscreenElement.style.padding = "20px";
  } else {
      const elementWithFullscreenStyles = document.querySelector(".fullscreen-element");
      if(elementWithFullscreenStyles) {
        // Reset styles if element had fullscreen styles applied
        elementWithFullscreenStyles.style.backgroundColor = "";
        elementWithFullscreenStyles.style.color = "";
        elementWithFullscreenStyles.style.padding = "";
      }
  }
}

// Call this function whenever the fullscreen state changes
document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", applyFullscreenStyles);
document.addEventListener("mozfullscreenchange", applyFullscreenStyles);
document.addEventListener("webkitfullscreenchange", applyFullscreenStyles);
document.addEventListener("msfullscreenchange", applyFullscreenStyles);
```

**Explanation:**

This example builds on the previous one. The `applyFullscreenStyles()` function is called whenever the fullscreen state changes. If an element is in fullscreen, it sets its `backgroundColor`, `color`, and `padding` properties. When the element exits fullscreen, these styles are removed.

**Best Practice:** For more complex styling, consider using CSS classes as shown in the previous example instead of directly manipulating the element's `style` property.

### 4. Exiting Fullscreen Mode

You can also programmatically exit fullscreen mode.

```plaintext
function exitFullscreen() {
  if (document.exitFullscreen) {
    document.exitFullscreen();
  } else if (document.mozCancelFullScreen) { /* Firefox */
    document.mozCancelFullScreen();
  } else if (document.webkitExitFullscreen) { /* Chrome, Safari and Opera */
    document.webkitExitFullscreen();
  } else if (document.msExitFullscreen) { /* IE/Edge */
    document.msExitFullscreen();
  }
}

// Example: Add a button to exit fullscreen
const exitFullscreenButton = document.getElementById("exitFullscreenButton");

if(exitFullscreenButton) {
    exitFullscreenButton.addEventListener("click", exitFullscreen);
} else {
    console.warn("Exit Fullscreen button with ID 'exitFullscreenButton' not found.")
}

```

**Explanation:**

The `exitFullscreen()` function uses the appropriate method (with prefixes) to exit fullscreen mode. We add a button that, when clicked, calls this function. Remember to handle the potential absence of the button element with appropriate checks.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Browser Prefixes:** Always handle browser prefixes (e.g., `mozFullScreenElement`, `webkitFullscreenElement`) to ensure cross-browser compatibility. The helper functions shown in the examples simplify this process.
- **User Experience:** Provide clear indicators to the user that an element is in fullscreen mode (e.g., custom styling, controls). Also, make it easy for users to exit fullscreen mode (e.g., a prominent "Exit Fullscreen" button or by pressing the `Esc` key).
- **Event Handling:** Use the `fullscreenchange` event to detect changes in the fullscreen state and update your UI accordingly.
- **Error Handling:** Consider scenarios where the Fullscreen API might not be available (e.g., in older browsers or if the user has disabled fullscreen functionality in their browser settings).
- **Security:** Be aware that the Fullscreen API might be restricted in certain contexts (e.g., within iframes).
