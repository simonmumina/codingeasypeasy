# Comprehensive Guide: Fetching Data in Next.js (Best Practices & Examples)

Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides a variety of data fetching options, allowing you to choose the best approach for your specific needs. Understanding these options is crucial for building performant and SEO-friendly applications. This comprehensive guide explores the different ways to fetch data in Next.js, complete with code examples and best practices.

## Why is Data Fetching Important in Next.js?

Data fetching is the process of retrieving data from a data source (e.g., an API, a database, or a file system) and making it available to your components. In Next.js, the way you fetch data significantly impacts:

- **Performance:** Different data fetching methods have different performance characteristics, such as loading speed and server load.
- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Search engines can only index content that is available when they crawl your website. Server-side rendered or statically generated content is more easily indexed than client-side rendered content.
- **User Experience:** Faster loading times and relevant content improve user satisfaction.

## Data Fetching Methods in Next.js

Next.js offers several data fetching methods, each with its own use cases:

1.  **`getServerSideProps` (Server-Side Rendering - SSR):**
2.  **`getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation - SSG):**
3.  **`getStaticPaths` (Dynamic Routes - SSG):**
4.  **Client-Side Data Fetching (using `useEffect`):**
5.  **API Routes:**
6.  **Data Fetching Libraries (SWR, TanStack Query):**

Let's explore each of these methods in detail.

### 1. `getServerSideProps` (Server-Side Rendering - SSR)

`getServerSideProps` runs on every request. This means that the data is fetched and the page is rendered on the server each time a user visits the page.

**Use Cases:**

- Dynamic content that changes frequently.
- Personalized content based on user authentication or other request-specific data.
- When you need the most up-to-date data possible.

**Code Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/index.js
function HomePage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Server-Side Rendered Data</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}

export default HomePage;
```

**Explanation:**

- `getServerSideProps` is an `async` function that is exported from the page component.
- It receives a `context` object containing information about the request, such as query parameters and headers.
- Inside `getServerSideProps`, we fetch data from an API using `fetch`.
- We return an object with a `props` property. The values in the `props` object are passed as props to the page component.
- The `HomePage` component then receives the `data` prop and renders the list of items.

**Pros:**

- Always displays the most up-to-date data.
- Good for SEO as the content is rendered on the server.

**Cons:**

- Slower page load times compared to SSG because the server needs to render the page on every request.
- Higher server load.

### 2. `getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation - SSG)

`getStaticProps` runs during the build process. The data is fetched at build time and the page is rendered as static HTML. This is generally the preferred method when your data doesn't change frequently.

**Use Cases:**

- Content that is not personalized or does not change frequently (e.g., blog posts, documentation).
- When you want the fastest possible page load times.
- When you want to minimize server load.

**Code Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/about.js
function AboutPage({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Static Site Generated Data</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://your-api.com/about');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
    revalidate: 60, // Optional: regenerate the page every 60 seconds
  };
}

export default AboutPage;
```

**Explanation:**

- `getStaticProps` is an `async` function that is exported from the page component.
- It fetches data at build time.
- The `revalidate` property (optional) specifies how often Next.js should regenerate the page in the background. This is called Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR). In this example, the page will be regenerated every 60 seconds.

**Pros:**

- Extremely fast page load times because the page is already pre-rendered.
- Low server load.
- Excellent for SEO.

**Cons:**

- Not suitable for dynamic content that changes frequently without `revalidate`.
- Data is only updated at build time (or when `revalidate` triggers a rebuild).

### 3. `getStaticPaths` (Dynamic Routes - SSG)

`getStaticPaths` is used in conjunction with `getStaticProps` for dynamically routed pages. It defines which paths should be statically generated at build time. This is essential when you have dynamic route parameters (e.g., `/blog/[id]`).

**Use Cases:**

- Dynamically routed pages where you want to pre-render specific paths.
- Blog posts with individual pages for each post.
- Product pages in an e-commerce store.

**Code Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/posts/[id].js
function Post({ post }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.body}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id.toString() },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false, // Required: See below for options
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${params.id}`);
  const post = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}

export default Post;
```

**Explanation:**

- `getStaticPaths` is an `async` function that is exported from the page component.
- It fetches a list of possible values for the dynamic route parameter (in this case, `id`).
- It returns an object with a `paths` property, which is an array of objects, each containing a `params` object with the route parameters.
- The `fallback` property determines what happens when a user visits a path that was not pre-rendered at build time.
  - `fallback: false`: Returns a 404 page if the path was not pre-rendered.
  - `fallback: true`: Next.js will attempt to generate the page on-demand. The first request to the un-rendered path will show a loading state. Once generated, the page will be cached and served statically on subsequent requests.
  - `fallback: 'blocking'`: The first request to the un-rendered path will be served by the server. The user waits until the page is generated and then receives the fully rendered page. After that, the page is cached and served statically.
- `getStaticProps` receives a `params` object containing the route parameters for the current request.
- It fetches the data for the specific post based on the `id` parameter.

**Pros:**

- Enables static generation for dynamically routed pages.
- Improves performance and SEO for dynamically routed content.

**Cons:**

- Requires careful planning and consideration of the `fallback` property.
- Can be complex to set up for large datasets.

### 4. Client-Side Data Fetching (using `useEffect`)

Client-side data fetching is done in the browser using JavaScript. This is useful for fetching data that is specific to the user or that changes frequently.

**Use Cases:**

- User-specific data.
- Data that updates in real-time.
- When you need to perform complex logic in the browser before fetching data.

**Code Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/profile.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ProfilePage() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const res = await fetch('/api/profile'); // Fetch from an API route
        const data = await res.json();
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs only once after initial render

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (!data) {
    return <p>Error loading profile data.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {data.name}!</h1>
      <p>Email: {data.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ProfilePage;
```

**Explanation:**

- We use the `useState` hook to store the data and a loading state.
- We use the `useEffect` hook to fetch the data when the component mounts.
- We use an empty dependency array `[]` in `useEffect` to ensure that the effect only runs once after the initial render.
- We fetch data from an API route (`/api/profile`). (See API Routes section below)
- We update the state with the fetched data.
- We handle loading and error states.

**Pros:**

- Flexible and easy to implement for simple data fetching scenarios.
- Good for fetching user-specific data.

**Cons:**

- Can lead to slower initial page load times and a poor user experience if not implemented carefully.
- Not ideal for SEO because the content is rendered in the browser after the initial page load.
- Requires handling loading and error states.

### 5. API Routes

Next.js allows you to create API routes directly within your application. These routes run on the server and can be used to fetch data from a database or other external source. This approach is particularly useful when you need to perform server-side logic before returning data to the client.

**Use Cases:**

- Fetching data from a database.
- Performing server-side logic before returning data.
- Creating APIs for your Next.js application.

**Code Example:**

```plaintext
// pages/api/profile.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // Simulate fetching data from a database
  const profileData = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  };

  res.status(200).json(profileData);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- API routes are created in the `pages/api` directory.
- The `handler` function receives a `req` (request) object and a `res` (response) object.
- We can perform any server-side logic in the `handler` function, such as fetching data from a database.
- We use `res.status(200).json()` to send a JSON response back to the client.

**Using the API Route with `useEffect` (from previous example):**

The `/api/profile` endpoint created above can then be used in the `useEffect` example shown previously.

**Pros:**

- Allows you to perform server-side logic before returning data to the client.
- Provides a secure way to access sensitive data, such as database credentials.

**Cons:**

- Requires you to write server-side code.
- Can add complexity to your application.

### 6. Data Fetching Libraries (SWR, TanStack Query)

SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) and TanStack Query (formerly React Query) are popular data fetching libraries that provide a more robust and efficient way to fetch data in React and Next.js applications.

**SWR:**

SWR is a React Hooks library for data fetching. It handles caching, revalidation, and error handling automatically.

**TanStack Query:**

TanStack Query is a powerful asynchronous state management library for fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in web applications.

**Use Cases:**

- Complex data fetching scenarios where you need caching, revalidation, and error handling.
- When you want to improve the performance and user experience of your application.

**Code Example (SWR):**

```plaintext
// pages/swr-example.js
import useSWR from 'swr';

const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then(res => res.json());

function SWRPage() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', fetcher);

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>SWR Data Fetching</h1>
      <p>Title: {data.title}</p>
      <p>Completed: {data.completed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SWRPage;
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `useSWR` hook from the `swr` library.
- We define a `fetcher` function that fetches the data from the API.
- We call `useSWR` with the URL of the API and the `fetcher` function.
- `useSWR` returns `data` and `error` objects.
- We handle loading and error states.

**Code Example (TanStack Query):**

```plaintext
// pages/tanstack-query-example.js
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const fetcher = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
  return res.json();
};

function TanStackQueryPage() {
  const { isLoading, error, data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['todo'],
    queryFn: fetcher,
  });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>An error has occurred: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>TanStack Query Data Fetching</h1>
      <p>Title: {data.title}</p>
      <p>Completed: {data.completed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TanStackQueryPage;
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query`.
- We define a `fetcher` function that fetches the data from the API.
- We call `useQuery` with a `queryKey` and `queryFn`. The `queryKey` is a unique identifier for the query.
- `useQuery` returns `isLoading`, `error`, and `data` objects.
- We handle loading and error states.

**Pros (SWR & TanStack Query):**

- Simplified data fetching with built-in caching, revalidation, and error handling.
- Improved performance and user experience.
- Reduced boilerplate code.

**Cons (SWR & TanStack Query):**

- Requires learning a new library.
- Can add complexity to your application if not used carefully.

## Choosing the Right Data Fetching Method

The best data fetching method for your Next.js application depends on your specific needs:

- **Use `getStaticProps`** when your data is not personalized and does not change frequently.
- **Use `getServerSideProps`** when you need the most up-to-date data possible and personalization is required.
- **Use `getStaticPaths`** in conjunction with `getStaticProps` for dynamically routed pages.
- **Use client-side data fetching with `useEffect`** for user-specific data or data that updates in real-time, especially if you are using a library like SWR or TanStack Query.
- **Use API Routes** to fetch data from a database or perform server-side logic.
- **Consider SWR or TanStack Query** for more complex data fetching scenarios where you need caching, revalidation, and error handling.

## Best Practices for Data Fetching in Next.js

- **Cache your data whenever possible** to improve performance.
- **Handle loading and error states** to provide a good user experience.
- **Optimize your API endpoints** to reduce latency.
- **Use data fetching libraries** like SWR or TanStack Query to simplify data fetching and improve performance.
