# AnimationEvent elapsedTime: Mastering Animation Timing in JavaScript

Animations are crucial for creating engaging and dynamic web experiences. The `AnimationEvent` interface in JavaScript provides valuable information about CSS animations, and the `elapsedTime` property is a key component for precisely controlling and synchronizing these animations. This blog post will dive deep into the `AnimationEvent.elapsedTime` property, exploring its functionality, usage, and providing practical code examples to help you master animation timing in your web projects.

## What is the AnimationEvent Interface?

Before diving into `elapsedTime`, let's briefly understand the `AnimationEvent` interface. This interface represents events related to CSS animations. It provides properties like `animationName`, `elapsedTime`, `pseudoElement`, and `eventPhase` that offer insights into the state and progress of an animation. These events are fired when a CSS animation starts, ends, or iterates. You can listen for these events using JavaScript's `addEventListener`.

## Understanding the `elapsedTime` Property

The `elapsedTime` property of the `AnimationEvent` interface represents the amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, when the event fired. This includes any time spent in delay iterations. It's a floating-point number, allowing for precise timing information.

**Key takeaways about `elapsedTime`:**

- **Unit:** Seconds.
- **Value:** A floating-point number representing the elapsed time.
- **Accuracy:** Provides precise timing information, crucial for synchronization.
- **Includes Delay:** Accounts for any `animation-delay` specified in your CSS.
- **Read-only:** The value of `elapsedTime` cannot be modified directly.

## Basic Usage: Logging Elapsed Time

Let's start with a simple example. We'll create a basic CSS animation and log the `elapsedTime` to the console when the animation starts, iterates, and ends.

**HTML (`index.html`):**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Animation Event Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="box"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**CSS (`style.css`):**

```plaintext
#box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: changeColor;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-delay: 1s;
}

@keyframes changeColor {
  0% { background-color: red; }
  50% { background-color: blue; }
  100% { background-color: red; }
}
```

**JavaScript (`script.js`):**

```javascript
const box = document.getElementById('box')

box.addEventListener('animationstart', (event) => {
  console.log('Animation started. Elapsed time:', event.elapsedTime)
})

box.addEventListener('animationiteration', (event) => {
  console.log('Animation iterated. Elapsed time:', event.elapsedTime)
})

box.addEventListener('animationend', (event) => {
  console.log('Animation ended. Elapsed time:', event.elapsedTime)
})
```

In this example:

- We define a CSS animation named `changeColor` that changes the background color of the `box` element.
- We attach event listeners for `animationstart`, `animationiteration`, and `animationend` events to the `box` element.
- Inside each event listener, we log the `event.elapsedTime` to the console.

When you open `index.html` in your browser, you'll see messages in the console showing the elapsed time when each event occurs. Notice how the `animationstart` event's `elapsedTime` will be equal to the `animation-delay` (1 second in this case). The `animationiteration` event will fire after each full cycle of the animation (including the delay), and the `animationend` will fire when `animation-iteration-count` is not infinite and the last iteration completes.

## Advanced Usage: Synchronizing Multiple Animations

The real power of `elapsedTime` comes into play when you need to synchronize multiple animations or trigger actions based on specific points in an animation's timeline. Let's create an example where we trigger a second animation based on the `elapsedTime` of the first animation.

**HTML (`index.html` - Updated):**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Animation Event Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="box1"></div>
    <div id="box2"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**CSS (`style.css` - Updated):**

```plaintext
#box1 {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: moveBox;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-iteration-count: 1;
  position: relative;
}

#box2 {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: green;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 120px; /* Position box2 next to box1 initially */
  opacity: 0; /* Hide box2 initially */
  animation-name: fadeAndMove;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: 1;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards; /* Ensure the final state is retained */
}

@keyframes moveBox {
  0% { left: 0; }
  100% { left: 200px; }
}

@keyframes fadeAndMove {
  0% { opacity: 0; left: 120px;}
  100% { opacity: 1; left: 300px; }
}
```

**JavaScript (`script.js` - Updated):**

```javascript
const box1 = document.getElementById('box1')
const box2 = document.getElementById('box2')

box1.addEventListener('animationiteration', (event) => {
  console.log('Box 1 animation iterated.')
})

box1.addEventListener('animationend', (event) => {
  console.log('Box 1 animation ended. Elapsed time:', event.elapsedTime)
  box2.style.animationPlayState = 'running' // Start box2's animation
})

// Ensure box2 animation is paused initially.  The 'running' state is set on animationend of box1.
box2.style.animationPlayState = 'paused'
```

In this example:

- We have two boxes, `box1` and `box2`.
- `box1` has an animation called `moveBox` that moves it horizontally.
- `box2` has an animation called `fadeAndMove` that makes it fade in and move. It's initially hidden with `opacity: 0;`
- We listen for the `animationend` event on `box1`.
- When `box1`'s animation ends (after 3 seconds), we start `box2`'s animation by setting `box2.style.animationPlayState = 'running'`.
- We explicitly pause the `box2`'s animation initially with `box2.style.animationPlayState = 'paused'`, ensuring it only runs when triggered by `box1`.

This demonstrates how you can use `elapsedTime` (indirectly, in this case, by triggering another animation on the 'end' event which is based on `elapsedTime`) to create synchronized animations. You could further refine this by using `setTimeout` within the `animationstart` listener of `box1` based on `event.elapsedTime` to precisely time the start of `box2`'s animation relative to `box1`'s progress.

## Fine-Grained Control with `requestAnimationFrame`

For even more precise control, you can combine `elapsedTime` with `requestAnimationFrame`. `requestAnimationFrame` provides a callback that's executed before the next repaint, allowing you to perform updates in sync with the browser's rendering pipeline. This can significantly improve animation performance and smoothness.

Let's say we want to change the text content of a div based on the progress of an animation.

**HTML (`index.html` - Updated):**

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Animation Event Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="animatedText">Initial Text</div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**CSS (`style.css` - Updated):**

```plaintext
#animatedText {
  font-size: 24px;
  animation: changeText 5s linear forwards; /* linear is important for predictable progress */
}

@keyframes changeText {
  0% { opacity: 1; }
  100% { opacity: 1; } /* Opacity change is just to trigger the animation, we use JS for text */
}
```

**JavaScript (`script.js` - Updated):**

```javascript
const animatedText = document.getElementById('animatedText')

animatedText.addEventListener('animationstart', (event) => {
  const animationDuration = 5 // Animation duration in seconds
  const startTime = performance.now()

  function updateText() {
    const elapsedTime = (performance.now() - startTime) / 1000 // Convert milliseconds to seconds

    // Calculate animation progress (0 to 1)
    const progress = Math.min(elapsedTime / animationDuration, 1) // Ensure it doesn't exceed 1

    // Example: Change text based on progress
    if (progress < 0.25) {
      animatedText.textContent = 'Text: 25%'
    } else if (progress < 0.5) {
      animatedText.textContent = 'Text: 50%'
    } else if (progress < 0.75) {
      animatedText.textContent = 'Text: 75%'
    } else {
      animatedText.textContent = 'Text: 100%'
    }

    // Continue animation until it's complete
    if (progress < 1) {
      requestAnimationFrame(updateText)
    }
  }

  requestAnimationFrame(updateText)
})
```

In this example:

- We trigger the animation start event. We obtain the start time, which we use as the animation base reference.
- We use `performance.now()` instead of relying solely on `AnimationEvent.elapsedTime` because we need a more consistent timer across different browsers and situations. `performance.now()` gives us the time in milliseconds since the page was loaded.
- Inside the `updateText` function, we calculate the `elapsedTime` and `progress` of the animation based on `performance.now()`.
- We change the text content of the `animatedText` element based on the `progress`.
- We use `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure that the `updateText` function is called before each repaint, resulting in a smooth animation.
- The `Math.min` function ensures that the `progress` value doesn't exceed 1 (100%). This is crucial to prevent errors when the animation has completed.
- The `animation: changeText 5s linear forwards;` is crucial. `linear` ensures that the animation progresses linearly over time, making the progress calculation more predictable. `forwards` ensures that the final state of the animation is retained.

This pattern allows for complex manipulations of the DOM based on the precise timing of an animation. You can adapt the text updates or any other DOM manipulations to match your desired animation logic.

## Browser Compatibility

The `AnimationEvent` interface and the `elapsedTime` property are widely supported across modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. However, it's always a good practice to check the latest compatibility information on resources like the MDN Web Docs ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnimationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnimationEvent)).

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Performance:** Be mindful of performance, especially when using `requestAnimationFrame`. Avoid complex calculations or DOM manipulations within the animation loop that could cause slowdowns.
- **Timing Functions:** The `animation-timing-function` CSS property (e.g., `linear`, `ease-in-out`) affects how the animation progresses over time. Understanding and controlling the timing function is crucial for accurate synchronization. `linear` is generally recommended when you need precise control over the animation progress in JavaScript.
- **Fallbacks:** Consider providing fallback mechanisms for older browsers that don't support CSS animations or the `AnimationEvent` interface. You might use JavaScript-based animation libraries like GreenSock (GSAP) or Velocity.js to achieve similar effects.
- **Mobile Devices:** Test your animations thoroughly on mobile devices to ensure they perform well and are responsive.
- **Accessibility:** Be mindful of accessibility when using animations. Ensure that animations don't cause seizures or distract users with cognitive impairments. Provide options to pause or disable animations.
- **Use `performance.now()`**: For time-sensitive operations, `performance.now()` should be preferred to ensure that you are using the same clock as other JavaScript APIs.

## Conclusion

The `AnimationEvent.elapsedTime` property, when combined with techniques like `requestAnimationFrame` and careful planning, provides a powerful toolset for creating sophisticated and synchronized animations in JavaScript. By understanding how to leverage this property, you can build more engaging and visually appealing web experiences. Remember to consider performance, accessibility, and browser compatibility when implementing animations in your projects. This guide equips you with the knowledge and code examples to confidently integrate `elapsedTime` into your animation workflows.
