# XSLT Tutorial: Transforming XML with Stylesheets - Complete Guide and Examples

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is a powerful language used for transforming XML documents into other formats. It leverages XPath for navigating the XML structure and applies templates to perform transformations. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamentals of XSLT, provide practical examples, and help you understand its applications in web development and data manipulation.

## What is XSLT?

XSLT is a declarative language that describes how to transform an XML document into another format. Unlike procedural languages, you don't explicitly specify _how_ to perform the transformation step-by-step. Instead, you define _rules_ or _templates_ that match specific elements or attributes in the XML document and specify how those matching elements should be transformed.

**Key Features of XSLT:**

- **XPath Integration:** XSLT uses XPath to navigate the XML document tree, select specific elements, and filter data based on various criteria.
- **Template-Based:** Transformations are defined as templates, which match specific XML nodes using XPath expressions.
- **Declarative Language:** You define _what_ transformations to perform, not _how_ to perform them. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Output Flexibility:** XSLT can generate output in various formats, including HTML, XHTML, text, and even other XML structures.
- **Data Manipulation:** XSLT allows for data manipulation within the transformation process, including string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and date formatting.

## Setting Up Your XSLT Environment

You don't need to install special software to start working with XSLT. Most modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) have built-in XSLT processors. However, for server-side processing and more advanced scenarios, you'll likely use a dedicated XSLT processor library within your chosen programming language (e.g., Python's `lxml`, Java's `javax.xml.transform`).

For this tutorial, we'll focus on browser-based XSLT processing to keep things simple.

## Basic XSLT Syntax

An XSLT stylesheet is an XML document itself. Here's the basic structure:

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <!-- Transformation logic here -->
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

**Explanation:**

- `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`: Standard XML declaration.
- `<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">`: The root element of the XSLT stylesheet.
  - `version="1.0"`: Specifies the XSLT version being used. (Version 2.0 and 3.0 exist but 1.0 is widely supported.)
  - `xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"`: Declares the XML namespace for XSLT elements, allowing you to use the `xsl:` prefix.
- `<xsl:template match="/">`: Defines a template. The `match` attribute specifies an XPath expression that determines which XML nodes this template will be applied to. `match="/"` means this template will be applied to the root node of the XML document.

## A Simple XSLT Example: Transforming XML to HTML

Let's start with a simple example to transform an XML document representing a book into an HTML page.

**XML Document (book.xml):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<book>
  <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
  <author>Douglas Adams</author>
  <price>10.99</price>
</book>
```

**XSLT Stylesheet (book.xsl):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Book Information</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Book Details</h1>
        <h2>Title: <xsl:value-of select="book/title"/></h2>
        <p>Author: <xsl:value-of select="book/author"/></p>
        <p>Price: $<xsl:value-of select="book/price"/></p>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

**Explanation:**

- `<xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>`: Specifies that the output should be HTML and that the output should be indented for readability.
- `<xsl:value-of select="book/title"/>`: Extracts the value of the `title` element within the `book` element. This is the core of the transformation - using XPath to select data and insert it into the output. Similarly for `author` and `price`.

**How to Run This Example in a Browser:**

To run this in a browser, you need to associate the XML document with the XSLT stylesheet using an `xml-stylesheet` processing instruction:

**Updated XML Document (book.xml):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="book.xsl"?>
<book>
  <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
  <author>Douglas Adams</author>
  <price>10.99</price>
</book>
```

Now, when you open `book.xml` in a modern browser, it will automatically apply the `book.xsl` stylesheet and display the transformed HTML output. You should see a simple HTML page with the book's title, author, and price.

## Key XSLT Elements

Here are some essential XSLT elements you'll use frequently:

- **`<xsl:template match="...">`**: Defines a template that matches nodes selected by the XPath expression in the `match` attribute.
- **`<xsl:value-of select="...">`**: Outputs the value of a node selected by the XPath expression in the `select` attribute.
- **`<xsl:for-each select="...">`**: Iterates over a set of nodes selected by the XPath expression in the `select` attribute. This is crucial for working with lists of elements.
- **`<xsl:if test="...">`**: Conditionally executes code based on the boolean result of the XPath expression in the `test` attribute.
- **`<xsl:choose>`, `<xsl:when test="...">`, `<xsl:otherwise>`**: Provides a more complex conditional structure, similar to a `switch` statement in other programming languages.
- **`<xsl:apply-templates select="...">`**: Applies templates to a set of nodes selected by the XPath expression in the `select` attribute. This is a key feature for creating reusable and modular stylesheets.
- **`<xsl:copy>`**: Copies the current node to the output.
- **`<xsl:element name="...">`**: Creates an XML element with the specified name.
- **`<xsl:attribute name="...">`**: Creates an attribute for the current element with the specified name.
- **`<xsl:text>`**: Outputs literal text. Useful for inserting static content into the output.
- **`<xsl:sort select="..." order="..." data-type="..." case-order="...">`**: Sorts the selected nodes before processing them. Can be used within `<xsl:for-each>` to control the order of iteration.

## Using `<xsl:for-each>` for Lists of Elements

Let's say you have an XML document with a list of books:

**XML Document (books.xml):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<books>
  <book>
    <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
    <author>Douglas Adams</author>
    <price>10.99</price>
  </book>
  <book>
    <title>The Lord of the Rings</title>
    <author>J.R.R. Tolkien</author>
    <price>12.50</price>
  </book>
  <book>
    <title>Pride and Prejudice</title>
    <author>Jane Austen</author>
    <price>8.75</price>
  </book>
</books>
```

**XSLT Stylesheet (books.xsl):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Book List</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Book List</h1>
        <ul>
          <xsl:for-each select="books/book">
            <li>
              <h2><xsl:value-of select="title"/></h2>
              <p>Author: <xsl:value-of select="author"/></p>
              <p>Price: $<xsl:value-of select="price"/></p>
            </li>
          </xsl:for-each>
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

**Explanation:**

- `<xsl:for-each select="books/book">`: Iterates over each `book` element within the `books` element.
- Inside the `<xsl:for-each>` loop, the `select` attributes in `<xsl:value-of>` now refer to the _current_ `book` element being processed. So `title` refers to the `title` element within the current `book`.

This stylesheet will generate an HTML page with an unordered list (`<ul>`) where each list item (`<li>`) contains the title, author, and price of a book.

## Conditional Logic with `<xsl:if>` and `<xsl:choose>`

You can use `<xsl:if>` and `<xsl:choose>` to apply transformations based on conditions. For example, let's highlight books that are more expensive than a certain price.

**XSLT Stylesheet (books_conditional.xsl):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Book List</title>
        <style>
          .expensive {
            background-color: yellow;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Book List</h1>
        <ul>
          <xsl:for-each select="books/book">
            <li>
              <xsl:if test="price > 10">
                <xsl:attribute name="class">expensive</xsl:attribute>
              </xsl:if>
              <h2><xsl:value-of select="title"/></h2>
              <p>Author: <xsl:value-of select="author"/></p>
              <p>Price: $<xsl:value-of select="price"/></p>
            </li>
          </xsl:for-each>
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

**Explanation:**

- `<xsl:if test="price > 10">`: Checks if the value of the `price` element is greater than 10.
- `<xsl:attribute name="class">expensive</xsl:attribute>`: If the condition is true, it adds a `class` attribute with the value "expensive" to the `<li>` element. This will apply the yellow background color defined in the `<style>` tag.

Now, books with a price greater than $10 will be highlighted in yellow.

You can also use `<xsl:choose>` for more complex conditional scenarios:

```plaintext
<xsl:choose>
  <xsl:when test="price > 15">
    <p>Very Expensive!</p>
  </xsl:when>
  <xsl:when test="price > 10">
    <p>Expensive</p>
  </xsl:when>
  <xsl:otherwise>
    <p>Affordable</p>
  </xsl:otherwise>
</xsl:choose>
```

This example shows how you can have multiple conditions and different outputs based on the price range.

## Using `<xsl:apply-templates>` for Reusability

`<xsl:apply-templates>` allows you to break down your stylesheet into smaller, more manageable templates. This promotes reusability and makes your code easier to understand and maintain.

**XML Document (books.xml - same as before):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<books>
  <book>
    <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
    <author>Douglas Adams</author>
    <price>10.99</price>
  </book>
  <book>
    <title>The Lord of the Rings</title>
    <author>J.R.R. Tolkien</author>
    <price>12.50</price>
  </book>
  <book>
    <title>Pride and Prejudice</title>
    <author>Jane Austen</author>
    <price>8.75</price>
  </book>
</books>
```

**XSLT Stylesheet (books_apply_templates.xsl):**

```plaintext
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Book List</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Book List</h1>
        <ul>
          <xsl:apply-templates select="books/book"/>
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="book">
    <li>
      <h2><xsl:value-of select="title"/></h2>
      <p>Author: <xsl:value-of select="author"/></p>
      <p>Price: $<xsl:value-of select="price"/></p>
    </li>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

**Explanation:**

- `<xsl:apply-templates select="books/book"/>`: This line selects all `book` elements under the `books` element and applies templates to them.
- `<xsl:template match="book">`: This template is applied to each `book` element that is selected by `<xsl:apply-templates>`.

This stylesheet achieves the same result as the `<xsl:for-each>` example, but it's organized differently. The main template now focuses on the overall structure of the HTML page, while the `book` template handles the formatting of individual book entries. This separation of concerns makes the stylesheet more modular and easier to maintain. If you needed to format the book information differently on another page, you could simply reuse the `book` template.

## XPath: Navigating the XML Structure

XPath (XML Path Language) is crucial for selecting nodes within your XML document. Here's a quick overview of common XPath expressions:

- `/`: Selects the root node.
- `book`: Selects all `book` elements that are children of the current node.
- `books/book`: Selects all `book` elements that are children of the `books` element.
- `//book`: Selects all `book` elements in the document, regardless of their location. (Be careful, this can be inefficient for large documents).
- `@attributeName`: Selects the value of the attribute `attributeName` of the current node.
- `book[@id='123']`: Selects all `book` elements that have an `id` attribute with the value '123'.
- `book[position()=1]`: Selects the first `book` element.
- `book[last()]`: Selects the last `book` element.
- `book[price > 10]`: Selects all `book` elements where the `price` is greater than 10.
- `text()`: Selects the text node of the current element.
- `contains(string(), substring)`: Checks if a string contains a substring. Example: `book[contains(title, 'Guide')]`

Learning XPath is essential for mastering XSLT. Numerous online resources provide in-depth XPath tutorials and references.

## XSLT Functions

XSLT provides a variety of built-in functions for manipulating data, including:

- **String Functions:** `string()`, `concat()`, `substring()`, `string-length()`, `translate()`, `normalize-space()`, `contains()`, `starts-with()`, `ends-with()`.
- **Numeric Functions:** `number()`, `sum()`, `round()`, `floor()`, `ceiling()`, `abs()`.
- **Date and Time Functions:** (More advanced, and often implementation-dependent) Functions to format dates and times.
- **Boolean Functions:** `true()`, `false()`, `not()`.

Example using `substring()`:

```plaintext
<xsl:value-of select="substring(title, 1, 10)"/>
```

This will extract the first 10 characters of the book title.

## Best Practices for XSLT Development

- **Modularize Your Stylesheets:** Break down complex transformations into smaller, reusable templates.
- **Use Meaningful Variable Names:** When using `<xsl:variable>`, choose descriptive names for clarity.
- **Comment Your Code:** Explain complex XPath expressions and transformation logic.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your stylesheets with various XML inputs to ensure they handle different scenarios correctly.
- **Optimize for Performance:** Avoid using `//` excessively, as it can be inefficient. Use more specific XPath expressions when possible. Consider XSLT profilers for identifying performance bottlenecks in complex stylesheets.
- **Understand XSLT Versions:** Be aware of the differences between XSLT 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. While 1.0 is widely supported, newer versions offer more powerful features, such as regular expression support and enhanced data type handling. However, newer versions might not be supported everywhere.

## Conclusion

XSLT is a valuable tool for transforming XML data. This guide has provided a foundation for understanding the core concepts and syntax of XSLT. By combining XSLT with XPath, you can effectively manipulate and transform XML documents to meet your specific needs. Experiment with the examples, explore the various XSLT elements and functions, and practice building your own stylesheets to become proficient in XSLT. This skill is especially valuable in web development, data integration, and other areas where XML data is prevalent.
