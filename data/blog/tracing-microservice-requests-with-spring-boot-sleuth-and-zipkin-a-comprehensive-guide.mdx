# Tracing Microservice Requests with Spring Boot, Sleuth, and Zipkin: A Comprehensive Guide

In the world of microservices, understanding the flow of a request across multiple services can be a daunting task.  When things go wrong, pinpointing the source of the problem can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.  This is where distributed tracing comes to the rescue. This blog post will guide you through setting up distributed tracing in your Spring Boot microservices using **Spring Cloud Sleuth** and **Zipkin**.  We'll cover everything from initial configuration to practical code examples, empowering you to effectively monitor and debug your microservice architecture.

## Why Distributed Tracing is Crucial for Microservices

Microservices offer numerous benefits, including independent deployment, scalability, and technology diversity. However, these advantages come with increased complexity. A single user request might traverse several services, making it difficult to:

*   **Identify bottlenecks:**  Slowdowns in one service can impact the entire request chain.
*   **Debug errors:**  Tracing a request across services is essential for pinpointing the root cause of failures.
*   **Monitor performance:**  Understanding the latency of each service helps optimize performance.
*   **Improve observability:** Gain insights into how services interact and depend on each other.

Distributed tracing tools like Sleuth and Zipkin provide the necessary visibility to tackle these challenges.

## What are Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin?

*   **Spring Cloud Sleuth:** Sleuth acts as a Spring Boot starter that automatically instruments your application with tracing capabilities. It adds unique identifiers to requests (trace ID and span ID) and propagates them across service boundaries. Think of it as the instrumentation layer that prepares the data.

*   **Zipkin:** Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that collects, stores, and visualizes tracing data. It provides a user interface for querying and analyzing traces, allowing you to understand the flow of requests and identify performance bottlenecks. Think of it as the collection and visualization layer.

## Setting up Zipkin

First, we need to set up Zipkin.  The easiest way to do this is using Docker.

```bash
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

This command pulls the official Zipkin Docker image and runs it in detached mode, exposing the Zipkin UI on port 9411.  You can now access the Zipkin UI at `http://localhost:9411`.

For production environments, consider configuring Zipkin with persistent storage (e.g., Cassandra, Elasticsearch, MySQL) for storing trace data. Refer to the Zipkin documentation for detailed instructions on setting up persistent storage.

## Setting up Spring Boot Microservices with Sleuth

Now, let's create two simple Spring Boot microservices, `service-a` and `service-b`, and integrate them with Sleuth and Zipkin.

### Step 1: Create a New Spring Boot Project

Use Spring Initializr ([https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/)) to create two new Spring Boot projects with the following dependencies:

*   **Spring Web:**  For building RESTful APIs.
*   **Spring Cloud Sleuth:** For distributed tracing.
*   **Spring Cloud Starter OpenTelemetry:** For observability
*   **Spring Cloud Starter Zipkin:** (or `spring-cloud-starter-brave` if using Brave instead of Zipkin) - This sends traces to Zipkin.
*   **Lombok (Optional):** For reducing boilerplate code.
*   **Spring Boot Actuator:** For exposing application health and metrics endpoints.

Name the projects `service-a` and `service-b`.

### Step 2: Configure `service-a`

Add the following code to your `service-a` application.

**`ServiceAApplication.java`**

```java
package com.example.servicea;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ServiceAApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ServiceAApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}
```

**`ServiceAController.java`**

```java
package com.example.servicea;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RestController
public class ServiceAController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ServiceAController.class);

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Value("${service-b.url}")
    private String serviceBUrl;

    @GetMapping("/service-a")
    public String serviceA() {
        logger.info("Service A endpoint called");
        String response = restTemplate.getForObject(serviceBUrl + "/service-b", String.class);
        return "Service A -> " + response;
    }
}
```

**`application.properties` (or `application.yml`)**

```properties
spring.application.name=service-a
spring.zipkin.baseUrl=http://localhost:9411
service-b.url=http://localhost:8082
server.port=8081
```

**Explanation:**

*   `spring.application.name`: Sets the application name for Sleuth to identify the service in Zipkin.
*   `spring.zipkin.baseUrl`:  Specifies the URL of your Zipkin server.
*   `service-b.url`: Defines the URL for `service-b`, which `service-a` will call.
*   `server.port`: Sets the port for `service-a` to run on.

### Step 3: Configure `service-b`

Add the following code to your `service-b` application.

**`ServiceBApplication.java`**

```java
package com.example.serviceb;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ServiceBApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ServiceBApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

**`ServiceBController.java`**

```java
package com.example.serviceb;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class ServiceBController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ServiceBController.class);

    @GetMapping("/service-b")
    public String serviceB() {
        logger.info("Service B endpoint called");
        return "Service B";
    }
}
```

**`application.properties` (or `application.yml`)**

```properties
spring.application.name=service-b
spring.zipkin.baseUrl=http://localhost:9411
server.port=8082
```

**Explanation:**

*   `spring.application.name`: Sets the application name for Sleuth to identify the service in Zipkin.
*   `spring.zipkin.baseUrl`:  Specifies the URL of your Zipkin server.
*   `server.port`: Sets the port for `service-b` to run on.

### Step 4: Run the Applications

Start both `service-a` and `service-b`.

### Step 5: Trigger a Request

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8081/service-a`. This will trigger a request to `service-a`, which will then call `service-b`.

### Step 6: View Traces in Zipkin

Open the Zipkin UI at `http://localhost:9411`. You should see traces related to your requests.  You can search by service name, trace ID, or other criteria.  Click on a trace to view a detailed timeline of the request as it flowed through `service-a` and `service-b`.  You'll see the individual spans representing the time spent in each service.

## Customizing Tracing

Sleuth and Zipkin offer several options for customizing tracing behavior.  Here are a few examples:

*   **Sampling:**  You can configure the sampling rate to reduce the amount of trace data collected.  This is useful for high-volume systems where collecting traces for every request would be too resource-intensive.

    ```properties
    spring.sleuth.sampler.probability=0.1  # Sample 10% of requests
    ```

*   **Custom Span Tags:**  You can add custom tags to spans to provide additional context.  This is useful for adding business-specific information to your traces.

    ```java
    import org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.Span;
    import org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.Tracer;
    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

    @RestController
    public class ServiceAController {

      @Autowired
      private Tracer tracer;

      @GetMapping("/custom-tag")
      public String customTag() {
        tracer.currentSpan().tag("my.custom.tag", "my.custom.value");
        return "Custom Tag Added";
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Asynchronous Operations:**  Sleuth automatically handles tracing for synchronous operations.  For asynchronous operations (e.g., using `CompletableFuture` or message queues), you may need to manually propagate the tracing context.  Sleuth provides utilities for this.

## Using OpenTelemetry (Alternative to Sleuth/Zipkin directly)

While Sleuth and Zipkin work well together, Spring Cloud also integrates with **OpenTelemetry**, an open-source observability framework.  OpenTelemetry offers a vendor-neutral API for tracing, metrics, and logging.  It also provides auto-instrumentation capabilities.

To use OpenTelemetry:

1.  **Remove the `spring-cloud-starter-zipkin` dependency.**
2.  **Add the `spring-cloud-starter-opentelemetry` dependency.**  This dependency provides the necessary auto-instrumentation for Spring Boot applications.
3.  **Configure OpenTelemetry to export data to Zipkin.**  This can be done using the `otel.exporter.zipkin.endpoint` property in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

    ```properties
    otel.exporter.zipkin.endpoint=http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans
    ```

With OpenTelemetry configured, your Spring Boot applications will automatically generate and export tracing data to Zipkin, providing the same distributed tracing capabilities.  OpenTelemetry provides a more standardized and flexible approach to observability compared to using Sleuth directly with Zipkin.

## Best Practices for Distributed Tracing

*   **Consistent Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for services, endpoints, and span tags. This makes it easier to search and analyze traces.
*   **Context Propagation:** Ensure that tracing context (trace ID and span ID) is properly propagated across service boundaries, especially for asynchronous operations.
*   **Logging:** Include trace IDs and span IDs in your application logs. This makes it easier to correlate logs with traces.  Use a logging framework like Logback or Log4j with a suitable pattern layout that includes the `%mdc{traceId}` and `%mdc{spanId}`.
*   **Security:** Secure your Zipkin server and restrict access to sensitive trace data.
*   **Sampling Strategy:** Carefully choose your sampling strategy to balance the need for detailed trace data with the performance impact of collecting traces.
*   **Correlation IDs:** In addition to trace IDs, consider using correlation IDs for end-to-end tracking of requests across systems that are not directly instrumented with tracing.  The correlation ID can be passed as a header or through messaging systems.
