# JavaScript Promise.allSettled(): Comprehensive Guide with Examples

In modern JavaScript development, asynchronous operations are ubiquitous. We often need to execute multiple promises concurrently, but handling the success or failure of each promise individually can be cumbersome.  That's where `Promise.allSettled()` comes in handy.  This powerful method allows you to execute an array of promises and get the result of *every* promise, regardless of whether they resolve or reject. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide to `Promise.allSettled()`, including syntax, use cases, and practical code examples.

## What is Promise.allSettled()?

`Promise.allSettled()` is a JavaScript promise method that takes an array of promises as input and returns a single promise that resolves when *all* of the input promises have either resolved or rejected.  Importantly, it does not reject if any of the input promises reject. Instead, the returned promise always resolves with an array of objects, each representing the outcome of a corresponding input promise.

Each object in the resulting array has the following structure:

*   `status`: A string, either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`.
*   `value`: If `status` is `"fulfilled"`, this property holds the resolved value of the promise.
*   `reason`: If `status` is `"rejected"`, this property holds the rejection reason of the promise.

## Syntax

The syntax of `Promise.allSettled()` is straightforward:

```javascript
Promise.allSettled(iterable);
```

Where `iterable` is an iterable object (e.g., an array) of promises.

## Why use Promise.allSettled()?

`Promise.allSettled()` is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to know the outcome of all promises, even if some of them fail. This contrasts with `Promise.all()`, which rejects immediately if any of the input promises reject, potentially leaving you unaware of the status of other promises. Here are some common use cases:

*   **Performing parallel operations with independent results:**  Imagine fetching data from multiple APIs. You might want to process the data from the successful API calls even if some API calls fail.
*   **Logging errors and retrying failed operations:**  You can use `Promise.allSettled()` to log errors from rejected promises and potentially retry those operations.
*   **User interface updates:**  Displaying a status message for each asynchronous operation, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails.

## Code Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to illustrate how `Promise.allSettled()` works.

### Example 1: Simple Success and Failure

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const promise2 = Promise.reject("Error: Promise 2 rejected");
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 100));

Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((results) => {
    console.log(results);
    // Output:
    // [
    //   { status: 'fulfilled', value: 1 },
    //   { status: 'rejected', reason: 'Error: Promise 2 rejected' },
    //   { status: 'fulfilled', value: 3 }
    // ]
  });
```

In this example, `promise1` resolves immediately, `promise2` rejects immediately, and `promise3` resolves after a short delay.  `Promise.allSettled()` waits for all three promises to settle and then resolves with an array of objects containing the status, value (if fulfilled), or reason (if rejected) for each promise.

### Example 2: Handling API Calls

```javascript
async function fetchData(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    throw error; // Re-throw for Promise.allSettled to catch
  }
}

const urls = [
  "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1", // Success
  "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2", // Success
  "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/invalid", // Failure
];

Promise.allSettled(urls.map(url => fetchData(url)))
  .then((results) => {
    results.forEach((result, index) => {
      if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
        console.log(`API ${index + 1}: Success! Data:`, result.value);
      } else {
        console.error(`API ${index + 1}: Failure! Reason:`, result.reason);
      }
    });
  });
```

This example demonstrates fetching data from multiple URLs. Even if one URL is invalid and the fetch request fails, `Promise.allSettled()` still provides the results for the successful fetches.  We can then iterate through the results and handle each API call individually.

### Example 3: Combining with `async/await`

```javascript
async function processPromises(promises) {
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises);

  for (const result of results) {
    if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
      console.log('Promise fulfilled with value:', result.value);
    } else {
      console.error('Promise rejected with reason:', result.reason);
    }
  }
}

const promises = [
  Promise.resolve("Task 1 completed"),
  Promise.reject("Task 2 failed"),
  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Task 3 completed after delay"), 500))
];

processPromises(promises);
```

This example shows how to use `Promise.allSettled()` with the `async/await` syntax for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.  The `processPromises` function encapsulates the logic for handling the results of the promises.

### Example 4: Retrying Failed Promises

This example shows a more advanced use case, retrying rejected promises:

```javascript
async function retryPromise(promiseFn, maxRetries = 3) {
  let attempts = 0;

  while (attempts < maxRetries) {
    try {
      return await promiseFn();
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn(`Attempt ${attempts + 1} failed: ${error}`);
      attempts++;
      // Optionally add a delay before retrying
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Wait 1 second
    }
  }

  throw new Error(`Promise failed after ${maxRetries} attempts`);
}


const promise1 = () => Promise.resolve("Task 1 completed");
const promise2 = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    resolve("Task 2 initially failed but eventually succeeded");
  } else {
    reject("Task 2 failed");
  }
}); // Simulate an occasionally failing promise
const promise3 = () => Promise.reject("Task 3 permanently failed");

const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];

async function runPromisesWithRetry() {
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(promises.map(promiseFn => retryPromise(promiseFn)));

  results.forEach((result, index) => {
    if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
      console.log(`Promise ${index + 1} (with retry): Fulfilled with value:`, result.value);
    } else {
      console.error(`Promise ${index + 1} (with retry): Rejected with reason:`, result.reason);
    }
  });
}

runPromisesWithRetry();

```

This example demonstrates how to use `Promise.allSettled` in conjunction with a retry mechanism. The `retryPromise` function attempts to execute a given promise function up to a maximum number of times. `Promise.allSettled` ensures that all promises are either fulfilled or rejected, even if retries are involved.

## Promise.allSettled() vs. Promise.all() vs. Promise.race() vs. Promise.any()

It's helpful to compare `Promise.allSettled()` with other similar promise methods:

*   **`Promise.all()`:** Rejects immediately if any of the input promises reject. Resolves with an array of the resolved values when all promises resolve. This is suitable when all promises must succeed for the overall operation to be considered successful.

*   **`Promise.race()`:** Resolves or rejects as soon as the first promise in the iterable settles (either resolves or rejects). Useful when you only need the result of the fastest promise.

*   **`Promise.any()`:** Resolves with the value of the first promise that fulfills. It rejects if all promises reject, with an AggregateError containing the rejection reasons. This method is useful when you need at least one promise to succeed, but don't care which one.  Note: `Promise.any()` may not be supported in older browsers, polyfills may be needed.

The key difference is that `Promise.allSettled()` always resolves, giving you the status of *every* promise, whereas the others may reject or only provide the result of one promise.

## Best Practices

*   **Error Handling:** Always check the `status` property to determine whether a promise was fulfilled or rejected.  Access the `value` or `reason` property accordingly.
*   **Clarity:** Use descriptive variable names and comments to clearly indicate the purpose of each promise and how you're handling its result.
*   **Avoid Nested Promises:**  Minimize nesting promises for better readability and maintainability. Use `async/await` where appropriate.
*   **Consider Performance:** While `Promise.allSettled()` offers robust error handling, be mindful of the performance impact when dealing with a large number of promises.  Evaluate whether alternatives like `Promise.race()` or processing promises in batches might be more efficient for your specific use case.
*   **Polyfilling:** If targeting older browsers, you might need to include a polyfill for `Promise.allSettled()` as it was introduced in ES2020.

## Conclusion

`Promise.allSettled()` is a valuable tool for handling multiple asynchronous operations in JavaScript, especially when you need to know the outcome of all promises, regardless of their individual success or failure. By understanding its syntax, use cases, and best practices, you can write more robust and reliable asynchronous code. Remember to choose the right promise method based on your specific requirements, considering factors like error handling, performance, and the desired outcome of the overall operation.  Happy coding!
