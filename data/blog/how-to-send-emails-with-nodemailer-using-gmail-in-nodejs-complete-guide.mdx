# How to Send Emails with Nodemailer using Gmail in Node.js (Complete Guide)

Sending emails programmatically is a common requirement for many Node.js applications. Whether you need to send welcome emails, password reset links, notifications, or marketing materials, Nodemailer provides a simple and efficient solution. This guide will walk you through setting up Nodemailer to send emails using your Gmail account.

## What is Nodemailer?

Nodemailer is a module for Node.js applications that allows you to easily send emails from your server. It supports various transport methods, including SMTP, which we'll use with Gmail in this tutorial. Nodemailer simplifies the process of creating and sending emails by handling the complexities of email protocols.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** You'll need Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn:** npm is usually included with Node.js. Yarn is an alternative package manager. You can choose either.

## Step 1: Set up Gmail for Nodemailer

Gmail requires you to configure some settings before you can use it with Nodemailer. Google has strict security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your account. We'll cover two methods: using "Less secure app access" (not recommended for production) and using "App Passwords" (recommended).

**Method 1: Using "Less secure app access" (Not Recommended - Deprecated by Google)**

**Important:** This method is **deprecated** and no longer supported by Google for new Gmail accounts or for accounts where 2-Step Verification is enabled. Using it poses a security risk. We only include it here for historical context and to explain why you might encounter this option in older tutorials. **Do NOT use this method for production applications.**

1.  **Enable "Less secure app access":**

    - Go to your Google Account settings: [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/)
    - Click on "Security" in the left-hand menu.
    - Scroll down to the "Less secure app access" section.
    - Turn "Allow less secure apps" **ON**.

    **Warning:** Enabling this option weakens your account security. Consider using App Passwords instead.

**Method 2: Using App Passwords (Recommended)**

This is the recommended and more secure way to use Gmail with Nodemailer. It allows you to create a specific password just for your application, without exposing your main Gmail password.

1.  **Enable 2-Step Verification:**

    - Go to your Google Account settings: [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/)
    - Click on "Security" in the left-hand menu.
    - Under "How you sign in to Google," click on "2-Step Verification."
    - Follow the instructions to enable 2-Step Verification. You'll need to provide a phone number for verification.

2.  **Create an App Password:**

    - Go back to the "Security" section in your Google Account settings.
    - Under "How you sign in to Google," click on "App passwords."
    - Select "Mail" from the "Select app" dropdown.
    - Select "Other (Custom name)" from the "Select device" dropdown.
    - Enter a name for your app (e.g., "Nodemailer App").
    - Click "Generate."

    Google will generate a 16-character app password. **Copy this password and store it securely.** You will need it in the next step. This password is only shown once, so if you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.

## Step 2: Install Nodemailer

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then, install Nodemailer using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install nodemailer
```

or

```plaintext
yarn add nodemailer
```

## Step 3: Create a Nodemailer Transporter

A transporter is an object that Nodemailer uses to send emails. It specifies the transport method (SMTP in our case) and the authentication details for your Gmail account. Create a new file, for example, `mailer.js`, and add the following code:

```javascript
// mailer.js
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: 'your_email@gmail.com', // Replace with your Gmail address
    pass: 'your_app_password', // Replace with your App Password or less secure app password if you used that method (NOT RECOMMENDED)
  },
})

module.exports = transporter
```

**Important:** Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address and `your_app_password` with the App Password you generated in Step 1 (recommended) OR your Gmail password if you are using the deprecated "Less secure app access" method (NOT RECOMMENDED).

## Step 4: Send an Email

Now that you have a transporter, you can use it to send emails. Create another file, for example, `send-email.js`, and add the following code:

```javascript
// send-email.js
const transporter = require('./mailer')

const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@gmail.com', // Replace with your Gmail address
  to: 'recipient_email@example.com', // Replace with the recipient's email address
  subject: 'Hello from Nodemailer!',
  text: 'This is a test email sent using Nodemailer with Gmail.',
  html: '<p>This is a <b>test email</b> sent using Nodemailer with Gmail.</p>', // Optional HTML content
}

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log('Error sending email:', error)
  } else {
    console.log('Email sent:', info.response)
  }
})
```

**Explanation:**

- `from`: The sender's email address (your Gmail address).
- `to`: The recipient's email address.
- `subject`: The subject of the email.
- `text`: The plain text content of the email.
- `html`: The HTML content of the email (optional). If both `text` and `html` are provided, email clients will typically display the HTML version.

Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address and `recipient_email@example.com` with the email address you want to send the email to.

## Step 5: Run the Code

In your terminal, run the `send-email.js` file:

```plaintext
node send-email.js
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should see a message in the console indicating that the email was sent successfully. Check the recipient's inbox to confirm that the email arrived.

## Adding Attachments

You can also add attachments to your emails. Modify the `mailOptions` object in `send-email.js` to include an `attachments` array:

```javascript
const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@gmail.com',
  to: 'recipient_email@example.com',
  subject: 'Email with Attachment',
  text: 'This email has an attachment.',
  attachments: [
    {
      filename: 'example.txt',
      content: 'This is the content of the attachment.',
    },
    {
      filename: 'image.png',
      path: '/path/to/your/image.png', // Path to your attachment file
    },
  ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `filename`: The name of the attachment as it will appear in the email.
- `content`: The content of the attachment (for text-based files). You can provide a string or a Buffer.
- `path`: The path to the attachment file on your file system.

## Handling Errors

It's crucial to handle errors gracefully when sending emails. The `sendMail` function returns an error object if something goes wrong. You should check for this error and log it or take other appropriate actions. The example code above already includes basic error handling.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

- **"Username and Password not accepted" error:**

  - **Check your email address and password:** Make sure you've entered them correctly.
  - **App Password:** If you're using App Passwords, ensure you've generated one and are using the correct password.
  - **"Less secure app access":** If you are _trying_ to use the deprecated "Less secure app access" method, ensure that you have enabled it in your Google Account settings _and_ that your account does _not_ have 2-Step Verification enabled. However, as noted before, using "Less secure app access" is strongly discouraged.
  - **2-Step Verification:** If you have 2-Step Verification enabled, you **must** use App Passwords.

- **Email marked as spam:**

  - **Improve your email content:** Avoid using spam trigger words in your subject line or body.
  - **Set up SPF and DKIM records:** These records help authenticate your email server and prevent it from being marked as spam. Consult your domain registrar's documentation for instructions.
  - **Use a dedicated IP address:** If you're sending a large volume of emails, consider using a dedicated IP address to improve deliverability.

- **"Too many login attempts" error:**
  - **Rate limiting:** Gmail imposes limits on the number of emails you can send within a given time period. Avoid sending too many emails in a short period. Implement a delay between sending emails.

Nodemailer offers many advanced options for customizing your emails. You can:

- Set custom headers.
- Use alternative transports (e.g., Sendmail, Amazon SES).
- Embed images in your HTML content.
