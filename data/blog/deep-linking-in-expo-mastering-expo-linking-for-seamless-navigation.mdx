# Deep Linking in Expo: Mastering Expo Linking for Seamless Navigation

Deep linking is a powerful technique that allows users to navigate directly to specific content within your mobile application from external sources like URLs, email links, or push notifications. In the Expo ecosystem, `expo-linking` simplifies the implementation of deep linking, providing a robust and easy-to-use API. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on how to leverage `expo-linking` to enhance your Expo React Native apps.

## What is Deep Linking?

Deep linking bridges the gap between the web and mobile applications.  Instead of just opening your app, a deep link directs users to a specific screen or section within your app, creating a more seamless and efficient user experience. Imagine clicking a link in an email that takes you directly to a specific product page within an e-commerce app, rather than just opening the app's home screen. That's the power of deep linking.

## Why Use Deep Linking in Expo?

*   **Improved User Experience:**  Direct users to the content they need quickly and efficiently.
*   **Increased Engagement:**  Drive more traffic to specific parts of your application.
*   **Better Marketing Campaigns:**  Track and optimize your marketing efforts by using unique deep links for different campaigns.
*   **Seamless Integrations:**  Integrate your app with other applications and services more effectively.

## Getting Started with `expo-linking`

First, install the `expo-linking` package:

```bash
npx expo install expo-linking
```

This command adds `expo-linking` to your project's dependencies.

## Understanding URL Schemes and Universal Links

There are two primary types of deep linking:

*   **URL Schemes:** Custom URL schemes are unique prefixes that you define for your app (e.g., `myapp://`). When a user clicks a URL with your app's scheme, the operating system launches your app and passes the URL to it.  **Note:** URL schemes are less secure and can be intercepted by other apps claiming the same scheme.

*   **Universal Links (Android App Links):**  Universal Links are standard HTTP/HTTPS URLs that directly open your app if it's installed.  They are verified by associating your app with a website you own, making them more secure and reliable than URL schemes.

## Implementing URL Schemes with `expo-linking`

1.  **Configure `app.json` (or `app.config.js`)**:  Define your app's URL scheme in the `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "MyApp",
        "slug": "my-app",
        "scheme": "myapp",
        "ios": {
          "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp"
        },
        "android": {
          "package": "com.example.myapp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Here, `"scheme": "myapp"` defines the URL scheme `myapp://`.  Make sure `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` match your application identifiers.

2.  **Handle the Incoming URL:**  Use `Linking.getInitialURL()` to retrieve the URL that launched the app and `Linking.addEventListener()` to listen for incoming URLs while the app is running.

    ```javascript
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
    import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

    export default function App() {
      const [initialUrl, setInitialUrl] = useState(null);
      const [currentUrl, setCurrentUrl] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        async function getInitialUrl() {
          const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
          setInitialUrl(url);
        }

        getInitialUrl();

        const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
          setCurrentUrl(event.url);
        });

        return () => subscription.remove(); // Clean up the event listener
      }, []);

      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
          <Text>Initial URL: {initialUrl || 'No initial URL'}</Text>
          <Text>Current URL: {currentUrl || 'No current URL'}</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

    This code retrieves the initial URL when the app starts and listens for incoming URLs while the app is running. The `useEffect` hook ensures that this code runs only once when the component mounts and cleans up the event listener when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

3.  **Parse the URL:**  Use a library like `expo-linking` or the built-in `URL` constructor to parse the URL and extract the relevant parameters.

    ```javascript
    import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

    // Example URL: myapp://products/123?utm_source=email
    const url = 'myapp://products/123?utm_source=email';
    const parsedUrl = Linking.parse(url);

    console.log(parsedUrl.hostname);   // Output: products
    console.log(parsedUrl.path);       // Output: /123
    console.log(parsedUrl.queryParams); // Output: { utm_source: 'email' }
    ```

    `Linking.parse()` breaks down the URL into its components, making it easier to access the path and query parameters.

4.  **Navigate Based on the URL:**  Use a navigation library like React Navigation to navigate to the appropriate screen based on the parsed URL.

    ```javascript
    import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
    import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

    function handleDeepLink(url, navigation) {
      const parsedUrl = Linking.parse(url);
      const { hostname, path, queryParams } = parsedUrl;

      if (hostname === 'products' && path) {
        const productId = path.substring(1); // Remove the leading '/'
        navigation.navigate('ProductDetails', { productId });
      } else {
        // Handle other routes or show an error message
        navigation.navigate('Home');
      }
    }

    export default function App() {
        const navigation = useNavigation();
        const [url, setUrl] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
          async function getInitialUrl() {
            const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
            if(url) {
              handleDeepLink(url, navigation);
            }
          }

          getInitialUrl();

          const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
            handleDeepLink(event.url, navigation);
          });

          return () => subscription.remove();
        }, [navigation]);

        return (
          <View>
             <Text>Navigating...</Text>
          </View>
        );
    }
    ```

    In this example, if the hostname is `products` and a path is present, the code extracts the product ID from the path and navigates to the `ProductDetails` screen, passing the product ID as a parameter. You'll need to integrate this code with your React Navigation setup. Remember to wrap your component in a `NavigationContainer` from `@react-navigation/native`.

## Implementing Universal Links with `expo-linking`

Universal Links offer a more secure and seamless deep linking experience.

1.  **Associate Your App with Your Website:**  This is the most crucial step. You need to create an `apple-app-site-association` file for iOS and an `assetlinks.json` file for Android, and place them in the `.well-known` directory of your website.

    *   **iOS (`apple-app-site-association`):**  Place this file at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`.  It should be a JSON file without the `.json` extension.

        ```json
        {
          "applinks": {
            "apps": [],
            "details": [
              {
                "appID": "TEAMID.com.example.myapp", // Replace with your Team ID and Bundle Identifier
                "paths": [ "*" ] // Allows all paths; be more specific for security
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        Replace `TEAMID` with your Apple Developer Team ID. You can find this ID in your Apple Developer account.  `com.example.myapp` is your Bundle Identifier.

    *   **Android (`assetlinks.json`):**  Place this file at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`.

        ```json
        [{
          "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
          "target": {
            "namespace": "android_app",
            "package_name": "com.example.myapp", // Replace with your Package Name
            "sha256_cert_fingerprints":
            ["YOUR_SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINT"] // Replace with your SHA256 certificate fingerprint
          }
        }]
        ```

        Replace `com.example.myapp` with your Android package name.  You need to generate the SHA256 certificate fingerprint of your signing certificate.  Use the `keytool` command to get the fingerprint.

        ```bash
        keytool -list -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-alias
        ```

        Then, copy the SHA256 fingerprint from the output.

2.  **Configure `app.json` (or `app.config.js`)**:  Specify the associated domains in your `app.json` file.

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "MyApp",
        "slug": "my-app",
        "ios": {
          "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myapp",
          "associatedDomains": [
            "applinks:yourdomain.com" // Important: Use applinks: prefix
          ]
        },
        "android": {
          "package": "com.example.myapp",
          "intentFilters": [
            {
              "action": "android.intent.action.VIEW",
              "data": [
                {
                  "scheme": "https",
                  "host": "yourdomain.com",
                  "pathPrefix": "/"
                }
              ],
              "category": [
                "android.intent.category.DEFAULT",
                "android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    *   For iOS, use the `associatedDomains` array with the `applinks:` prefix.
    *   For Android, configure the `intentFilters` to handle `https` URLs with your domain.  The `pathPrefix` attribute specifies which paths on your website should trigger your app. `/` indicates that all paths will trigger your app.  Be more specific for security.

3.  **Handle the Incoming URL:**  The code for handling the incoming URL remains similar to the URL scheme implementation.  The key difference is that you'll be dealing with `https` URLs instead of custom schemes.

    ```javascript
    import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
    import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

    function handleDeepLink(url, navigation) {
      const parsedUrl = Linking.parse(url);
      const { hostname, pathname, queryParams } = parsedUrl;

      if (hostname === 'yourdomain.com' && pathname.startsWith('/products/')) {
        const productId = pathname.split('/')[2]; // Extract product ID from path
        navigation.navigate('ProductDetails', { productId });
      } else {
        // Handle other routes or show an error message
        navigation.navigate('Home');
      }
    }

    export default function App() {
        const navigation = useNavigation();
        const [url, setUrl] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
          async function getInitialUrl() {
            const url = await Linking.getInitialURL();
            if(url) {
              handleDeepLink(url, navigation);
            }
          }

          getInitialUrl();

          const subscription = Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
            handleDeepLink(event.url, navigation);
          });

          return () => subscription.remove();
        }, [navigation]);

        return (
          <View>
             <Text>Navigating...</Text>
          </View>
        );
    }
    ```

    This code checks if the hostname is `yourdomain.com` and the pathname starts with `/products/`.  If so, it extracts the product ID and navigates to the `ProductDetails` screen.

## Testing Deep Linking

*   **Expo Go:** Deep linking might not function exactly as expected in Expo Go, especially with universal links.  It's best to test with a standalone build.

*   **Standalone Builds:**  Create standalone builds for iOS and Android to test deep linking thoroughly.

*   **Android ADB:** Use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to simulate deep links on Android emulators or devices.

    ```bash
    adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "myapp://products/123" com.example.myapp
    ```

    Replace `myapp://products/123` with your deep link and `com.example.myapp` with your package name.

*   **iOS `xcrun`:**  Use `xcrun` to simulate deep links on iOS simulators.

    ```bash
    xcrun simctl openurl booted "myapp://products/123"
    ```

    Replace `myapp://products/123` with your deep link.

## Best Practices for Deep Linking

*   **Handle Edge Cases:**  Gracefully handle cases where the app is not installed or the URL is invalid.  Provide a fallback experience, such as redirecting the user to your website or displaying an error message.

*   **Secure Your Deep Links:**  Validate incoming URLs and parameters to prevent malicious attacks.  Consider using signed deep links to ensure that the links are genuine.

*   **Use a Navigation Library:**  Integrate deep linking with a robust navigation library like React Navigation to manage your app's navigation stack effectively.

*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your deep linking implementation on different devices, operating systems, and app versions to ensure it works correctly.

*   **Consider Branch.io or AppsFlyer:** For advanced deep linking features like attribution tracking, deferred deep linking (install tracking and routing), and analytics, consider using a third-party service like Branch.io or AppsFlyer.  These services provide comprehensive solutions for deep linking and mobile attribution.
