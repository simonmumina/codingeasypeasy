# JavaScript Statements: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

JavaScript statements are the instructions that the JavaScript interpreter executes to perform actions. They are the building blocks of any JavaScript program. Understanding JavaScript statements is crucial for writing effective and efficient code. This guide will provide a detailed explanation of various JavaScript statements, accompanied by practical examples.

## What are JavaScript Statements?

In simple terms, a JavaScript statement is a line of code that tells the browser what to do. A JavaScript program is essentially a sequence of these statements, executed one after the other, unless control flow statements (like `if`, `for`, `while`) dictate otherwise.

JavaScript statements can perform various actions, such as:

- Declaring variables
- Assigning values to variables
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Calling functions
- Controlling the flow of execution

## Types of JavaScript Statements

JavaScript offers a wide variety of statements, which can be broadly classified into the following categories:

- **Declaration Statements:** Used to declare variables and functions.
- **Expression Statements:** Expressions that have a side effect (e.g., assignments, function calls).
- **Control Flow Statements:** Used to control the order in which statements are executed (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do...while`).

Let's explore each of these categories in detail.

### 1. Declaration Statements

Declaration statements introduce new variables and functions into your program.

#### `var`, `let`, and `const`

These keywords are used to declare variables. The key difference lies in their scope and mutability.

- **`var`**: Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value. `var` declarations are function-scoped or globally scoped. `var` allows redeclaration and re-assignment. Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript development.

  ```plaintext
  var x = 10; // Declare a variable named x and assign it the value 10
  var x = 20; // Redeclare x - Allowed with var
  x = 30;     // Reassign x - Allowed with var
  console.log(x); // Output: 30
  ```

- **`let`**: Declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value. `let` allows re-assignment but **not** redeclaration within the same scope.

  ```plaintext
  let y = 5; // Declare a variable named y and assign it the value 5
  // let y = 10; // Error: Identifier 'y' has already been declared (redeclaration not allowed)
  y = 15;     // Reassign y - Allowed with let
  console.log(y); // Output: 15
  ```

- **`const`**: Declares a block-scoped read-only named constant. `const` requires initialization during declaration and **cannot** be re-assigned after that.

  ```plaintext
  const z = 25; // Declare a constant named z and assign it the value 25
  // z = 30;     // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
  console.log(z); // Output: 25

  // Note: const does not make the value immutable, only the variable binding.
  const myObject = { value: 1 };
  myObject.value = 2; // Allowed - We are changing a property of the object, not reassigning myObject itself.
  console.log(myObject); // Output: { value: 2 }
  ```

#### `function`

The `function` keyword is used to declare a function. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

```plaintext
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### 2. Expression Statements

An expression statement evaluates an expression. These expressions often involve operators and operands, and they can produce a value or have side effects.

- **Assignment Statements:** Assign a value to a variable.

  ```plaintext
  let a = 5;      // Assign the value 5 to the variable a
  a = a + 2;  // Assign the result of a + 2 (which is 7) back to a
  ```

- **Increment and Decrement Operators:** Increment or decrement the value of a variable.

  ```plaintext
  let count = 0;
  count++;     // Increment count by 1 (count is now 1)
  count--;     // Decrement count by 1 (count is now 0)
  ```

- **Function Calls:** Execute a function.

  ```plaintext
  console.log("This is a function call."); // Call the console.log function
  ```

- **`delete` operator:** Removes a property from an object.

  ```plaintext
  const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe"
  };

  delete person.lastName; // Remove the lastName property
  console.log(person);     // Output: { firstName: 'John' }
  ```

### 3. Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements allow you to control the order in which statements are executed in your JavaScript program.

#### `if`, `else if`, and `else` Statements

These statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

```plaintext
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else if (age >= 13) {
  console.log("You are a teenager.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a child.");
}
```

#### `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement allows you to select one of several code blocks to execute based on the value of an expression.

```plaintext
let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's Monday!");
    break;
  case "Tuesday":
    console.log("It's Tuesday!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's another day.");
}
```

**Important: Remember to include `break` statements at the end of each `case` block. Without `break`, the execution will "fall through" to the next case.**

#### `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

```plaintext
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

#### `while` Loop

The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```plaintext
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log("While loop iteration: " + i);
  i++;
}
```

#### `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once.

```plaintext
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log("Do...while loop iteration: " + i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

#### `for...in` Loop

The `for...in` loop iterates over the _enumerable properties_ of an object.

```plaintext
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
```

#### `for...of` Loop

The `for...of` loop iterates over the values of an _iterable object_ (e.g., arrays, strings, maps, sets).

```plaintext
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}
```

#### `break` Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or `switch` statement prematurely.

```plaintext
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
  }
  console.log(i);
}
```

#### `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.

```plaintext
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // Skip even numbers
  }
  console.log(i); // Only print odd numbers
}
```

#### `try...catch...finally` Statement

The `try...catch...finally` statement is used to handle exceptions (errors) that may occur during the execution of your code.

```plaintext
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
  let result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an error
  console.log(result); // This line will not be executed
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
  console.error("An error occurred: " + error.message);
} finally {
  // Code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an error occurred
  console.log("Finally block executed.");
}
```

### 4. Other Important Statements

- **`return` Statement:** Specifies the value to be returned from a function.

  ```plaintext
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  let sum = add(3, 5); // sum will be 8
  ```

- **`throw` Statement:** Throws an exception (error). This allows you to create custom error handling.

  ```plaintext
  function checkAge(age) {
    if (age < 0) {
      throw new Error("Age cannot be negative.");
    }
    console.log("Age is valid.");
  }

  try {
    checkAge(-5);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message); // Output: Age cannot be negative.
  }
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Use meaningful variable names:** Choose names that clearly indicate the purpose of the variable.
- **Indent your code properly:** Consistent indentation makes your code more readable.
- **Comment your code:** Explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of your code.
- **Avoid using `var`:** Prefer `let` and `const` for better scope control.
- **Use strict mode (`"use strict";`):** This helps you catch common coding errors.
