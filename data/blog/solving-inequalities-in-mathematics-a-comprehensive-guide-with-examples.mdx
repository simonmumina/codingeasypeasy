# Solving Inequalities in Mathematics: A Comprehensive Guide

Inequalities are fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly in algebra, calculus, and analysis. Unlike equations that assert the equality of two expressions, inequalities describe a relationship where one expression is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of solving inequalities, covering various types and techniques with detailed examples and explanations.

## Understanding the Basics

Before diving into solving inequalities, it's crucial to understand the symbols and concepts involved:

- **> (Greater Than):** Indicates that the left-hand side is larger than the right-hand side.
- **< (Less Than):** Indicates that the left-hand side is smaller than the right-hand side.
- **≥ (Greater Than or Equal To):** Indicates that the left-hand side is larger than or equal to the right-hand side.
- **≤ (Less Than or Equal To):** Indicates that the left-hand side is smaller than or equal to the right-hand side.

A **solution set** represents all values that satisfy the inequality. Solutions are often represented graphically on a number line.

## Solving Linear Inequalities

Linear inequalities involve variables raised to the power of one. The process of solving them is similar to solving linear equations, with one critical difference: **multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.**

**Example 1: Solve the inequality `3x + 5 > 14`**

1.  **Isolate the variable term:**
    Subtract 5 from both sides:
    `3x + 5 - 5 > 14 - 5`
    `3x > 9`

2.  **Solve for the variable:**
    Divide both sides by 3:
    `3x / 3 > 9 / 3`
    `x > 3`

The solution set is all values of _x_ greater than 3. In interval notation, this is (3, ∞).

**Number Line Representation:**

```
     <-----------------|----------------->
                      3
                      (Open Circle - Not Included)
```

**Example 2: Solve the inequality `-2x + 7 ≤ 1`**

1.  **Isolate the variable term:**
    Subtract 7 from both sides:
    `-2x + 7 - 7 ≤ 1 - 7`
    `-2x ≤ -6`

2.  **Solve for the variable (and reverse the inequality sign):**
    Divide both sides by -2 (and remember to flip the inequality sign!):
    `-2x / -2 ≥ -6 / -2`
    `x ≥ 3`

The solution set is all values of _x_ greater than or equal to 3. In interval notation, this is [3, ∞).

**Number Line Representation:**

```
     <-----------------|----------------->
                      3
                      [Closed Bracket - Included]
```

## Solving Quadratic Inequalities

Quadratic inequalities involve variables raised to the power of two. Solving them requires a slightly different approach.

**Steps to Solve Quadratic Inequalities:**

1.  **Rewrite the inequality in standard form:** `ax² + bx + c > 0` (`or <, ≥, ≤ 0`)

2.  **Find the roots (zeros) of the quadratic equation:** `ax² + bx + c = 0`. This can be done by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square.

3.  **Determine the intervals defined by the roots:** The roots divide the number line into intervals.

4.  **Test a value from each interval:** Substitute a test value from each interval into the original inequality. If the test value satisfies the inequality, then that entire interval is part of the solution.

5.  **Write the solution set:** Combine the intervals that satisfy the inequality.

**Example: Solve the inequality `x² - 3x - 4 < 0`**

1.  **Standard Form:** The inequality is already in standard form.

2.  **Find the Roots:**
    Factor the quadratic expression:
    `(x - 4)(x + 1) = 0`
    The roots are `x = 4` and `x = -1`.

3.  **Determine the Intervals:**
    The roots divide the number line into three intervals:

    - `(-∞, -1)`
    - `(-1, 4)`
    - `(4, ∞)`

4.  **Test Values:**

    - **Interval (-∞, -1):** Let `x = -2`. `(-2)² - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6`. Since 6 is not less than 0, this interval is **not** part of the solution.

    - **Interval (-1, 4):** Let `x = 0`. `(0)² - 3(0) - 4 = -4`. Since -4 is less than 0, this interval **is** part of the solution.

    - **Interval (4, ∞):** Let `x = 5`. `(5)² - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6`. Since 6 is not less than 0, this interval is **not** part of the solution.

5.  **Solution Set:**
    The solution set is the interval `(-1, 4)`.

**Number Line Representation:**

```
     <-----(-1)-----|--------(4)------->
                 (Open Circle)     (Open Circle)
```

**Code Example (Python) - Verifying Solutions:**

```plaintext
def check_quadratic_inequality(x):
  """Checks if a given value satisfies the inequality x² - 3x - 4 < 0."""
  return x**2 - 3*x - 4 < 0

# Test values
print(check_quadratic_inequality(-2))  # Output: False
print(check_quadratic_inequality(0))   # Output: True
print(check_quadratic_inequality(5))   # Output: False

# Checking a value within the solution interval
print(check_quadratic_inequality(2))   # Output: True
```

## Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

Absolute value inequalities involve expressions enclosed within absolute value symbols. Recall that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.

**Key Principles:**

- **|x| < a is equivalent to -a < x < a**
- **|x| > a is equivalent to x < -a or x > a**
- **|x| ≤ a is equivalent to -a ≤ x ≤ a**
- **|x| ≥ a is equivalent to x ≤ -a or x ≥ a**

**Example 1: Solve the inequality `|2x - 1| < 5`**

1.  **Apply the principle:**
    `-5 < 2x - 1 < 5`

2.  **Solve for x:**
    Add 1 to all parts of the inequality:
    `-5 + 1 < 2x - 1 + 1 < 5 + 1`
    `-4 < 2x < 6`
    Divide all parts by 2:
    `-4 / 2 < 2x / 2 < 6 / 2`
    `-2 < x < 3`

The solution set is all values of _x_ between -2 and 3, exclusive. In interval notation, this is (-2, 3).

**Number Line Representation:**

```
     <-----(-2)-----|--------(3)------->
                 (Open Circle)     (Open Circle)
```

**Example 2: Solve the inequality `|x + 3| ≥ 2`**

1.  **Apply the principle:**
    `x + 3 ≤ -2` or `x + 3 ≥ 2`

2.  **Solve for x:**

    - `x + 3 ≤ -2  =>  x ≤ -5`
    - `x + 3 ≥ 2  =>  x ≥ -1`

The solution set is all values of _x_ less than or equal to -5, or greater than or equal to -1. In interval notation, this is (-∞, -5] ∪ [-1, ∞).

**Number Line Representation:**

```
     <--------(-5)---|-------------------(-1)----->
                  [Closed Bracket]             [Closed Bracket]
```

**Code Example (Python) - Verifying Absolute Value Inequality Solutions:**

```plaintext
def check_absolute_value_inequality(x):
  """Checks if a given value satisfies the inequality |x + 3| >= 2."""
  return abs(x + 3) >= 2

# Test values
print(check_absolute_value_inequality(-6))  # Output: True
print(check_absolute_value_inequality(-3))  # Output: False
print(check_absolute_value_inequality(0))   # Output: True
print(check_absolute_value_inequality(-5)) # Output: True
print(check_absolute_value_inequality(-1)) # Output: True
```

## Tips and Common Mistakes

- **Remember to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.** This is a very common mistake!
- **When solving compound inequalities (e.g., with absolute values), consider all possible cases.**
- **Always check your solutions.** Substitute values from your solution set back into the original inequality to verify they satisfy the condition.
- **Pay attention to whether the endpoints are included in the solution set (using parentheses or brackets).** Open circles on a number line represent parentheses (exclusive), and closed circles/brackets represent inclusive.
- **For quadratic inequalities, understanding the graph of the quadratic function can be helpful.** The parabola opens upwards if the leading coefficient is positive, and downwards if it's negative.
