# KeyboardEvent.keyCode: Understanding Deprecated but Still Relevant Key Codes in JavaScript

In the world of web development, capturing and responding to keyboard input is crucial for creating interactive and engaging user experiences. The `KeyboardEvent.keyCode` property, while deprecated, remains a relevant concept for understanding how keyboard events were traditionally handled in JavaScript. This blog post delves into the intricacies of `keyCode`, its history, why it was deprecated, and what alternatives developers should use today.

## What is `KeyboardEvent.keyCode`?

The `KeyboardEvent.keyCode` property, part of the `KeyboardEvent` interface, provides a numerical code representing the key that was pressed or released on the keyboard. This code is specific to the physical key on the keyboard layout and is based on the legacy of the original ASCII character set.

For example, pressing the 'A' key might return a `keyCode` of 65 (its ASCII code), while pressing the 'Enter' key might return 13. The `keyCode` provided a way to identify which key was pressed regardless of the active keyboard layout or any modifiers (like Shift, Ctrl, or Alt).

## A Quick Code Example (Illustrative, but use with caution):

```plaintext
// Note: This code uses keyCode, which is deprecated. See alternatives below!
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  const keyCode = event.keyCode;
  console.log('Key Code:', keyCode);

  if (keyCode === 13) {
    console.log('Enter key was pressed!');
    // Perform some action, like submitting a form
  }
});
```

**Important Disclaimer:** While this code _might_ work, it's using a deprecated API. Don't rely on it for new projects. We'll discuss alternatives shortly.

## The Deprecation of `keyCode`

The `KeyboardEvent.keyCode` property has been deprecated for several reasons:

- **Lack of Standardization:** The numerical values returned by `keyCode` were not standardized across different browsers and keyboard layouts. This inconsistency led to cross-browser compatibility issues and made it difficult to write reliable keyboard event handlers.

- **Ambiguity:** `keyCode` only identified the physical key, not the character produced. Modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) weren't reliably reflected in the `keyCode`. This made it difficult to accurately determine the intended character or action.

- **Replacement with More Robust Properties:** Newer and more standardized properties, such as `key` and `code`, provide more accurate and consistent information about keyboard input.

## Understanding the Alternatives: `key` and `code`

Instead of `keyCode`, modern JavaScript development relies on the `key` and `code` properties of the `KeyboardEvent` object.

### 1. `KeyboardEvent.key`

The `key` property returns a string representing the _character_ that the user intended to input. It takes into account the active keyboard layout and any modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt).

- **Pros:**

  - More intuitive and readable.
  - Takes into account modifier keys and keyboard layouts.
  - Standardized across browsers.

- **Cons:**
  - May not be suitable for handling special keys (e.g., function keys, arrow keys), where you need the _physical_ key information.

**Example:**

```plaintext
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  const key = event.key;
  console.log('Key:', key);

  if (key === 'Enter') {
    console.log('Enter key was pressed!');
  } else if (key === 'a') {
    console.log('Lowercase "a" was pressed.');
  } else if (key === 'Shift') {
      console.log('Shift key was pressed');
  }
});
```

### 2. `KeyboardEvent.code`

The `code` property returns a string representing the _physical_ key on the keyboard that was pressed. This property is not affected by the active keyboard layout or modifier keys.

- **Pros:**

  - Consistent across different keyboard layouts.
  - Useful for handling physical key presses, regardless of the character they produce.
  - More precise for keyboard shortcuts and game development.

- **Cons:**
  - Less intuitive for general text input.
  - Requires knowledge of physical key codes.

**Example:**

```plaintext
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  const code = event.code;
  console.log('Code:', code);

  if (code === 'Enter') {
    console.log('Enter key was pressed!');
  } else if (code === 'KeyA') {
    console.log('The "A" key was pressed (regardless of shift state).');
  } else if (code === 'ShiftLeft') {
      console.log('Left Shift key was pressed.');
  }
});
```

## Choosing Between `key` and `code`

The choice between `key` and `code` depends on the specific requirements of your application:

- **For Character Input:** Use `key` when you need to capture the actual character being entered by the user. For example, if you're building a text editor or a form, `key` is the appropriate choice.

- **For Keyboard Shortcuts and Game Development:** Use `code` when you need to handle specific physical key presses, regardless of the keyboard layout or modifier keys. For example, if you're building a game where the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys control movement, `code` is the better choice.

- **General-Purpose:** If you want the most flexible and robust approach, consider using _both_ `key` and `code` in your event handler and adapt your logic based on the specific event.

## Browser Compatibility

While `keyCode` has broad legacy support, it's important to ensure your code is compatible with modern browsers using the recommended `key` and `code` properties. All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) support `key` and `code`.

**Polyfills (Generally Not Needed):** In most modern development scenarios, you won't need polyfills for `key` or `code` because they are well-supported. If you're targeting very old browsers (like IE8 and below), you might consider a polyfill library that attempts to emulate these properties, but this is becoming increasingly rare. It's generally better to encourage users to upgrade to a modern browser.

## Practical Examples: Combining `key` and `code`

Here's an example showing how you might combine `key` and `code` to handle both character input _and_ physical key presses:

```plaintext
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  const key = event.key;
  const code = event.code;

  console.log('Key:', key);
  console.log('Code:', code);

  if (key === 'Enter') {
    console.log('Enter key pressed (character input).');
    // Handle form submission or similar.
  }

  if (code === 'KeyR' && event.ctrlKey) {
    console.log('Ctrl+R pressed (physical key combination).');
    // Handle a refresh shortcut, for example.
  }

  if (code === 'ArrowUp') {
      console.log('Up arrow key pressed.');
      // Handle up arrow functionality.
  }
});
```

In this example, we handle:

- The 'Enter' key (based on character input).
- The "Ctrl+R" key combination (based on physical keys and a modifier).
- The Up Arrow Key (based on the physical key)

## Conclusion

While `KeyboardEvent.keyCode` provides a glimpse into the history of keyboard event handling in JavaScript, it's crucial to embrace the modern alternatives: `key` and `code`. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each property, you can create robust and cross-browser compatible keyboard event handlers that enhance the user experience of your web applications. Remember to prioritize `key` for character input and `code` for physical key handling, and consider combining both for maximum flexibility. By using the techniques described above you can ensure that your code behaves consistently and predictably across different browsers and keyboard layouts.
