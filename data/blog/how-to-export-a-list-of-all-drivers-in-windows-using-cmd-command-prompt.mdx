# How to Export a List of All Drivers in Windows using CMD (Command Prompt)

Maintaining an updated and well-documented list of your device drivers is crucial for system stability, troubleshooting hardware issues, and ensuring compatibility. While Windows provides Device Manager for viewing driver details, exporting a comprehensive list can be challenging. Fortunately, the Command Prompt (CMD) offers a simple and effective way to generate a text file containing all your driver information. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to exporting your driver list using CMD, along with explanations and tips for optimal results.

## Why Export Your Driver List?

There are several compelling reasons to export a list of your installed drivers:

- **Troubleshooting:** When experiencing hardware problems, a list of drivers allows you to quickly identify potentially problematic or outdated drivers.
- **Documentation:** Keeping a record of your drivers is essential for disaster recovery. If you need to reinstall your operating system, having a driver list simplifies the process of reinstalling the correct drivers.
- **Auditing:** In corporate environments, maintaining an audit trail of drivers is important for compliance and security.
- **Migration:** When migrating to a new computer, a driver list can help you identify the drivers you need to install on the new system.
- **Compatibility:** If you're planning to upgrade your operating system, a driver list can help you determine if your current drivers are compatible with the new version.

## Method 1: Using the `driverquery` Command

The most straightforward method to export a list of drivers is using the built-in `driverquery` command. This command provides a wealth of information about each driver installed on your system.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**

    - Press the Windows key, type "cmd," and right-click on "Command Prompt."
    - Select "Run as administrator." This is crucial because `driverquery` needs administrative privileges to access driver information correctly.

2.  **Execute the `driverquery` Command:**

    - In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:

    ```plaintext
    driverquery /v /fo csv > drivers.csv
    ```

    Let's break down this command:

    - `driverquery`: This is the main command to query driver information.
    - `/v`: This switch specifies verbose output, providing detailed information about each driver. Without this switch, you'll only get a basic list.
    - `/fo csv`: This switch specifies the output format as Comma Separated Values (CSV). This format is highly versatile and can be easily opened in spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc.
    - `>`: This is a redirection operator. It redirects the output of the `driverquery` command to a file.
    - `drivers.csv`: This specifies the name of the file to which the output will be redirected. You can change this to any name you prefer, but `.csv` is the recommended extension for compatibility with spreadsheet software.

3.  **Locate the Exported File:**
    - After the command executes, the `drivers.csv` file will be created in your user profile directory (usually `C:\Users\<YourUsername>`). You can open this file in a spreadsheet program to view the driver information.

**Understanding the `drivers.csv` File:**

The `drivers.csv` file will contain a comma-separated list of driver attributes. The exact columns will vary depending on your system and the drivers installed, but you can generally expect to see information like:

- **Module Name:** The name of the driver file (e.g., `netwbw02.sys`).
- **Display Name:** A human-readable name for the driver (e.g., `Intel(R) Wireless-AC 9260 160MHz`).
- **Description:** A brief description of the driver.
- **Driver Type:** Indicates the type of driver (e.g., `Kernel Driver`).
- **Link Date:** The date the driver was compiled or linked.
- **Path:** The full path to the driver file on your system.
- **Start Mode:** How the driver is started (e.g., `Auto`).
- **State:** The current state of the driver (e.g., `Running`).
- **Status:** The status of the driver (e.g., `OK`).

**Example `drivers.csv` Snippet:**

```csv
"Module Name","Display Name","Description","Driver Type","Link Date","Path","Start Mode","State","Status"
"ACPI.sys","","Microsoft ACPI Driver","Kernel Driver","07/06/2019 04:35:55","C:\Windows\System32\drivers\ACPI.sys","Boot","Running","OK"
"amdppm.sys","","AMD Processor Driver","Kernel Driver","09/19/2018 02:37:01","C:\Windows\System32\drivers\amdppm.sys","Boot","Running","OK"
"amdgpio2.sys","","AMD GPIO Driver 2","Kernel Driver","11/16/2022 03:39:59","C:\Windows\System32\drivers\amdgpio2.sys","Boot","Running","OK"
```

**Customizing the Output:**

- **Different Output Format:** Instead of `/fo csv`, you can use `/fo table` for a more human-readable tabular output in the command prompt. However, this format is less suitable for exporting to a file for further processing. You can also use `/fo list` for a list-based output, but CSV is generally preferred for its versatility.

  ```plaintext
  driverquery /v /fo table > drivers.txt
  ```

- **Filtering Drivers:** You can't directly filter drivers using `driverquery`. However, you can export the full list to a file and then use a text editor or spreadsheet application to filter and sort the data as needed.

## Method 2: Using PowerShell (Alternative Approach)

While `driverquery` is the standard CMD method, PowerShell offers another way to retrieve driver information. PowerShell provides more advanced filtering and manipulation capabilities.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**

    - Press the Windows key, type "powershell," and right-click on "Windows PowerShell."
    - Select "Run as administrator."

2.  **Execute the PowerShell Command:**

    - In the PowerShell window, type the following command and press Enter:

    ```powershell
    Get-WmiObject Win32_SystemDriver | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, PathName, Started, State, Status | Export-Csv -Path "drivers.csv" -NoTypeInformation
    ```

    Let's break down this command:

    - `Get-WmiObject Win32_SystemDriver`: This retrieves all system driver objects using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). WMI is a powerful interface for accessing and managing system information.
    - `Select-Object Name, DisplayName, PathName, Started, State, Status`: This selects the specific properties (columns) you want to include in the output. You can customize this list to include any other relevant properties available in the `Win32_SystemDriver` class. Refer to Microsoft's documentation for a complete list of available properties.
    - `Export-Csv -Path "drivers.csv" -NoTypeInformation`: This exports the selected data to a CSV file named "drivers.csv." The `-NoTypeInformation` parameter prevents PowerShell from adding type information headers to the CSV file, making it cleaner and easier to import into other applications.

3.  **Locate the Exported File:**
    - After the command executes, the `drivers.csv` file will be created in your user profile directory.

**Advantages of using PowerShell:**

- **More Control:** PowerShell allows for more granular control over the output and filtering of driver information. You can use PowerShell's powerful scripting capabilities to customize the output to meet your specific needs.
- **Easier Filtering:** PowerShell allows you to easily filter the driver list based on specific criteria. For example, you can filter for drivers that are not running, or drivers with a specific description.

**Example of Filtering in PowerShell:**

To export only drivers that are currently running, you could use the following command:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject Win32_SystemDriver | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Running"} | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, PathName, Started, State, Status | Export-Csv -Path "running_drivers.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

This command adds a `Where-Object` clause to filter the results, only including drivers where the `State` property is equal to "Running."

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

- **Always Run as Administrator:** Both `driverquery` and the PowerShell commands require administrator privileges to access all driver information.
- **Check the Output File:** After running the command, verify that the output file has been created and contains the expected data. If the file is empty or incomplete, double-check that you ran the command as administrator and that the syntax is correct.
- **Handle Large Outputs:** For systems with a large number of drivers, the output file can be quite large. Spreadsheet applications may have limitations on the number of rows or columns they can handle. Consider using a more powerful text editor or scripting language to process the data if necessary.
- **Use Quotes for Paths:** If the output path contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes. For example: `Export-Csv -Path "C:\My Documents\drivers.csv" -NoTypeInformation`
- **Encoding Issues:** In some cases, the CSV file might be encoded in a format that is not properly recognized by your spreadsheet application. Try saving the file with a different encoding (e.g., UTF-8) or opening it in a text editor to identify and correct any encoding issues.
