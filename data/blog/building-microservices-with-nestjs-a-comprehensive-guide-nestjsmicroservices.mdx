# Building Microservices with NestJS: A Comprehensive Guide (@nestjs/microservices)

Microservices are a popular architectural style for building complex applications, offering benefits like independent deployment, scalability, and fault isolation. NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, provides excellent support for building microservices, making the development process cleaner and more organized. This guide walks you through creating a microservice using NestJS and the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

## What are Microservices and Why NestJS?

Microservices architecture decomposes an application into a collection of small, autonomous services, modeled around a business domain. Each service is responsible for a specific task or set of tasks and communicates with other services over a network.

NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).  Here's why NestJS is a great choice for building microservices:

*   **Built-in Support:** NestJS has first-class support for microservices via the `@nestjs/microservices` package.
*   **Modularity:** Encourages modular design, making it easier to isolate concerns and develop independent services.
*   **TypeScript:** Provides static typing, leading to more robust and maintainable code.
*   **Dependency Injection:**  Makes your code testable and easier to manage dependencies.
*   **Decorators:**  Simplifies routing, validation, and other common tasks.
*   **Abstraction:**  Provides a consistent abstraction over different transport layers (e.g., TCP, Redis, RabbitMQ, gRPC, Kafka).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:**  (version 16 or higher recommended)
*   **npm or yarn:**  (Node package manager)
*   **Nest CLI:**  (Install globally using `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`)

## Setting up the Project

First, let's create a new NestJS project:

```bash
nest new my-microservice
```

Choose your package manager (npm or yarn) when prompted.  This will create a basic NestJS application.  Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-microservice
```

Next, install the `@nestjs/microservices` package:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/microservices @nestjs/platform-tcp  # or yarn add @nestjs/microservices @nestjs/platform-tcp
```

We're also installing `@nestjs/platform-tcp` because we'll be using TCP as our transport layer in this example.  NestJS supports various other transports like Redis, RabbitMQ, and gRPC.

## Creating the Microservice

Let's create a simple microservice that will perform a basic mathematical operation - squaring a number.

### 1. Define the Controller

Create a new file `math.controller.ts` inside the `src` directory:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param, ParseIntPipe } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MessagePattern } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Controller()
export class MathController {
  @MessagePattern('math.square') // Defines the message pattern
  square(data: number): number {
    return data * data;
  }
}
```

*   **`@MessagePattern('math.square')`**:  This decorator tells NestJS that this method should handle messages with the pattern `'math.square'`. This is how the microservice will identify which function to call when a message arrives.
*   **`square(data: number): number`**: This is the function that will be executed when a message with the pattern `'math.square'` is received. It takes a number as input and returns its square.
*   **`@Controller()`:** We still use the controller decorator for consistency within the NestJS framework.

### 2. Define the Module

Create a new file `math.module.ts` inside the `src` directory:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MathController } from './math.controller';

@Module({
  controllers: [MathController],
})
export class MathModule {}
```

This module registers the `MathController`, making its message handlers available.

### 3. Configure the Microservice Application

Modify the `main.ts` file to create a microservice application:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { MicroserviceOptions, Transport } from '@nestjs/microservices';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(AppModule, {
    transport: Transport.TCP,
    options: {
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3001,
    },
  });
  app.listen(); // Start listening for messages
}
bootstrap();
```

*   **`NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(...)`**: This creates a NestJS microservice application.
*   **`Transport.TCP`**:  Specifies that we're using TCP as the transport layer.  You can change this to `Transport.REDIS`, `Transport.RMQ` (RabbitMQ), `Transport.GRPC`, or `Transport.KAFKA` if you prefer.
*   **`options`**:  Configures the transport layer. In this case, we're specifying that the microservice should listen on `localhost` port `3001`.

### 4. Import the Math Module

Import the `MathModule` into `app.module.ts`:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { MathModule } from './math.module';

@Module({
  imports: [MathModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `AppModule` acts as the root module, importing the `MathModule` to make its controllers available.  We've left the `AppController` and `AppService` from the initial project setup; these are not directly used in our microservice example, but you'll likely use them if this microservice is part of a larger application.

## Testing the Microservice

Now that we've built our microservice, let's create a client application to interact with it.  This client will send messages to the microservice and receive responses.

### 1. Create a Client Application (within the same project or a separate one)

You can create another NestJS application within the same project (in a separate directory) or create a completely separate NestJS project for the client. For simplicity, let's assume we are using the existing `my-microservice` project and modifying the `AppController` and `AppService` to act as our client.

### 2.  Inject the Client Proxy

Modify `app.controller.ts` to inject the `ClientProxy`:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Inject, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ClientProxy } from '@nestjs/microservices';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Controller()
export class AppController implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(
    private readonly appService: AppService,
    @Inject('MATH_SERVICE') private readonly client: ClientProxy,
  ) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.client.connect();
  }

  @Get('/square/:number')
  getSquare(@Param('number') number: string) {
    const pattern = 'math.square';
    const payload = parseInt(number);
    return this.client.send<number, number>(pattern, payload);
  }
}
```

*   **`@Inject('MATH_SERVICE') private readonly client: ClientProxy`**: This injects a `ClientProxy` instance, which is used to communicate with the microservice.  The `'MATH_SERVICE'` token is used to identify the specific client configuration.
*   **`onModuleInit()`**:  This lifecycle hook is called when the module is initialized. We use it to establish the connection to the microservice using `this.client.connect()`. **Important:** Failing to connect will cause errors when trying to send messages.
*   **`@Get('/square/:number')`**: This defines an HTTP endpoint that accepts a number as a parameter.
*   **`this.client.send<number, number>(pattern, payload)`**: This sends a message to the microservice.
    *   `pattern`: The message pattern (`'math.square'`) that the microservice will use to identify the handler.
    *   `payload`: The data to send to the microservice (the number to be squared).
    *   `<number, number>`:  Specifies the types for the return type from the Microservice (`number`) and the type of the payload (`number`).  TypeScript's type system ensures proper data handling.
    *   This `send` method returns an Observable, which allows you to handle the response from the microservice asynchronously. We await this to ensure the result is available.

### 3. Configure the Client Proxy

Modify `app.module.ts` to configure the `ClientProxy`:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ClientsModule, Transport } from '@nestjs/microservices';
import { MathModule } from './math.module';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ClientsModule.register([
      {
        name: 'MATH_SERVICE',
        transport: Transport.TCP,
        options: {
          host: 'localhost',
          port: 3001,
        },
      },
    ]),
    MathModule,
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

*   **`ClientsModule.register(...)`**: This registers the `ClientProxy` with NestJS.
    *   `name`: The injection token (`'MATH_SERVICE'`) used to inject the client proxy into the `AppController`.
    *   `transport`:  The transport layer (`Transport.TCP`) must match the transport layer configured in the microservice.
    *   `options`:  The connection details (host and port) must match the microservice's configuration.

### 4. Running the Applications

First, start the microservice:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the NestJS application in development mode, which now functions as a microservice listening for messages on port 3001.

Then, in a separate terminal, start the client application (if you're using the same project, this is the same command):

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### 5. Testing with HTTP Request

Open your web browser or use a tool like `curl` or Postman to make an HTTP request to the client application:

```
http://localhost:3000/square/5
```

(Assuming your client application is running on port 3000, which is the default for a standard NestJS app).

You should see the result `25` in your browser, indicating that the client application successfully sent a message to the microservice, the microservice calculated the square, and the client received the result.

## Advanced Concepts

### Transport Layers

NestJS supports various transport layers beyond TCP:

*   **Redis:**  A popular in-memory data structure store, often used as a message broker.  Use `Transport.REDIS`.
*   **RabbitMQ:** A robust message broker implementation. Use `Transport.RMQ`.
*   **gRPC:** A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. Use `Transport.GRPC`.
*   **Kafka:** A distributed streaming platform.  Use `Transport.KAFKA`.

The choice of transport layer depends on your application's requirements. Consider factors like performance, reliability, and scalability.

### Request/Response vs. Event-Based Communication

*   **Request/Response (using `client.send()`):**  The client sends a message and waits for a response from the microservice. This is suitable for scenarios where the client needs immediate feedback.
*   **Event-Based (using `client.emit()`):** The client sends an event to the microservice without waiting for a response. This is suitable for scenarios where the client doesn't need immediate feedback and can tolerate eventual consistency.  Use the `@EventPattern()` decorator in the microservice to handle emitted events.  For example:

    ```typescript
    // In the client:
    this.client.emit('user.created', { userId: 123, username: 'testuser' });

    // In the microservice:
    import { EventPattern } from '@nestjs/microservices';

    @EventPattern('user.created')
    async handleUserCreated(data: { userId: number, username: string }) {
        console.log('User created:', data);
    }
    ```

### Error Handling

Proper error handling is crucial in microservices.  NestJS provides several mechanisms for handling errors:

*   **Exception Filters:**  You can define custom exception filters to handle exceptions globally.  These filters can catch specific exceptions and transform them into appropriate responses for the client.
*   **Try/Catch Blocks:**  Use try/catch blocks to handle errors within your message handlers.
*   **Observable Error Handling:**  Since `client.send()` returns an Observable, you can use the `catchError` operator to handle errors from the microservice.

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Inject, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ClientProxy, RpcException } from '@nestjs/microservices';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { catchError, throwError } from 'rxjs';

@Controller()
export class AppController implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(
    private readonly appService: AppService,
    @Inject('MATH_SERVICE') private readonly client: ClientProxy,
  ) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.client.connect();
  }

  @Get('/square/:number')
  getSquare(@Param('number') number: string) {
    const pattern = 'math.square';
    const payload = parseInt(number);
    return this.client.send<number, number>(pattern, payload).pipe(
      catchError(err => throwError(() => new RpcException(err.message))),
    );
  }
}
```

In the microservice, you can throw a `RpcException` to signal an error to the client.

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param, ParseIntPipe } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MessagePattern, RpcException } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Controller()
export class MathController {
  @MessagePattern('math.square') // Defines the message pattern
  square(data: number): number {
    if (data < 0) {
      throw new RpcException({ message: 'Number must be non-negative' });
    }
    return data * data;
  }
}
```

### Logging and Monitoring

Implement robust logging and monitoring to track the health and performance of your microservices. Use a centralized logging system to collect logs from all services. Monitor key metrics like request latency, error rates, and resource utilization.
