# Fix Windows Boot Issues with CMD: bootrec /fixmbr, /fixboot, /rebuildbcd

Experiencing trouble booting into Windows? Don't panic! Often, boot problems stem from a corrupted Master Boot Record (MBR), Boot Sector, or Boot Configuration Data (BCD). Fortunately, Windows provides powerful command-line tools within the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to diagnose and repair these issues. This guide will walk you through using `bootrec.exe` with its key commands: `/fixmbr`, `/fixboot`, and `/rebuildbcd` to get your system back on track.

## Understanding Boot Issues

Before diving into the solutions, let's understand the components involved in the Windows boot process and how they can become corrupted:

*   **Master Boot Record (MBR):** Located on the first sector of the hard drive, the MBR contains the boot loader code that initiates the operating system startup.
*   **Boot Sector:** Contains code specific to loading the Windows operating system. Each partition usually has its own boot sector.
*   **Boot Configuration Data (BCD):** A database containing boot configuration parameters, such as the location of the Windows installation and boot menus.

Corruption in any of these components can lead to error messages like "Operating System not found," "BOOTMGR is missing," or a system that simply refuses to boot.

## Prerequisites: Accessing the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)

To use `bootrec.exe`, you need to access the WinRE. Here's how:

1.  **Using Installation Media (Recommended):** The most reliable method. If you have a Windows installation disc or USB drive, boot from it.  Select your language and keyboard layout, then click "Repair your computer" or "Troubleshoot" followed by "Command Prompt".

2.  **Automatic Repair Loop (If Available):** Sometimes, Windows will automatically attempt a repair after a failed boot. Let it run and, if it fails, it may offer an option to access advanced troubleshooting options, leading you to the WinRE.

3.  **Forcing WinRE (Last Resort - Use with Caution):** If the above methods fail, you can force WinRE by repeatedly interrupting the Windows startup process.  Power on your computer and, as soon as you see the Windows logo, hold down the power button to force a shutdown. Repeat this process 2-3 times.  Windows should eventually boot into the WinRE. **Note:** This method can potentially cause data corruption if interrupted at the wrong time, so only use it if other options are unavailable.

Once in the WinRE, navigate to "Troubleshoot" > "Advanced options" > "Command Prompt".

## Using `bootrec.exe` Commands

Now that you have access to the Command Prompt within the WinRE, you can use the `bootrec.exe` commands to fix boot issues.

### 1. `bootrec /fixmbr`

This command writes a new MBR to the system partition.  It's useful if the MBR is corrupt or if it has been overwritten by a non-standard boot loader.

**How to use it:**

1.  Open Command Prompt in WinRE (as described above).
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```
    bootrec /fixmbr
    ```

    ```terminal
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.3693]
    (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    X:\Sources> bootrec /fixmbr
    The operation completed successfully.

    X:\Sources>
    ```

3.  After the command completes successfully, restart your computer.

**When to use it:**

*   You suspect the MBR is corrupt.
*   You have used a third-party partitioning tool that may have damaged the MBR.
*   You are experiencing boot errors related to the MBR.

### 2. `bootrec /fixboot`

This command writes a new boot sector to the system partition. Use this if the boot sector is damaged or corrupted.

**How to use it:**

1.  Open Command Prompt in WinRE.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```
    bootrec /fixboot
    ```

    ```terminal
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.3693]
    (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    X:\Sources> bootrec /fixboot
    The operation completed successfully.

    X:\Sources>
    ```

3.  After the command completes successfully, restart your computer.

**When to use it:**

*   You receive errors related to the boot sector.
*   Windows fails to start after installing a new operating system.
*   The boot sector is suspected of being infected with a virus.

### 3. `bootrec /rebuildbcd`

This command scans all disks for Windows installations and allows you to add them to the BCD store.  Use this if the BCD store is corrupt or missing.

**How to use it:**

1.  Open Command Prompt in WinRE.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```
    bootrec /rebuildbcd
    ```

    The command will scan your drives for Windows installations.  If it finds any, it will ask if you want to add them to the boot list.  Type `Y` for yes, then press Enter.

    ```terminal
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.3693]
    (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    X:\Sources> bootrec /rebuildbcd

    Scanning all disks for Windows installations.

    Please wait, since this may take a while...

    Successfully scanned Windows installations.

    Total identified Windows installations: 1

    [1] C:\Windows
        Add installation to boot list? Yes(Y)/No(N)/All(A): Y
    ```

3.  After the command completes successfully, restart your computer.

**When to use it:**

*   You receive errors related to the BCD store (e.g., "BOOTMGR is missing").
*   Windows fails to boot due to a corrupt BCD store.
*   You have installed a new operating system and it doesn't appear in the boot menu.
*   You have accidentally deleted boot entries.

### 4. `bootrec /scanos`

This command scans all disks for operating systems. It's useful to confirm if Windows installations are being detected. It does not make any changes to the system.

**How to use it:**

1.  Open Command Prompt in WinRE.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```
    bootrec /scanos
    ```

    The command will scan your drives for Windows installations and list them.

    ```terminal
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.3693]
    (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

    X:\Sources> bootrec /scanos

    Scanning all disks for Windows installations.

    Please wait, since this may take a while...

    Successfully scanned Windows installations.

    Total identified Windows installations: 1
    C:\Windows

    X:\Sources>
    ```

3.  This command does not require a restart.

**When to use it:**

*   To verify that Windows installations are being detected before running `/rebuildbcd`.
*   As a diagnostic step to identify available operating systems.

## Troubleshooting Tips

*   **Run Commands in Sequence:** In some cases, you may need to run all three `bootrec` commands (`/fixmbr`, `/fixboot`, and `/rebuildbcd`) in sequence to fully resolve the boot issue.

*   **Check Disk Health:** Before attempting boot repair, it's wise to check the health of your hard drive. You can use the `chkdsk` command with the `/f` and `/r` switches to check for and repair disk errors.  For example: `chkdsk C: /f /r` (replace `C:` with your Windows drive letter).  This process can take a considerable amount of time.

*   **Identify the Correct Drive:** Make sure you are targeting the correct drive when running commands.  You can use the `diskpart` command-line utility to list disks and partitions.  Type `diskpart`, then `list disk`, then `select disk <disk number>`, then `list partition` to identify the correct partition.  Once you are finished, type `exit` to leave `diskpart`.

*   **Secure Boot and UEFI/Legacy BIOS:**  If you are using a UEFI-based system, ensure that Secure Boot is properly configured in the BIOS/UEFI settings.  Sometimes, Secure Boot can interfere with boot loaders. Also, check if your system is booting in UEFI or Legacy BIOS mode, and adjust the settings accordingly. Mismatched boot modes can cause boot failures.

*   **Backup Your Data:** Before making any significant changes to your system, always back up your important data.  Boot issues can sometimes lead to data loss.

*   **Check for Hardware Issues:**  While boot problems are often software-related, hardware issues (e.g., a failing hard drive) can also be the culprit.  Consider running hardware diagnostics if you suspect a hardware problem.

## Conclusion

Using `bootrec.exe` with `/fixmbr`, `/fixboot`, and `/rebuildbcd` can be a lifesaver when your Windows system refuses to boot. By understanding the purpose of each command and following the troubleshooting tips, you can effectively diagnose and repair many common boot issues. Remember to back up your data and proceed with caution, and you'll be well on your way to restoring your Windows installation. If these steps don't work, consider a Windows reset or reinstallation as a last resort. Good luck!
