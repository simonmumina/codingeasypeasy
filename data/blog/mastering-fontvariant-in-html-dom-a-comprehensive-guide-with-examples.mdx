# Mastering `fontVariant` in HTML DOM: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

The `fontVariant` property in CSS (and accessible through the HTML DOM Style object) offers granular control over font variations, allowing you to enhance the visual appeal and legibility of your text. It provides a powerful way to style your web content beyond basic font families and sizes. This guide will explore the various aspects of `fontVariant`, its syntax, common usage scenarios, and practical examples to help you effectively implement it in your web projects.

## What is the `fontVariant` Property?

The `fontVariant` property is a shorthand CSS property that allows you to control the usage of OpenType font features related to variant forms of glyphs. These features include small caps, oldstyle figures, historical forms, and many more. It essentially opens up the power of font design to be used in specific areas of your web content.

While `fontVariant` itself is a shorthand property, it encompasses several related longhand properties, which we will explore in more detail.

## Understanding the Longhand Properties

Before diving into the practical examples, let's understand the core longhand properties that `fontVariant` encompasses:

- **`fontVariantAlternates`**: Controls the usage of alternate glyphs for characters. Useful for stylistic sets and character variants within a font.
- **`fontVariantCaps`**: Controls the display of capital letters, enabling small caps, all small caps, petite caps, all petite caps, unicase, and titling caps.
- **`fontVariantEastAsian`**: Controls the display of glyphs for East Asian scripts (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), enabling full-width, half-width, proportional width, ruby, and JIS78/83/90/2004 forms.
- **`fontVariantLigatures`**: Controls the usage of ligatures (combined characters like "fi" or "fl"). Enables common ligatures, discretionary ligatures, historical ligatures, and contextual alternates.
- **`fontVariantNumeric`**: Controls the display of numeric glyphs, enabling lining figures, oldstyle figures, proportional figures, tabular figures, diagonal fractions, and stacked fractions.
- **`fontVariantPosition`**: Controls the positioning of glyphs, allowing for superscript and subscript rendering within the font's design.
- **`fontVariantSettings`**: Provides fine-grained control over OpenType features using their feature tag names. This allows for accessing features not covered by the other longhand properties.

## Setting `fontVariant` in the HTML DOM Style Object

You can set the `fontVariant` property directly in your HTML using inline styles, in your CSS stylesheets, or dynamically using JavaScript and the HTML DOM Style object. Let's focus on using the DOM:

```plaintext
// Get a reference to the element you want to style
const element = document.getElementById('myElement')

// Set the fontVariant property using the DOM
element.style.fontVariant = 'small-caps'

// Or, set multiple variations using a space-separated list:
element.style.fontVariant = 'small-caps oldstyle-nums'
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We first obtain a reference to the HTML element we want to modify using `document.getElementById()`. You can use other methods like `querySelector` or `getElementsByClassName` depending on how you're targeting the element.
2.  Then, we access the `style` property of the element, which allows us to manipulate its CSS styles.
3.  We set the `fontVariant` property to the desired value. In the first example, we set it to `'small-caps'`, which will render the text in small capital letters. In the second example, we combine `small-caps` with `oldstyle-nums` to use oldstyle figures within the small caps setting.

## Practical Examples and Code Snippets

Here are several examples illustrating how to use different `fontVariant` values:

### 1. Small Caps

```plaintext
<p id="smallCapsExample">This is regular text.</p>

<script>
  document.getElementById('smallCapsExample').style.fontVariant = 'small-caps'
</script>

<style>
  #smallCapsExample {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>
```

This code snippet will render the text "This is regular text." with all letters, including lowercase, in small caps.

### 2. Oldstyle Figures

```plaintext
<p id="oldstyleNumsExample">1234567890</p>

<script>
  document.getElementById('oldstyleNumsExample').style.fontVariantNumeric = 'oldstyle-nums'
</script>

<style>
  #oldstyleNumsExample {
    font-family: Georgia, serif;
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

This example demonstrates how to render numbers using oldstyle figures, which blend better with lowercase text. Notice how the heights of the numbers vary, resembling lowercase letters. Importantly, we're using `fontVariantNumeric` directly instead of the shorthand `fontVariant`.

### 3. Combining Variations

```plaintext
<p id="combinedExample">Here's a title using small caps and oldstyle figures: 1234</p>

<script>
  const combinedElement = document.getElementById('combinedExample')
  combinedElement.style.fontVariantCaps = 'small-caps'
  combinedElement.style.fontVariantNumeric = 'oldstyle-nums'
</script>

<style>
  #combinedExample {
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;
    font-size: 22px;
  }
</style>
```

This example combines `small-caps` for the title and `oldstyle-nums` for the numbers within the title. We set the properties separately for better clarity and control. Note that while you _can_ use the shorthand `fontVariant`, it's generally recommended to use the longhand properties for better browser compatibility and clarity, especially when combining multiple variations.

### 4. Using `fontVariantAlternates`

This example requires a font that actually _contains_ alternate glyphs, which is less common. Let's assume we have a hypothetical font called "MyFancyFont" which includes stylistic sets.

```plaintext
<p id="alternatesExample">This text should use alternate glyphs.</p>

<script>
  const alternatesElement = document.getElementById('alternatesExample')
  alternatesElement.style.fontVariantAlternates = 'stylistic(4)' // Use stylistic set 4
</script>

<style>
  #alternatesExample {
    font-family: 'MyFancyFont', serif; /* Make sure this font is available */
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

This example uses the `stylistic()` function within `fontVariantAlternates` to select a specific stylistic set (in this case, set number 4). Replace `stylistic(4)` with the appropriate stylistic set or character variant for your font. Refer to your font's documentation to find the available alternates.

**Important Note:** The effectiveness of `fontVariantAlternates` heavily depends on the font being used and its support for alternate glyphs. Many standard web fonts don't include extensive alternate glyph sets.

### 5. Ligatures

```plaintext
<p id="ligaturesExample">fi fl ff ffi ffl</p>

<script>
  const ligaturesElement = document.getElementById('ligaturesExample')
  ligaturesElement.style.fontVariantLigatures =
    'common-ligatures discretionary-ligatures historical-ligatures'
</script>

<style>
  #ligaturesExample {
    font-family: 'Garamond', serif; /* Garamond often includes good ligatures */
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

This example enables common, discretionary, and historical ligatures. You'll likely see the "fi", "fl", "ff", "ffi", and "ffl" combinations rendered as single glyphs where the font supports it.

### 6. Disabling Ligatures

Sometimes you may want to _disable_ ligatures, which you can do like this:

```plaintext
<p id="noLigaturesExample">fi fl ff ffi ffl</p>

<script>
  const noLigaturesElement = document.getElementById('noLigaturesExample')
  noLigaturesElement.style.fontVariantLigatures =
    'no-common-ligatures no-discretionary-ligatures no-historical-ligatures'
</script>

<style>
  #noLigaturesExample {
    font-family: 'Garamond', serif;
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

This ensures that the character combinations are rendered as individual letters, even if the font supports ligatures.

## Browser Compatibility

`fontVariant` and its longhand properties enjoy good support in modern browsers. However, it's crucial to test your implementation across different browsers, especially older versions of Internet Explorer. While the shorthand property `fontVariant` might have inconsistencies, using the longhand properties individually generally provides more reliable results. Use a resource like [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/) to check the specific compatibility for each longhand property.

## Accessibility Considerations

While `fontVariant` enhances visual presentation, ensure your text remains accessible to all users.

- **Avoid Overuse:** Don't overuse `fontVariant` to the point where it hinders readability. Excessive small caps or unusual glyphs can make text difficult to read for users with visual impairments or reading disabilities.
- **Test with Screen Readers:** Always test your website with screen readers to ensure that the text is properly announced and interpreted, even with `fontVariant` applied. Some screen readers may not correctly handle all font variations.
- **Provide Alternatives:** If certain font variations are critical to conveying meaning, consider providing alternative text or descriptions for users who cannot see or interpret them correctly.

## When to Use `fontVariant`

`fontVariant` is best used in the following scenarios:

- **Typography Enhancement:** To improve the overall aesthetic appeal of your text, particularly in headings, titles, or body text where subtle variations can make a difference.
- **Specific Text Elements:** To style specific text elements like numbers in tables, code snippets, or footnotes, using variations like oldstyle figures or tabular figures.
- **Working with Fonts Designed for Variants:** When using fonts that are specifically designed to take advantage of font variations, such as fonts with extensive ligature sets or stylistic alternates.
- **Historical or Thematic Styling:** To evoke a specific historical period or theme by using historical forms or ligatures.

## Conclusion

The `fontVariant` property and its associated longhand properties provide a powerful toolkit for fine-tuning the typography of your web content. By understanding the available options and experimenting with different variations, you can significantly enhance the visual appeal and readability of your website. Remember to prioritize accessibility and test your implementations thoroughly across different browsers to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience. Using the DOM to manipulate these styles dynamically opens up a whole new world of interactive typography possibilities.
