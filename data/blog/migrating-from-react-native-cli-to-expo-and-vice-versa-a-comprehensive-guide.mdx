# Migrating from React Native CLI to Expo (and Vice Versa): A Comprehensive Guide

Choosing the right development environment is crucial for building successful React Native applications.  React Native offers two primary approaches: the CLI (Command Line Interface) and Expo. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough on migrating your React Native project between these two environments, enabling you to leverage the benefits of both. Whether you're moving from CLI to Expo for easier development and over-the-air updates or from Expo to CLI for greater control and native module integration, this article will help you navigate the process smoothly.

## Understanding the Differences: CLI vs. Expo

Before diving into the migration, let's briefly understand the core differences between React Native CLI and Expo:

*   **React Native CLI:**  Offers maximum flexibility and control.  You have direct access to native code (Objective-C/Swift for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android), allowing you to integrate any native module. It provides a more bare-bones approach, requiring more setup and configuration.

*   **Expo:**  Provides a higher-level, managed environment.  It simplifies development with pre-built components, APIs, and tools.  Expo Go allows for easy testing on devices without the need for native builds for many tasks.  It offers over-the-air updates and a smoother onboarding experience.  However, it has limitations regarding native module usage. You'll typically need to use "Expo Go" or "development builds" initially, and then "EAS Build" (Expo Application Services) for production builds or use "prebuild" to create classic React Native projects to use custom native modules.

## Why Migrate?

The reasons for migrating can vary depending on your project's needs:

*   **CLI to Expo:**
    *   **Faster Development:** Expo's pre-built components and tooling accelerate the development process.
    *   **Simplified Testing:** Expo Go makes it easy to test your app on physical devices without complex build processes.
    *   **Over-the-Air Updates:**  Update your app without submitting new versions to the app stores (with limitations).
    *   **Easier Onboarding:** Expo provides a more accessible entry point for new developers.

*   **Expo to CLI:**
    *   **Native Module Integration:** Gain the ability to use any native module, regardless of whether it's supported by Expo.
    *   **Fine-Grained Control:**  Have complete control over the native code and build process.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize performance at the native level.
    *   **Specific Native Functionality:** Access device features or SDKs not available through Expo.

## Migrating from React Native CLI to Expo

This process involves creating a new Expo project and then copying over your existing code.

### Step 1: Create a New Expo Project

First, create a new Expo project using the Expo CLI:

```bash
npx create-expo-app MyExpoApp
cd MyExpoApp
```

You'll be prompted to choose a template. Select the "blank" template (or the "blank (TypeScript)" template if you are using TypeScript). This gives you a clean slate to work with.

### Step 2: Copy Your Code

Copy your JavaScript/TypeScript code (excluding the `ios`, `android`, and `node_modules` directories) from your CLI project into the new Expo project. Make sure to copy the `src` folder, the `App.js` (or `App.tsx`), and any other relevant files.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Identify the dependencies used in your CLI project and install the equivalent packages in your Expo project using `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`:

```bash
# Example using npm
npm install <dependency1> <dependency2> <...>
```

**Important Considerations for Expo Packages:**

*   **Expo Managed Modules:** Use the Expo versions of commonly used libraries like `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-screens`, `expo-haptics`, and `expo-location`.  These are often optimized for the Expo environment.

*   **Expo Compatibility:** Check the Expo documentation or use the `expo install` command to install compatible versions of libraries:

    ```bash
    npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
    ```

*   **Web Compatibility:**  Expo emphasizes cross-platform compatibility, including web.  Consider using libraries that support web if you plan to target web platforms.

### Step 4: Update Imports

Update your import statements to use the Expo versions of modules. For example:

```javascript
// CLI
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

// Expo
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'; // No change usually if using Expo optimized modules
```

However, for some modules, you might have a different import path. Consult the Expo documentation for the specific module.

### Step 5: Configure `app.json`

The `app.json` file in your Expo project is crucial for configuring your app.  Review and update it with your app's name, bundle identifier, package name, and other relevant settings.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyExpoApp",
    "slug": "my-expo-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "updates": {
      "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": [
      "**/*"
    ],
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.myexpoapp"
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF"
      },
      "package": "com.example.myexpoapp"
    },
    "web": {
      "favicon": "./assets/favicon.png"
    },
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "YOUR_EAS_PROJECT_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Considerations for `app.json`:**

*   **`expo.name` and `expo.slug`:** These define the name of your app and its identifier.
*   **`expo.ios.bundleIdentifier` and `expo.android.package`:**  These are crucial for deploying to the App Store and Google Play Store.
*   **`expo.updates`:**  Configure over-the-air updates.
*   **`expo.extra.eas.projectId`:**  The project ID for EAS Build (obtained after initializing EAS).

### Step 6:  Address Native Module Dependencies

This is often the trickiest part. If your CLI project relies on native modules that are *not* supported by Expo out-of-the-box, you have several options:

1.  **Find Expo Equivalents:**  Check if there are Expo-compatible alternatives to the native modules you're using.  Expo provides wrappers for many common native APIs.
2.  **Expo Plugins:**  Use Expo Config Plugins to configure native dependencies during the build process.  This allows you to use some native modules while still benefiting from the Expo managed workflow.  Create a `plugins` array in `app.json` to configure this.
3.  **Development Builds:**  Create development builds to include custom native modules while still using the Expo development workflow. This uses Expo's EAS Build infrastructure.
4.  **"prebuild" and ExpoKit (Rare):** You could "eject" to a classic React Native project using `expo prebuild`, but this almost defeats the purpose of moving to Expo. This creates the `ios` and `android` directories. ExpoKit (the managed app wrapper) is deprecated, and using 'eject' or 'prebuild' should be a carefully considered choice. It's typically best to start with a managed Expo app and only eject if absolutely necessary.
5. **Bare Workflow:** Start a new Expo "bare" workflow project to create a minimal React Native app with Expo libraries preinstalled. This is a more manual approach but gives you fine-grained control.

**Example: Using `expo-image-picker` to replace a custom image picker:**

Let's say your CLI app used a custom native module for image picking. You could replace it with `expo-image-picker`:

```javascript
// Install the Expo package
npx expo install expo-image-picker

// Use the Expo module in your component
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';
import { Button, Image } from 'react-native';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState(null);

  const pickImage = async () => {
    // No permissions request is necessary for launching the image library
    let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.All,
      allowsEditing: true,
      aspect: [4, 3],
      quality: 1,
    });

    console.log(result);

    if (!result.canceled) {
      setImage(result.assets[0].uri);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Button title="Pick an image from camera roll" onPress={pickImage} />
      {image && <Image source={{ uri: image }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 7: Run Your App

Start your Expo app using:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser.  You can then run your app on an emulator/simulator or your physical device using the Expo Go app.

### Step 8: Testing and Debugging

Thoroughly test your app after the migration. Pay close attention to:

*   **Component Rendering:** Ensure all components render correctly.
*   **API Calls:** Verify that API calls are working as expected.
*   **Native Features:**  Test features that rely on native modules (if you've successfully migrated them).
*   **Platform-Specific Code:**  Check that platform-specific code (using `Platform.OS`) is handled correctly.

Use the React Native debugger or Expo's development tools for debugging.

## Migrating from Expo to React Native CLI

This process allows you to have full control over your native projects. The general procedure involves using `expo prebuild` or initiating a bare workflow project.

### Step 1: "Prebuild" Your Expo Project or start Bare Workflow

Run the prebuild command:

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

This command will create the `ios` and `android` directories in your project, containing the native code for each platform. You'll be prompted to select the build type (classic, managed, bare). The 'classic' option is appropriate for most projects that need to eject from the managed workflow to use custom native modules.

Alternatively, create a new Expo "bare" workflow project:

```bash
npx create-expo-app -t bare my-bare-app
```

This initializes a project with a minimal React Native setup using Expo libraries.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure all required dependencies are installed.  `expo prebuild` typically handles this, but you might need to manually install some packages.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Configure Native Projects (iOS and Android)

Open the `ios` and `android` directories in Xcode and Android Studio, respectively.

*   **iOS (Xcode):**
    *   Open `ios/MyProject.xcworkspace`.
    *   Configure your signing certificates and provisioning profiles.
    *   Build and run the app on a simulator or device.
*   **Android (Android Studio):**
    *   Open `android/` as an existing project.
    *   Configure your signing keys.
    *   Build and run the app on an emulator or device.

### Step 4: Linking Native Modules

If you're using native modules that require linking (which is often the case when migrating from Expo, as this is the main reason to do so), you'll need to manually link them using `react-native link` or by modifying the native build files (e.g., `Podfile` for iOS, `build.gradle` for Android). However, `react-native link` is deprecated. The recommended approach is to use autolinking or manual linking.

**Autolinking:**

Autolinking automatically discovers and links native modules.  It requires that the modules follow a specific structure and that you run:

```bash
npx react-native autolink
```

**Manual Linking:**

Manual linking involves modifying the native project files directly.

*   **iOS:**  Add the necessary files and libraries to your Xcode project.  Modify the `Podfile` if you're using CocoaPods.  Run `pod install` to install the dependencies.
*   **Android:**  Add the necessary files and dependencies to your `build.gradle` files.  Update the `settings.gradle` file to include the module.  Modify the `MainApplication.java` file to register the module.

**Example: Manually linking a native module in Android:**

1.  **Add the module to `settings.gradle`:**

    ```gradle
    include ':your-module'
    project(':your-module').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/your-module/android')
    ```

2.  **Add the dependency to `android/app/build.gradle`:**

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        implementation project(':your-module')
    }
    ```

3.  **Register the module in `MainApplication.java`:**

    ```java
    import com.yourmodule.YourModulePackage;

    import java.util.Arrays;
    import java.util.List;

    public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
      // ...

      @Override
      protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        @SuppressWarnings("UnnecessaryLocalVariable")
        List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
        // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
        // packages.add(new MyReactNativePackage());
        packages.add(new YourModulePackage()); // Add your module here
        return packages;
      }

      // ...
    }
    ```

### Step 5: Remove Unnecessary Expo Dependencies

You can now safely remove Expo dependencies that are no longer required.  This can reduce your app's size and improve performance.

```bash
npm uninstall expo expo-constants expo-splash-screen  # Example. Adjust according to your used modules.
```

### Step 6: Update Code for Native APIs

Update your code to use the native APIs directly instead of relying on Expo wrappers. For example, if you were using `expo-location`, you would now need to use the native location APIs.

### Step 7: Testing and Debugging

Thoroughly test your app on both iOS and Android.  Use the native debugging tools (Xcode debugger, Android Studio debugger) to identify and fix any issues.  Pay close attention to the functionality of the native modules you've integrated.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Module Not Found:** Double-check that all required dependencies are installed and correctly linked.  Clear your `node_modules` directory and reinstall dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
*   **Build Errors:**  Review the build logs in Xcode or Android Studio for detailed error messages.  Ensure that your signing certificates and provisioning profiles are correctly configured.
*   **Runtime Crashes:** Use the native debugging tools to identify the cause of the crashes.  Check for null pointer exceptions, memory leaks, and other common errors.
*   **UI Issues:**  Inspect the UI elements in the native debugging tools to ensure they are rendering correctly.  Adjust the layout and styling as needed.
*   **Incompatible Native Module:** Ensure your native module is compatible with the React Native version you're using. Look at version numbers and dependencies.

## Best Practices for a Smooth Migration

*   **Plan Carefully:**  Before starting the migration, carefully plan the process and identify all dependencies and potential issues.
*   **Commit Frequently:**  Commit your changes frequently to a version control system (e.g., Git) so you can easily revert if something goes wrong.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Thoroughly test your app after the migration to ensure that everything is working as expected.
*   **Document Everything:**  Document the migration process and any changes you make to the code.
*   **Seek Help When Needed:** Don't hesitate to ask for help from the React Native community or consult with experienced developers.
