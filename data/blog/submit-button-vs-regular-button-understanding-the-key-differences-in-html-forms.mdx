# Submit Button vs. Regular Button: Understanding the Key Differences in HTML Forms

In web development, buttons are crucial for user interaction. Two common types of buttons found in HTML forms are the **submit button** and the **regular button**. While they may appear similar visually, they serve distinct purposes and exhibit different behaviors. Understanding these differences is essential for building functional and user-friendly web applications.

This comprehensive guide will delve into the key differences between submit buttons and regular buttons, providing clear explanations and practical code examples to help you make informed decisions about which type of button to use in your projects.

## The `&lt;button&gt;` Element and the `&lt;input type="button"&gt;` Element: Clarifying the Confusion

Before we dive into the differences between submit and regular buttons, let's address a common source of confusion: the use of the `&lt;button&gt;` element and the `&lt;input type="button"&gt;` element.  Both can be used to create buttons, but the `&lt;button&gt;` element offers more flexibility.

**`&lt;button&gt;` element:**

*   **Purpose:** Creates a button that can contain HTML content (text, images, etc.).  It's the preferred way to create buttons in most modern web development scenarios.
*   **Default type:** The default `type` attribute for the `&lt;button&gt;` element is `submit` if it's placed inside a `&lt;form&gt;`. If it's not in a form, the default `type` is `button`. This is a crucial point to remember!
*   **Flexibility:**  You can easily style the content within the button using CSS and include other HTML elements.

**`&lt;input type="button"&gt;` element:**

*   **Purpose:**  Creates a simple button, typically used for client-side scripting.
*   **Content:** The button's text is defined by the `value` attribute. It cannot contain HTML content.
*   **Less Flexible:**  Less flexible than the `&lt;button&gt;` element for styling and content.

In this article, when we discuss "regular buttons," we're typically referring to the `<button type="button">` element, as it's the most common way to create a standard button that doesn't automatically submit a form.  However, the information generally applies to `<input type="button">` as well.

## 1. Functionality: What Each Button Does

The primary distinction between submit buttons and regular buttons lies in their core functionality within an HTML form.

*   **Submit Button (`&lt;button type="submit"&gt;` or `&lt;input type="submit"&gt;`):** This button's primary job is to **submit the form** data to the server for processing. When clicked, it gathers all the data entered in the form fields (e.g., text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons) and sends it to the URL specified in the form's `action` attribute.

*   **Regular Button (`&lt;button type="button"&gt;` or `&lt;input type="button"&gt;`):** This button is designed for **client-side scripting** using JavaScript. It doesn't have any inherent form submission behavior. Clicking it simply triggers a JavaScript function that you define.  It's a blank canvas for interactivity.

**Code Example (Submit Button):**

```html
<form action="/submit-form" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  <!-- OR -->
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this example, clicking the submit button will send the "name" and "email" data to the `/submit-form` endpoint using the `POST` method.

**Code Example (Regular Button):**

```html
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me</button>
<!-- OR -->
<input type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="myFunction()">

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("Button was clicked!");
}
</script>
```

In this example, clicking the button will execute the `myFunction()` JavaScript function, displaying an alert. No form submission occurs.

## 2. Default Behavior: The Hidden Gotchas

Understanding the default behavior of buttons is crucial for avoiding unexpected results, especially within forms.

*   **Submit Button (in a form):** By default, if a `&lt;button&gt;` element is placed *inside* a `&lt;form&gt;` element, and its `type` attribute is *not explicitly specified*, it defaults to `type="submit"`. This can be a common source of errors if you intend to create a regular button but forget to set `type="button"`.  Therefore, always explicitly define the `type` attribute.

*   **Regular Button:** The default behavior is to do nothing unless you attach a JavaScript event handler (like `onclick`).

**Example of Unexpected Submit Behavior:**

```html
<form action="/submit-form" method="post">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br><br>

  <button>Save</button>  <!-- Oops!  This will submit the form! -->
</form>
```

In the above example, the button labeled "Save" will, surprisingly, submit the form because its `type` attribute defaults to "submit" within the `&lt;form&gt;` context. To prevent this, you should explicitly write `<button type="button">Save</button>`.

## 3. Event Handling: How to Make Buttons Interactive

Both submit and regular buttons can be made interactive using JavaScript event handlers. However, the events they trigger and the associated actions differ.

*   **Submit Button:** The primary event associated with a submit button is the `submit` event of the form itself, *not* the button's `click` event. You typically attach an event listener to the `&lt;form&gt;` element to handle form submission.

*   **Regular Button:** The primary event associated with a regular button is the `click` event. You attach an event listener directly to the button element to execute JavaScript code when it's clicked.

**Code Example (Handling Submit Button Click with JavaScript - Best Practice is to handle FORM submit):**

```html
<form id="myForm" action="/submit-form" method="post">
  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message"></textarea><br><br>

  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

<script>
  const form = document.getElementById('myForm');

  form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission

    // Perform validation or other actions here
    const message = document.getElementById('message').value;
    if (message.trim() === "") {
      alert("Please enter a message.");
      return; // Stop submission if validation fails
    }

    // Simulate form submission (replace with actual AJAX call)
    alert("Form submitted successfully!");
    console.log("Message:", message);
    // You would typically send the data to the server using fetch or XMLHttpRequest here
  });
</script>
```

In this example, we're preventing the default form submission and handling the submission logic within the JavaScript code. This allows for client-side validation, AJAX calls, and other dynamic behaviors.

**Code Example (Handling Regular Button Click):**

```html
<button type="button" id="myButton">Do Something</button>

<script>
  const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Perform actions when the button is clicked
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
  });
</script>
```

In this example, clicking the button changes the background color of the page.

## 4. Use Cases: Choosing the Right Button for the Job

The choice between a submit button and a regular button depends entirely on the intended functionality.

*   **Use a Submit Button when:**

    *   You need to submit the form data to a server-side script (e.g., PHP, Node.js, Python) for processing.
    *   You want the browser to handle the form submission process automatically (e.g., navigating to a new page).
    *   You need to trigger server-side validation or database updates.

*   **Use a Regular Button when:**

    *   You need to perform client-side actions without submitting the form (e.g., displaying a modal, toggling content visibility, manipulating the DOM).
    *   You want to handle form submission entirely with JavaScript (e.g., using AJAX to submit the data in the background).
    *   You need to create interactive elements that are not directly related to form submission.
    *   You want to perform client-side validation *before* potential form submission.

**Real-World Examples:**

*   **Submit Button:**  Login forms, registration forms, contact forms, checkout pages.
*   **Regular Button:** "Add to Cart" button (typically using AJAX), "Show More" button (expanding a content section), buttons that trigger animations or special effects.

## 5. Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is crucial in web development. Here's how to make sure both types of buttons are accessible:

*   **Semantic HTML:** Always use the correct semantic HTML elements (`&lt;button&gt;`, `&lt;input type="submit"&gt;`, `&lt;input type="button"&gt;`) to ensure proper screen reader behavior.
*   **Clear Labels:** Provide clear and descriptive labels for your buttons, either through the button's text content or using the `aria-label` attribute.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that buttons are focusable using the `tab` key and can be activated using the `enter` or `spacebar` keys. This is usually handled automatically by the browser for native button elements, but you should test it.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-describedby`, `aria-pressed`) to provide additional information to screen reader users about the button's purpose or state.

**Example with ARIA Attributes:**

```html
<button type="button" aria-label="Close Menu" onclick="closeMenu()">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="times" class="svg-inline--fa fa-times fa-w-11" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 352 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M242.72 256l100.08-100.08c4.68-4.68 4.68-12.28 0-16.97l-28.28-28.28c-4.69-4.69-12.29-4.69-16.97 0L197.44 210.72l-100.08-100.08c-4.68-4.68-12.28-4.68-16.97 0l-28.28 28.28c-4.69 4.69-4.69 12.29 0 16.97L151.28 256 51.2 356.08c-4.68 4.68-4.68 12.28 0 16.97l28.28 28.28c4.69 4.69 12.29 4.69 16.97 0L197.44 301.28l100.08 100.08c4.68 4.68 12.28 4.68 16.97 0l28.28-28.28c4.69-4.69 4.69-12.29 0-16.97L242.72 256z"/></svg>
</button>
```

In this example, we use `aria-label` to provide a text label for the button, even though it contains only an icon.  `aria-hidden="true"` on the SVG element ensures that the screen reader doesn't attempt to interpret the visual icon content as text. `focusable="false"` prevents the SVG from being focusable in older browsers which might attempt to do so.

## Conclusion: Choosing Wisely

The difference between a submit button and a regular button is fundamental to HTML form handling. Choose the right button type for the task at hand to avoid unexpected behavior and create a more user-friendly and accessible web experience.  Remember to explicitly define the `type` attribute of your `<button>` elements, especially when they're inside `<form>` elements.  By understanding the nuances of each button type, you can build more robust and interactive web applications.
