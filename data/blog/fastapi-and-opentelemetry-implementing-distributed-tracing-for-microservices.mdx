# FastAPI and OpenTelemetry: Implementing Distributed Tracing for Microservices

As your FastAPI applications grow, especially when adopting a microservices architecture, understanding the flow of requests across different services becomes crucial. Identifying performance bottlenecks and debugging issues can be significantly challenging without proper observability. This is where **distributed tracing** comes in.

This blog post will guide you through integrating **FastAPI** with **OpenTelemetry** to implement distributed tracing. We'll cover setting up OpenTelemetry, instrumenting your FastAPI application, configuring exporters to send tracing data, and visualizing the traces using Jaeger.  By the end of this guide, you'll have a robust system for monitoring and debugging your FastAPI-based microservices.

## What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing is a method of profiling and monitoring applications built on a microservices architecture. It allows you to track requests as they propagate through different services, providing insights into latency, error rates, and the overall flow of execution. This information is invaluable for identifying performance bottlenecks, understanding dependencies, and debugging issues that span multiple services.

## Why OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral, open-source observability framework for cloud-native software. It provides a set of APIs, SDKs, and tools for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (traces, metrics, and logs).

**Key benefits of using OpenTelemetry:**

*   **Vendor Neutrality:** Avoid vendor lock-in and easily switch between different observability backends.
*   **Standardization:** Provides a common standard for instrumenting applications, making it easier to integrate with various observability tools.
*   **Wide Adoption:** Supported by a large community and a wide range of observability platforms.
*   **Flexibility:** Supports various programming languages and frameworks.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.7+**
*   **Docker (Optional, for Jaeger)**
*   **pip**

## Step 1: Setting up the FastAPI Project

Let's start by creating a simple FastAPI application.

```bash
mkdir fastapi-opentelemetry
cd fastapi-opentelemetry
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Create a file named `main.py` and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

You can run this application using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the "Hello World" message.

## Step 2: Installing OpenTelemetry Dependencies

Now, let's install the necessary OpenTelemetry packages:

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```

**Explanation of the packages:**

*   `opentelemetry-api`:  Provides the OpenTelemetry API definitions.
*   `opentelemetry-sdk`:  Implements the OpenTelemetry SDK, responsible for creating and managing spans.
*   `opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger`: Exports tracing data to Jaeger. You can replace this with other exporters like Zipkin or OTLP.
*   `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`:  Automatically instruments FastAPI applications for tracing.
*   `opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests`: Instruments the `requests` library for tracing outgoing HTTP requests. This is useful for tracing calls to other services.

## Step 3: Configuring OpenTelemetry

Create a new file named `instrumentation.py` and add the following code:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from fastapi import FastAPI

def configure_tracer(app: FastAPI):
    resource = Resource(attributes={
        SERVICE_NAME: "my-fastapi-service" # Change this to your service name
    })

    tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
    trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

    jaeger_exporter = JaegerExporter(
        agent_host_name="localhost",  #  Jaeger agent host
        agent_port=6831,  # Jaeger agent port
    )

    span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(jaeger_exporter)
    tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)

    FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app, tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
    RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()

```

**Explanation:**

*   **Resource:**  Defines metadata about the service being instrumented (e.g., service name). This helps identify the service in the tracing backend.
*   **TracerProvider:**  Provides access to the tracer, which is responsible for creating spans.
*   **JaegerExporter:** Configures the Jaeger exporter to send tracing data to a Jaeger instance.  You can configure `agent_host_name` and `agent_port` to point to your Jaeger instance. The default values are `localhost` and `6831` respectively, which are suitable if you're running Jaeger locally.
*   **BatchSpanProcessor:**  Buffers spans before sending them to the exporter, improving performance.
*   **FastAPIInstrumentor:**  Automatically instruments the FastAPI application, capturing information about incoming requests and responses.
*   **RequestsInstrumentor:** Instruments the `requests` library to trace outgoing HTTP requests.

## Step 4: Integrating OpenTelemetry with FastAPI

Modify `main.py` to import and call the `configure_tracer` function from `instrumentation.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from instrumentation import configure_tracer
import requests

app = FastAPI()
configure_tracer(app)


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}


@app.get("/call_external")
async def call_external():
    response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get") # An example external API
    return {"message": "External API response", "data": response.json()}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

**Changes:**

*   Imported `configure_tracer` from `instrumentation.py`.
*   Called `configure_tracer(app)` before defining the routes.
*   Added a new endpoint `/call_external` which makes a request to an external API using the `requests` library. This will demonstrate how OpenTelemetry traces requests across service boundaries.

## Step 5: Running Jaeger (Optional but Recommended)

The easiest way to run Jaeger is using Docker.  Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run -d -p 16686:16686 -p 6831:6831/udp jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

This command will start a Jaeger instance in all-in-one mode, which is suitable for development and testing.  Jaeger's UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:16686`.

## Step 6: Running the Application and Viewing Traces

Now, run the FastAPI application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Visit the following endpoints in your browser or using `curl`:

*   `http://localhost:8000/`
*   `http://localhost:8000/call_external`

After making these requests, open the Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`.  You should see traces for your FastAPI application, including the requests to the `/` and `/call_external` endpoints.

You can filter the traces by service name (`my-fastapi-service` in this example) and operation name (e.g., `GET /`).  Clicking on a trace will show you the individual spans, including the time spent in each operation and any relevant metadata.  For the `/call_external` endpoint, you'll see a span representing the request to `https://httpbin.org/get`.

## Advanced Configuration and Customization

### Adding Custom Attributes to Spans

You can add custom attributes to spans to provide more context about the operations being traced. For example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from instrumentation import configure_tracer
import requests
from opentelemetry import trace

app = FastAPI()
configure_tracer(app)


@app.get("/")
async def root(request: Request):
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_custom_operation") as span:
        span.set_attribute("http.client_ip", request.client.host)
        return {"message": "Hello World"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

In this example, we create a custom span named "my_custom_operation" and add an attribute `http.client_ip` containing the client's IP address. This information will be visible in the Jaeger UI within the span details.

### Propagating Context Across Services

If you're calling other services from your FastAPI application, it's important to propagate the tracing context to ensure that the traces are correlated.  The `RequestsInstrumentor` automatically handles this when using the `requests` library.  However, if you are using other HTTP clients or message queues, you may need to manually propagate the context.

### Sampling

In production environments, you may want to sample traces to reduce the volume of data being collected.  You can configure the sampling strategy when initializing the `TracerProvider`.

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import TraceIdRatioBased

# Sample 50% of traces
sampler = TraceIdRatioBased(0.5)
tracer_provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource, sampler=sampler)
```

### Choosing a Different Exporter

OpenTelemetry supports various exporters, including:

*   **Jaeger:**  As demonstrated in this guide.
*   **Zipkin:** Another popular open-source distributed tracing system.
*   **Prometheus:**  While primarily used for metrics, it can also be used to export trace data using the OTLP protocol.
*   **OTLP:**  OpenTelemetry Protocol, a standardized protocol for exporting telemetry data.  Many observability platforms support OTLP.

To use a different exporter, you need to install the corresponding package and configure the exporter in `instrumentation.py`.  For example, to use the Zipkin exporter:

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin
```

And in `instrumentation.py`:

```python
from opentelemetry.exporter.zipkin.json import ZipkinExporter

zipkin_exporter = ZipkinExporter(
    base_url="http://localhost:9411",  # Zipkin instance URL
)

span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(zipkin_exporter)
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)
```

You will also need to run a Zipkin instance, for example using docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

## Best Practices

*   **Use meaningful span names:**  Choose span names that accurately reflect the operations being performed.
*   **Add relevant attributes:**  Include attributes that provide additional context about the operations, such as request parameters, user IDs, and database query information.
*   **Propagate context:** Ensure that tracing context is propagated across service boundaries to correlate traces.
*   **Sample traces in production:**  Use sampling to reduce the volume of data being collected in production environments.
*   **Choose the right exporter:**  Select an exporter that integrates well with your observability backend.
*   **Regularly review your instrumentation:** As your application evolves, regularly review your instrumentation to ensure that it is still providing the information you need.
*   **Consider using an agent (e.g., OpenTelemetry Collector):** For more complex deployments, consider using an OpenTelemetry Collector to aggregate and process telemetry data before sending it to your observability backend. This can improve performance and reduce the load on your application.
