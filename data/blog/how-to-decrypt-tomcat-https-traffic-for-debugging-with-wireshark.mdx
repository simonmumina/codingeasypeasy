# Decrypting Tomcat HTTPS Traffic for Debugging with Wireshark

Debugging HTTPS traffic can be challenging because the data is encrypted. Luckily, tools like Wireshark, coupled with some clever configuration, allow us to decrypt this traffic and inspect the actual data being transmitted. This guide will walk you through the steps to decrypt HTTPS traffic originating from your Apache Tomcat server using Wireshark.

## Why Decrypt HTTPS Traffic?

While HTTPS provides essential security and privacy, it can be a headache during development and debugging. Here are a few scenarios where decrypting HTTPS traffic is beneficial:

- **API Integration:** Troubleshooting issues with API calls. Understanding the request and response payloads can pinpoint problems related to data serialization, incorrect parameters, or unexpected errors.
- **Authentication Issues:** Debugging authentication and authorization problems. Seeing the actual tokens and credentials being exchanged can help identify problems with token generation, validation, or revocation.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Identifying performance bottlenecks. Analyzing the size and content of requests and responses can reveal inefficiencies in data transfer.
- **Security Audits:** Conducting security audits. While you shouldn't routinely decrypt production traffic, doing so in a controlled testing environment can help you identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Apache Tomcat:** A running Tomcat server configured with HTTPS.
- **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer installed on your machine. You can download it from [www.wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/).
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Installed and configured on your system. You'll need this for creating the necessary Java security properties file.
- **Access to Tomcat's Keystore:** You'll need the keystore file containing the server's private key and password.

## Steps to Decrypt Tomcat HTTPS Traffic

### 1. Configure Tomcat for Key Logging

The first step is to tell Tomcat to log the SSL/TLS session keys. Wireshark will use these keys to decrypt the traffic. There are two main approaches: using the `javax.net.debug` system property or using a more specific `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable. We'll focus on the environment variable method as it's generally more targeted and doesn't produce overly verbose debugging output from Tomcat itself.

**a. Setting the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` Environment Variable**

This is the recommended method. Set the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable _before_ starting Tomcat. This tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to log the session keys.

- **Linux/macOS:**

  ```plaintext
  export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/path/to/sslkeylog.log
  ```

  Modify your Tomcat startup script (e.g., `catalina.sh`) to include this line _before_ the `java` command that starts Tomcat. For example:

  ```plaintext
  #!/bin/sh
  # ... other stuff in catalina.sh
  export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/path/to/sslkeylog.log
  exec "$_RUNJAVA" "$LOGGING_CONFIG" $CLASSNAME "$@" start
  ```

- **Windows:**

  You can set the environment variable in the System Properties:

  1.  Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties".
  2.  Click on "Advanced system settings".
  3.  Click on "Environment Variables...".
  4.  Under "System variables", click "New...".
  5.  Enter `SSLKEYLOGFILE` for the Variable name and `/path/to/sslkeylog.log` for the Variable value.
  6.  Restart Tomcat.

  Alternatively, you can set it in the `catalina.bat` file, similar to the Linux/macOS approach. Make sure to use Windows-style paths:

  ```plaintext
  set SSLKEYLOGFILE=C:\path\to\sslkeylog.log
  ```

**Important:** Replace `/path/to/sslkeylog.log` (or `C:\path\to\sslkeylog.log`) with the actual path to the file where you want the session keys to be logged. Ensure that the Tomcat process has write access to this file.

**b. Restart Tomcat**

After setting the environment variable, **restart your Tomcat server** for the changes to take effect.

### 2. Capture Traffic with Wireshark

Now, start Wireshark and begin capturing traffic on the network interface that Tomcat is using. Typically, this will be your main network interface.

1.  **Select the Correct Interface:** In Wireshark, choose the correct network interface from which to capture traffic.
2.  **Apply a Filter (Optional):** To reduce the amount of data captured and make analysis easier, you can apply a filter to only capture traffic to and from your Tomcat server. For example, if your Tomcat server's IP address is `192.168.1.100` and it's running on port `8443`, you can use the following filter:

    ```wireshark
    ip.addr == 192.168.1.100 && tcp.port == 8443
    ```

3.  **Start Capturing:** Click the "Start capturing packets" button (the shark fin icon).

### 3. Configure Wireshark to Use the SSL Key Log File

Next, you need to tell Wireshark to use the SSL key log file generated by Tomcat.

1.  **Open Wireshark Preferences:** Go to "Edit" -> "Preferences".
2.  **Navigate to Protocols:** In the Preferences dialog, expand "Protocols" and scroll down to "TLS". (Older versions of Wireshark might call this "SSL" instead of "TLS").
3.  **Specify the SSL Key Log File:** In the "TLS" preferences, locate the " (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename" field. Enter the path to the `sslkeylog.log` file you specified earlier.

4.  **Click "OK":** Save the Wireshark preferences.

### 4. Trigger HTTPS Traffic

Now, interact with your Tomcat server by sending HTTPS requests. Make sure to trigger enough traffic to generate sufficient data for analysis. Use a browser, `curl`, or any other client application to send requests to your Tomcat server over HTTPS.

### 5. Observe Decrypted Traffic in Wireshark

Wireshark should now be able to decrypt the HTTPS traffic. Look for the following indicators:

- **Decrypted Packets:** Select an HTTPS packet in Wireshark's packet list. In the packet details pane, you should see the decrypted application data (e.g., HTTP headers, HTML content, API responses). The protocol should be correctly identified (e.g., HTTP instead of just TLS).
- **"Decrypted TLS record" Message:** Some packets might display the message "Decrypted TLS record". This indicates that Wireshark has successfully decrypted the data within that packet.
- **Follow TCP Stream:** Right-click on a decrypted packet and select "Follow" -> "TCP Stream". This will display the entire TCP conversation, with the decrypted data clearly visible.

If you don't see decrypted traffic, double-check the following:

- **SSL Key Log File Path:** Ensure the path to the `sslkeylog.log` file in Wireshark's preferences is correct.
- **Tomcat Restart:** Make sure you restarted Tomcat _after_ setting the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable.
- **File Permissions:** Verify that the Tomcat process has write access to the `sslkeylog.log` file.
- **Wireshark Restart:** In some cases, restarting Wireshark after configuring the key log file can help.
- **Valid SSL/TLS Handshake:** Ensure that a proper SSL/TLS handshake has occurred between the client and server before the data you're trying to decrypt is sent. The session keys needed for decryption are negotiated during the handshake. If the handshake fails for some reason, Wireshark won't be able to decrypt the traffic.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **"Unknown Record" or "Malformed Packet" Errors:** These errors often indicate that Wireshark is not able to decrypt the traffic. This can be due to an incorrect SSL key log file path, an improperly configured Tomcat server, or a problem with the SSL/TLS handshake.
- **No Decryption After Configuration:** Double-check the environment variable is set correctly, the Tomcat server is restarted, and the Wireshark configuration is accurate. Try restarting both Tomcat and Wireshark. Also, check for file permissions on the key log file.
- **Intermittent Decryption:** Session keys are often renegotiated during long-lived connections. If you're only seeing decryption for part of a conversation, it might be due to key renegotiation. Ensure that your `sslkeylog.log` file is being continuously updated.

## Alternative Method: Using `javax.net.debug` (Less Recommended)

While using `SSLKEYLOGFILE` is the preferred method, you can also enable more verbose SSL debugging in Tomcat using the `javax.net.debug` system property. This approach generates a lot of output and should be used with caution, especially in production-like environments.

To enable it, add the following option to the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable _before_ starting Tomcat:

```plaintext
export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake"
```

or

```plaintext
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake
```

This will print detailed SSL handshake information to the Tomcat console. While you won't get a dedicated key log file, this output can be helpful for diagnosing SSL/TLS-related problems. You can then manually extract the pre-master secret from the console output and use it in Wireshark (although this is a manual and cumbersome process).

## Security Considerations

- **Never Decrypt Production Traffic Without Authorization:** Decrypting production traffic raises serious privacy and security concerns. Obtain proper authorization before attempting to decrypt any traffic that may contain sensitive data.
- **Protect the SSL Key Log File:** The `sslkeylog.log` file contains sensitive information. Protect it with appropriate file permissions and delete it when you are finished debugging.
- **Use in Development/Testing Environments Only:** Decryption is primarily a debugging tool for development and testing environments. Avoid enabling it in production environments unless absolutely necessary and with appropriate safeguards.
- **Rotation of Keys:** Understand how often your TLS keys are rotated. If key rotation is frequent, you may need to continuously update your `sslkeylog.log` file and reload it into Wireshark to maintain decryption capabilities.

## Conclusion

Decrypting HTTPS traffic can be a powerful debugging technique for understanding and resolving issues with your Tomcat server and its communication with clients. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively use Wireshark to analyze encrypted traffic and gain valuable insights into your application's behavior. Remember to prioritize security and privacy and only decrypt traffic in controlled environments with proper authorization.
