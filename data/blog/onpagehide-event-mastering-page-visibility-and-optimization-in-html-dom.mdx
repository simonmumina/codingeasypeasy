# Onpagehide Event: Mastering Page Visibility and Optimization in HTML DOM

In the realm of web development, understanding how browsers manage page visibility and lifecycle is crucial for building efficient and user-friendly applications. One particularly important event in the HTML DOM is the `onpagehide` event. This event provides a mechanism for developers to respond when a page is being hidden, allowing for tasks like saving state, releasing resources, or performing cleanup operations. This blog post provides a detailed exploration of the `onpagehide` event, comparing it to related events, and showcasing practical examples of its usage.

## What is the `onpagehide` Event?

The `onpagehide` event is fired on the `window` object of a document when a page is being hidden from the user. This can occur in several scenarios:

- **Navigating away from the page:** When the user clicks a link, enters a new URL in the address bar, or uses the browser's back/forward buttons.
- **Closing the browser tab or window:** As the user closes the tab or window containing the webpage.
- **Refreshing the page (in some cases):** Depending on the browser and the refresh method (e.g., soft reload vs. hard reload).
- **The page being moved to the background:** In mobile environments or when switching between applications.

The key characteristic of `onpagehide` is that it signals a _potential_ for the page to be reused in the future. This is crucial because browsers often implement a "back-forward cache" (bfcache) to improve navigation speed. The bfcache stores a snapshot of the page's state, allowing it to be instantly restored when the user navigates back.

## How `onpagehide` Differs from `onunload`

It's essential to distinguish `onpagehide` from the older `onunload` event. While both events fire when a page is being unloaded, their purposes and behaviors differ significantly:

- **`onunload`:** This event is triggered when the browser is completely unloading the page. This usually means the page is being removed from memory and will not be reused. Historically, `onunload` was often used for cleanup tasks, but its reliability has been compromised by browser optimizations. Modern best practices discourage relying heavily on `onunload`.

- **`onpagehide`:** This event is triggered when the page is being _hidden_ but might be restored later. The page instance and its associated JavaScript context may be kept alive in the bfcache. `onpagehide` is the preferred event for cleanup tasks related to page visibility, as it allows you to handle both bfcache scenarios and complete page unloads.

**Why `onunload` is Problematic:**

- **Unreliable:** Browsers often optimize page loading and unloading for performance. This can lead to `onunload` not firing reliably, especially in modern single-page applications (SPAs) or on mobile devices.
- **Hindrance to Bfcache:** Using `onunload` can prevent the browser from using the bfcache. Browsers are often wary of caching pages that have `onunload` handlers because they might need to execute code during the bfcache restore, potentially causing issues.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature     | `onunload`                        | `onpagehide`                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose     | Page is being completely unloaded | Page is being hidden (may be restored)     |
| Bfcache     | Prevents bfcache usage (often)    | Designed for bfcache awareness             |
| Reliability | Less reliable                     | More reliable for visibility changes       |
| Use Cases   | Generally discouraged.            | Saving state, releasing resources, cleanup |

## Detecting Bfcache with the `persisted` Property

The `onpagehide` event provides an `Event` object with a `persisted` property. This boolean property indicates whether the page is being hidden _into_ the bfcache or not. If `persisted` is `true`, it means the page is being cached and may be restored later. If `persisted` is `false`, it means the page is likely being completely unloaded.

```plaintext
window.addEventListener('pagehide', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
    console.log("Page is being hidden into bfcache.");
    // Perform actions specific to bfcache caching
  } else {
    console.log("Page is being unloaded (not cached).");
    // Perform actions specific to a full unload
  }
});
```

This allows you to tailor your handling of the event based on whether the page is going into the bfcache or not.

## Practical Examples of Using `onpagehide`

Here are some common scenarios where the `onpagehide` event can be beneficial:

**1. Saving User Input:**

If a user is filling out a form and navigates away before submitting, you can use `onpagehide` to save the form data in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to avoid data loss.

```plaintext
window.addEventListener('pagehide', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
    // Save form data to localStorage
    const formData = {
      name: document.getElementById('name').value,
      email: document.getElementById('email').value,
      message: document.getElementById('message').value
    };
    localStorage.setItem('formData', JSON.stringify(formData));
  }
});

// On page load, check for saved data and restore it
window.addEventListener('pageshow', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
    const savedFormData = localStorage.getItem('formData');
    if (savedFormData) {
      const formData = JSON.parse(savedFormData);
      document.getElementById('name').value = formData.name;
      document.getElementById('email').value = formData.email;
      document.getElementById('message').value = formData.message;
      localStorage.removeItem('formData'); // Clean up after restoring
    }
  }
});
```

**2. Releasing Resources:**

If your page uses resources like timers, event listeners, or WebSocket connections, you can use `onpagehide` to release them when the page is hidden, preventing memory leaks and improving performance.

```plaintext
let timerId;
let websocket;

function startResources() {
  timerId = setInterval(function() {
    console.log("Timer running...");
  }, 1000);

  websocket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/socket');
  websocket.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log("Received message: " + event.data);
  };
}

function stopResources() {
  clearInterval(timerId);
  timerId = null;

  if (websocket) {
    websocket.close();
    websocket = null;
  }
}

startResources(); // Start resources when the page loads

window.addEventListener('pagehide', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
    console.log("Releasing resources (bfcache).");
    stopResources();
  } else {
    console.log("Releasing resources (full unload).");
    stopResources();
  }
});

window.addEventListener('pageshow', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
    console.log("Restoring resources from bfcache.");
    startResources();
  }
});

```

**3. Stopping Animations or Sound:**

If your page has animations or sounds playing, you can use `onpagehide` to pause them when the page is hidden and resume them when the page is shown again (using `pageshow` event). This prevents unnecessary resource consumption.

```plaintext
let animationFrameId;

function startAnimation() {
  function animate() {
    // Animation logic here
    console.log("Animation frame...");
    animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }
  animate();
}

function stopAnimation() {
  cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameId);
  animationFrameId = null;
}

startAnimation();

window.addEventListener('pagehide', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
     console.log("Pausing animation (bfcache)");
     stopAnimation();
  } else {
      console.log("Pausing animation (full unload)");
      stopAnimation();
  }
});

window.addEventListener('pageshow', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
    console.log("Resuming animation (bfcache)");
    startAnimation();
  }
});

```

**4. Implementing Offline Functionality:**

Using the `onpagehide` and `pageshow` events in conjunction with Service Workers allows you to create powerful offline experiences. You can store data in the bfcache and use Service Workers to intercept network requests and provide cached content when the user is offline.

## The `pageshow` Event

The `pageshow` event is the counterpart to `onpagehide`. It fires when the page is shown, either after being restored from the bfcache or after a normal page load. The `pageshow` event also has a `persisted` property, allowing you to determine if the page was restored from the bfcache.

```plaintext
window.addEventListener('pageshow', function(event) {
  if (event.persisted) {
    console.log("Page restored from bfcache.");
    // Perform actions specific to bfcache restoration
  } else {
    console.log("Page loaded normally.");
    // Perform actions for a normal page load
  }
});
```

## Best Practices for Using `onpagehide`

- **Use `onpagehide` for visibility-related cleanup:** This is the primary purpose of the event. Use it to save state, release resources, and pause activities when the page is hidden.
- **Check the `persisted` property:** Use `event.persisted` to differentiate between bfcache scenarios and full page unloads. This allows you to tailor your code accordingly.
- **Use `pageshow` for restoration:** Use `pageshow` to restore the page's state when it is shown again, especially when it comes from the bfcache.
- **Avoid long-running tasks:** The `onpagehide` event handler should execute quickly to avoid blocking the bfcache or delaying the page unload.
- **Test thoroughly:** Test your code in different browsers and scenarios to ensure it works correctly. Pay particular attention to bfcache behavior.
- **Consider alternatives for long-term persistence:** For data that needs to persist beyond the bfcache, consider using server-side storage or more persistent client-side storage options like IndexedDB.

## Conclusion

The `onpagehide` event is a valuable tool for web developers who want to optimize their websites for performance and user experience. By understanding how it works, how it differs from `onunload`, and how to use it effectively, you can create applications that are more responsive, efficient, and resilient to page visibility changes. Mastering the `onpagehide` event helps create a smoother and more enjoyable web browsing experience for your users. Don't forget to leverage the power of the `persisted` property and the `pageshow` event to handle bfcache scenarios correctly.
