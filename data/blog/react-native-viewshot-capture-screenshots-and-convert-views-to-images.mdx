# React Native ViewShot: Capture Screenshots and Convert Views to Images

In the world of React Native development, capturing screenshots or converting specific components into images is a common requirement. Whether you need to generate shareable content, enable user feedback with annotated screenshots, or perform image analysis within your app, the `react-native-view-shot` library provides a powerful and flexible solution. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the installation, usage, and advanced features of `react-native-view-shot`, equipping you with the knowledge to seamlessly integrate image capture capabilities into your React Native applications.

## What is `react-native-view-shot`?

`react-native-view-shot` is a React Native library that allows you to capture the visual representation of a specific React Native view as an image. It essentially takes a "snapshot" of a component and provides you with various options for saving, displaying, or processing the resulting image data. It offers several advantages:

- **Simple API:** The library provides a straightforward and easy-to-use API, making it simple to integrate image capture functionality into your components.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** It works seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring consistent behavior across your target devices.
- **Customizable Output:** You can configure the output format (JPEG, PNG), quality, and image size to meet your specific requirements.
- **Flexible Usage:** It allows you to either save the image to the device's file system or obtain the image data as a base64 encoded string.

## Installation

Before you can start using `react-native-view-shot`, you need to install it in your React Native project. Follow these steps:

1.  **Install the package:**

    ```plaintext
    npm install react-native-view-shot
    # or
    yarn add react-native-view-shot
    ```

2.  **Link native modules (for React Native versions < 0.60):**

    If you're using a React Native version older than 0.60, you'll need to manually link the native modules. For newer versions, autolinking should handle this automatically.

    ```plaintext
    react-native link react-native-view-shot
    ```

3.  **iOS Pod Installation:**

    For iOS projects, navigate to your `ios` directory and run `pod install`:

    ```plaintext
    cd ios
    pod install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Permissions:**

    On both iOS and Android, you might need to request permissions to write to the device's storage if you intend to save the captured image to the file system. This is typically done using libraries like `react-native-permissions`.

    **Example using `react-native-permissions`:**

    ```javascript
    import { check, request, PERMISSIONS, RESULTS } from 'react-native-permissions'

    const checkStoragePermission = async () => {
      try {
        let permission
        if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
          permission = PERMISSIONS.IOS.PHOTO_LIBRARY
        } else {
          permission = PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
        }

        const result = await check(permission)

        if (result === RESULTS.GRANTED) {
          console.log('Storage permission already granted')
          return true
        } else {
          const requestResult = await request(permission)
          if (requestResult === RESULTS.GRANTED) {
            console.log('Storage permission granted')
            return true
          } else {
            console.log('Storage permission denied')
            return false
          }
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error checking/requesting storage permission:', error)
        return false
      }
    }
    ```

## Basic Usage

Now that you have `react-native-view-shot` installed and linked, let's explore the basic usage.

1.  **Import the `captureRef` function:**

    ```javascript
    import { captureRef } from 'react-native-view-shot'
    import React, { useRef } from 'react'
    import { View, Button, Image, StyleSheet, Platform } from 'react-native'
    import { check, request, PERMISSIONS, RESULTS } from 'react-native-permissions'
    ```

2.  **Create a reference to the view you want to capture:**

    Use `useRef` to create a reference to the component you want to capture. This allows you to pass a specific view to `captureRef`.

    ```javascript
    const MyComponent = () => {
      const viewRef = useRef(null)
      // ...
    }
    ```

3.  **Call `captureRef` to capture the view:**

    Within a function (e.g., a button press handler), call `captureRef` with the view reference. `captureRef` returns a Promise that resolves with the image URI or base64 data, depending on your configuration.

    ```javascript
    const MyComponent = () => {
      const viewRef = useRef(null)
      const [imageUri, setImageUri] = React.useState(null)

      const checkStoragePermission = async () => {
        try {
          let permission
          if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
            permission = PERMISSIONS.IOS.PHOTO_LIBRARY
          } else {
            permission = PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
          }

          const result = await check(permission)

          if (result === RESULTS.GRANTED) {
            console.log('Storage permission already granted')
            return true
          } else {
            const requestResult = await request(permission)
            if (requestResult === RESULTS.GRANTED) {
              console.log('Storage permission granted')
              return true
            } else {
              console.log('Storage permission denied')
              return false
            }
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error checking/requesting storage permission:', error)
          return false
        }
      }

      const captureView = async () => {
        const hasPermission = await checkStoragePermission()

        if (!hasPermission) {
          alert('Storage permission required to save images!')
          return
        }

        try {
          const uri = await captureRef(viewRef, {
            format: 'png',
            quality: 0.9,
            result: 'tmpfile', // or 'base64'
          })
          console.log('Image saved to', uri)
          setImageUri(uri)
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error capturing view:', error)
        }
      }

      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <View style={styles.content} ref={viewRef}>
            <Text>This is the content to be captured!</Text>
            <Button title="Click Me!" onPress={() => alert('You clicked the button!')} />
          </View>
          <Button title="Capture View" onPress={captureView} />
          {imageUri && <Image source={{ uri: imageUri }} style={styles.image} />}
        </View>
      )
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
      },
      content: {
        backgroundColor: '#eee',
        padding: 20,
        margin: 10,
        borderRadius: 5,
      },
      image: {
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        marginTop: 20,
      },
    })
    ```

## Configuration Options

The `captureRef` function accepts an optional configuration object that allows you to customize the capture process:

- **`format`**: The image format (`'png'` or `'jpg'`). Defaults to `'png'`.
- **`quality`**: The image quality (a number between 0 and 1). Only applies to JPEG images. Defaults to `0.9`.
- **`result`**: Specifies how the result should be returned:
  - `'tmpfile'`: Saves the image to a temporary file and returns the file URI.
  - `'base64'`: Returns the image data as a base64 encoded string.
  - `'data-uri'`: Returns the image data as a data URI (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,...`).
    Defaults to `'tmpfile'`.
- **`snapshotContentContainer`**: (iOS only) If set to `true`, the library will render the `contentContainer` of the view being captured. This can be helpful when capturing ScrollView or FlatList components. Defaults to `false`.
- **`width`**: The desired width of the captured image (in pixels). If not specified, the original width of the view is used.
- **`height`**: The desired height of the captured image (in pixels). If not specified, the original height of the view is used.
- **`overlayColor`**: A color to use as an overlay. Useful for capturing translucent views correctly.
- **`crop`**: (iOS only) Whether to crop the captured image. Defaults to `true`.

**Example with different options:**

```javascript
const captureView = async () => {
  const hasPermission = await checkStoragePermission()

  if (!hasPermission) {
    alert('Storage permission required to save images!')
    return
  }
  try {
    const base64Data = await captureRef(viewRef, {
      format: 'jpg',
      quality: 0.7,
      result: 'base64',
      width: 300,
      height: 200,
    })
    console.log('Base64 image data:', base64Data)
    setImageUri(`data:image/jpg;base64,${base64Data}`) // Use data URI for direct display
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error capturing view:', error)
  }
}
```

## Capturing ScrollView or FlatList Content

Capturing the entire content of a `ScrollView` or `FlatList` can be tricky because only the visible portion is rendered by default. The `snapshotContentContainer` option (iOS only) can help with this:

```javascript
// iOS only!
const captureScrollView = async () => {
  const hasPermission = await checkStoragePermission()

  if (!hasPermission) {
    alert('Storage permission required to save images!')
    return
  }
  try {
    const uri = await captureRef(scrollViewRef, {
      format: 'png',
      quality: 0.9,
      result: 'tmpfile',
      snapshotContentContainer: true, // Important for ScrollView!
    })
    console.log('ScrollView captured to', uri)
    setImageUri(uri)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error capturing ScrollView:', error)
  }
}
```

**Important Considerations for ScrollView/FlatList:**

- **Performance:** Capturing large `ScrollView` or `FlatList` content can be resource-intensive. Consider optimizing your content and using pagination techniques if necessary.
- **`snapshotContentContainer` is iOS only:** This option is not available on Android. For Android, capturing the full content of a scrollable view often requires a different approach, potentially involving rendering the entire content off-screen.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues:** Ensure that you have requested and obtained the necessary storage permissions on both iOS and Android.

- **Blank Images:** If you're getting blank images, double-check that the view you are trying to capture is fully rendered before calling `captureRef`. You might need to use `setTimeout` or listen for a layout event to ensure the view is ready. Also, ensure your `viewRef` is correctly attached to a view.

- **iOS `snapshotContentContainer` not working:** Ensure the `ScrollView` or `FlatList` is correctly laid out and its content size is properly calculated. Incorrect content sizing can lead to incomplete captures.

- **Android: Black Screen Issues:** Certain Android devices and emulators may have issues related to hardware acceleration. Try disabling hardware acceleration in your emulator settings or on the device itself (if possible). Alternatively, try capturing to `base64` instead of saving to a file, as this can sometimes bypass rendering issues.

- **React Native Reanimated:** If you are using React Native Reanimated, ensure the view you are trying to capture is not animated at the moment of capture. Animated views may produce unexpected results.

## Advanced Usage

- **Image Processing:** After capturing the image, you can use other libraries, such as `react-native-image-editor`, to further process the image (e.g., cropping, rotating, adding filters).

- **Saving to Camera Roll:** Use libraries like `react-native-cameraroll` to save the captured image directly to the device's camera roll or photo library.

- **Sharing Images:** Integrate with sharing libraries like `react-native-share` to allow users to easily share the captured images with others.

## Example: Saving to Camera Roll and Sharing

```javascript
import { captureRef } from 'react-native-view-shot'
import CameraRoll from '@react-native-community/cameraroll'
import Share from 'react-native-share'

const captureAndShare = async () => {
  const hasPermission = await checkStoragePermission()

  if (!hasPermission) {
    alert('Storage permission required to save images!')
    return
  }
  try {
    const uri = await captureRef(viewRef, {
      format: 'png',
      quality: 0.9,
      result: 'tmpfile',
    })

    // Save to Camera Roll
    await CameraRoll.save(uri, { type: 'photo', album: 'MyAppScreenshots' })
    console.log('Image saved to Camera Roll')

    // Share the image
    const shareOptions = {
      title: 'Share via',
      message: 'Check out this awesome screenshot!',
      url: `file://${uri}`, // Important: Use file:// for local URIs
      type: 'image/png',
    }

    await Share.open(shareOptions)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error capturing, saving, or sharing:', error)
  }
}
```

**Important Notes for Sharing:**

- **`file://` protocol:** When sharing images from a local URI (obtained with `result: 'tmpfile'`), make sure to prepend `file://` to the URI when using `react-native-share`. This is required for the sharing intent to correctly access the image.
- **iOS `info.plist`:** On iOS, you might need to add the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` key to your `info.plist` file to request permission to access the photo library.
