# Disable Tomcat Server Info Exposure: Enhance Security and Protect Your Web Server

Exposing the version and build details of your Apache Tomcat server can provide valuable information to attackers, potentially making it easier for them to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities. This blog post will guide you through the steps to disable Tomcat server info exposure, significantly enhancing the security of your web server and reducing your attack surface.

## Why Disable Tomcat Server Info Exposure?

By default, Tomcat displays information about its version and operating system in error pages and HTTP response headers. This information, while seemingly benign, can be used by malicious actors to:

- **Identify Known Vulnerabilities:** Knowing the exact Tomcat version allows attackers to quickly determine if your server is vulnerable to specific exploits.
- **Target Specific Attacks:** Version information can help attackers tailor their attacks to the specific configuration and features of your Tomcat installation.
- **Information Gathering:** Exposing server details provides attackers with a valuable piece of the puzzle when mapping out your infrastructure.

Disabling this exposure significantly increases the difficulty for attackers to identify and target your server.

## Methods to Disable Tomcat Server Info Exposure

There are several ways to disable Tomcat server info exposure. We'll cover the most common and effective methods:

1.  **Modifying the `serverInfo` Attribute in `server.xml`**
2.  **Custom Error Pages**
3.  **Using a `RequestFilter`**
4.  **Modifying Tomcat's Internal Classes (Not Recommended)**

Let's explore each method in detail.

### 1. Modifying the `serverInfo` Attribute in `server.xml`

This is the most straightforward and recommended approach. You can directly modify the `server.xml` file to change the server information that Tomcat exposes.

- **Locate `server.xml`:** The `server.xml` file is typically located in the `conf` directory of your Tomcat installation. For example: `/opt/tomcat/conf/server.xml`.

- **Edit `server.xml`:** Open the `server.xml` file using a text editor with administrative privileges.

- **Find the `<Server>` element:** Locate the `<Server>` element in the file. It should look something like this:

  ```plaintext
  <Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
    ...
  </Server>
  ```

- **Add or Modify the `serverInfo` attribute:** Add or modify the `serverInfo` attribute within the `<Server>` element. Set the value to a generic string that doesn't reveal specific version information.

  ```plaintext
  <Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN" serverInfo="My Custom Server">
    ...
  </Server>
  ```

  Or even better, an empty string:

  ```plaintext
  <Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN" serverInfo="">
    ...
  </Server>
  ```

- **Save the changes:** Save the `server.xml` file.

- **Restart Tomcat:** Restart your Tomcat server for the changes to take effect.

  ```plaintext
  sudo systemctl restart tomcat
  ```

- **Verify the change:** After restarting, send a request to your server that would normally trigger an error page (e.g., request a non-existent resource). Inspect the HTTP response headers. The `Server` header should now reflect the `serverInfo` value you set (or be absent if you used an empty string).

### 2. Custom Error Pages

Tomcat displays error pages when requests cannot be processed. These pages often include server version information. By creating custom error pages, you can prevent this information from being exposed.

- **Create Custom Error Pages:** Create HTML files for common HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500, 503). These files should not contain any server-specific information. Place these files in a directory within your web application (e.g., `/error`). For example:

  ```plaintext
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Error 404 - Not Found</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Error 404 - Not Found</h1>
      <p>The requested resource could not be found.</p>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

- **Configure `web.xml`:** Modify the `web.xml` file of your web application to map specific error codes to your custom error pages. The `web.xml` file is usually located in the `WEB-INF` directory of your web application.

  ```plaintext
  <web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
                               http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd"
           version="4.0">

      <error-page>
          <error-code>404</error-code>
          <location>/error/404.html</location>
      </error-page>

      <error-page>
          <error-code>500</error-code>
          <location>/error/500.html</location>
      </error-page>

      <error-page>
          <error-exception>java.lang.Exception</error-exception>
          <location>/error/500.html</location>
      </error-page>

  </web-app>
  ```

  This configuration tells Tomcat to display `404.html` when a 404 error occurs and `500.html` when a 500 error occurs or an unhandled `java.lang.Exception` is thrown.

- **Restart your web application or Tomcat:** Restart your web application or the entire Tomcat server for the changes to take effect.

- **Verify the change:** Test by accessing a non-existent resource and triggering a 404 error. Verify that your custom error page is displayed without any server version information.

### 3. Using a `RequestFilter`

A `RequestFilter` can intercept all incoming requests and modify the response headers to remove or alter the `Server` header. This provides a more dynamic and centralized way to control server info exposure.

- **Create a Filter Class:** Create a Java class that implements the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface. This class will modify the response headers.

  ```plaintext
  import javax.servlet.*;
  import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
  import java.io.IOException;

  public class ServerInfoFilter implements Filter {

      @Override
      public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
          // Initialization code (optional)
      }

      @Override
      public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
          HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) response;
          httpResponse.setHeader("Server", "My Custom Server"); // Or remove the header entirely: httpResponse.setHeader("Server", null); or httpResponse.setHeader("Server", "");

          chain.doFilter(request, response);
      }

      @Override
      public void destroy() {
          // Cleanup code (optional)
      }
  }
  ```

- **Compile the Filter:** Compile the Java class into a `.class` file.

- **Package the Filter:** Place the compiled `.class` file into a `.jar` file. This JAR file should be placed in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory of your web application.

- **Configure `web.xml`:** Register the filter in your `web.xml` file.

  ```plaintext
  <web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
                               http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
                               http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd"
           version="4.0">

      <filter>
          <filter-name>ServerInfoFilter</filter-name>
          <filter-class>ServerInfoFilter</filter-class>
      </filter>

      <filter-mapping>
          <filter-name>ServerInfoFilter</filter-name>
          <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
      </filter-mapping>

  </web-app>
  ```

  This configuration maps the `ServerInfoFilter` to all URLs (`/*`), ensuring that it intercepts all requests.

- **Restart your web application or Tomcat:** Restart your web application or the entire Tomcat server for the changes to take effect.

- **Verify the change:** Inspect the HTTP response headers for any request to your web application. The `Server` header should now reflect the value you set in the filter (or be absent if you removed it).

### 4. Modifying Tomcat's Internal Classes (Not Recommended)

This method involves directly modifying Tomcat's internal Java classes. **This is strongly discouraged** because:

- **It's Not Upgrade-Safe:** Any changes you make will likely be overwritten when you upgrade Tomcat.
- **It's Complex:** Modifying internal classes can be complex and prone to errors.
- **It's Difficult to Maintain:** Keeping track of your modifications can be challenging.

However, for completeness, if you absolutely must, you would typically modify the `org.apache.catalina.util.ServerInfo` class. This involves recompiling Tomcat's source code and replacing the existing JAR files, a process that is far more intricate and prone to issues than the previous methods. We **strongly advise against** this approach.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Use a Combination of Methods:** For maximum security, consider using a combination of methods. For example, modify the `serverInfo` attribute in `server.xml` and use a `RequestFilter` to further control header exposure.
- **Regularly Audit your Configuration:** Periodically review your Tomcat configuration to ensure that server info exposure remains disabled.
- **Keep Tomcat Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Tomcat to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor Your Server:** Implement monitoring tools to detect any suspicious activity or attempts to gather server information.

## Conclusion

Disabling Tomcat server info exposure is a crucial step in hardening your web server and protecting it from potential attacks. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can significantly reduce your attack surface and improve your overall security posture. Remember to prioritize the least invasive and most maintainable methods, such as modifying `server.xml` and using `RequestFilters`, and avoid modifying Tomcat's internal classes unless absolutely necessary. Stay vigilant and regularly review your security configuration to ensure your server remains protected.
