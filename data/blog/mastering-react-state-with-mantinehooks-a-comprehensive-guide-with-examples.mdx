# Mastering React State with @mantine/hooks: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

React hooks have revolutionized how we manage state and side effects in functional components. While the built-in React hooks are powerful, libraries like `@mantine/hooks` offer a suite of pre-built, well-tested, and highly optimized hooks that can significantly streamline your development process and improve the performance of your applications.

This comprehensive guide dives deep into `@mantine/hooks`, exploring its core functionalities, providing practical examples, and offering best practices for leveraging these powerful tools in your React projects.

## What is @mantine/hooks?

`@mantine/hooks` is a collection of React hooks designed to simplify common tasks and reduce boilerplate code in your React applications. Developed and maintained by the Mantine UI library team, these hooks are framework-agnostic, meaning you can use them in any React project, regardless of whether you're using the full Mantine UI library. They are highly versatile and can address various development needs, from managing form state to handling asynchronous operations and manipulating the DOM.

## Why Use @mantine/hooks?

Using `@mantine/hooks` offers several advantages:

- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Avoid writing repetitive code for common tasks like managing input state, debouncing functions, or handling media queries.
- **Improved Code Readability:** Hooks encapsulate complex logic, making your components cleaner and easier to understand.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Many `@mantine/hooks` are optimized for performance, minimizing unnecessary re-renders and improving overall application responsiveness.
- **Well-Tested and Maintained:** Backed by the Mantine UI library, these hooks are thoroughly tested and actively maintained, ensuring reliability and stability.
- **Increased Productivity:** Save time and effort by leveraging pre-built hooks for common tasks, allowing you to focus on the core logic of your application.

## Key Hooks in @mantine/hooks and Examples

Let's explore some of the most useful hooks in `@mantine/hooks` and see how they can be applied in practice.

### 1. `useDisclosure`

The `useDisclosure` hook simplifies managing boolean state for visibility toggles, such as modals, dropdowns, and accordions. It provides a clean and concise API for opening, closing, and toggling the state.

```jsx
import { useDisclosure } from '@mantine/hooks'
import { Button, Modal } from '@mantine/core' // Assuming you're using @mantine/core for UI components

function MyComponent() {
  const [opened, { open, close, toggle }] = useDisclosure(false)

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={open}>Open Modal</Button>

      <Modal opened={opened} onClose={close} title="My Modal">
        Modal Content
      </Modal>
    </>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useDisclosure(false)` initializes the state to `false` (closed).
- It returns an array containing the current state (`opened`) and an object with methods:
  - `open()`: Sets the state to `true`.
  - `close()`: Sets the state to `false`.
  - `toggle()`: Toggles the state between `true` and `false`.

### 2. `useInputState`

This hook is perfect for managing the state of input fields in your forms. It provides a simple way to update the input value and reset it to a default value.

```jsx
import { useInputState } from '@mantine/hooks'
import { TextInput, Button } from '@mantine/core'

function MyFormComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useInputState('') // Initial value is an empty string

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        label="Name"
        value={value}
        onChange={(event) => setValue(event.currentTarget.value)}
      />
      <Button onClick={() => setValue('')}>Clear Input</Button>
      <p>Value: {value}</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useInputState('')` initializes the state to an empty string.
- It returns an array containing the current value (`value`) and a function to update it (`setValue`).
- The `onChange` event handler of the `TextInput` component calls `setValue` to update the state based on the input value.

### 3. `useDebouncedValue`

The `useDebouncedValue` hook helps you delay the execution of a function or the updating of a value until a certain amount of time has passed without any further changes. This is particularly useful for handling input fields where you don't want to perform expensive operations on every keystroke.

```jsx
import { useInputState, useDebouncedValue } from '@mantine/hooks'
import { TextInput } from '@mantine/core'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

function SearchComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useInputState('')
  const [debouncedValue] = useDebouncedValue(value, 500) // 500ms debounce delay
  const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an API call based on the debounced value
    if (debouncedValue) {
      // In a real application, you would fetch data from an API here
      setTimeout(() => {
        setSearchResults([`Result for "${debouncedValue}"`])
      }, 500)
    } else {
      setSearchResults([])
    }
  }, [debouncedValue])

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        label="Search"
        value={value}
        onChange={(event) => setValue(event.currentTarget.value)}
      />

      <ul>
        {searchResults.map((result, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{result}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useDebouncedValue(value, 500)` delays updating `debouncedValue` by 500ms.
- The `useEffect` hook only runs when `debouncedValue` changes, preventing unnecessary API calls on every keystroke.

### 4. `useMediaQuery`

This hook allows you to easily detect whether the current screen size matches a specific media query. This is invaluable for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

```jsx
import { useMediaQuery } from '@mantine/hooks'

function ResponsiveComponent() {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)')

  return <div>{isMobile ? <p>Displaying mobile view</p> : <p>Displaying desktop view</p>}</div>
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)')` returns `true` if the screen width is less than or equal to 768px, and `false` otherwise.
- The component renders different content based on the value of `isMobile`.

### 5. `useLocalStorage` and `useSessionStorage`

These hooks provide a simple way to persist data in the browser's local storage or session storage. `useLocalStorage` stores data persistently across browser sessions, while `useSessionStorage` stores data only for the duration of the current session.

```jsx
import { useLocalStorage } from '@mantine/hooks'
import { TextInput } from '@mantine/core'

function LocalStorageExample() {
  const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage({ key: 'name', defaultValue: '' })

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        label="Name"
        value={name}
        onChange={(event) => setName(event.currentTarget.value)}
      />
      <p>Stored Name: {name}</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useLocalStorage({ key: 'name', defaultValue: '' })` stores the value under the key 'name' in local storage. If no value exists, it defaults to an empty string.
- The input's value is bound to the `name` state, and changes are automatically persisted to local storage.

### 6. `useHover`

The `useHover` hook tracks whether an element is currently being hovered over by the mouse. This is useful for adding interactive effects to your components, such as highlighting or displaying tooltips.

```jsx
import { useHover } from '@mantine/hooks'
import { Box } from '@mantine/core'

function HoverableBox() {
  const [hovered, handlers] = useHover()

  return (
    <Box
      {...handlers}
      style={{
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        backgroundColor: hovered ? 'lightblue' : 'white',
        border: '1px solid black',
        cursor: 'pointer',
        display: 'flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}
    >
      Hover Me
    </Box>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useHover()` returns an array containing the hover state (`hovered`) and an object with event handlers (`handlers`).
- The `handlers` object (containing `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave`) are spread onto the `Box` component, which automatically manages the hover state.

### 7. `useClickOutside`

This hook detects clicks outside of a specified element. This is commonly used to close dropdowns, modals, or other interactive elements when the user clicks away from them.

```jsx
import { useClickOutside } from '@mantine/hooks'
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { Button, Box } from '@mantine/core'

function ClickOutsideExample() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
  const ref = useRef(null)

  useClickOutside(ref, () => {
    setIsOpen(false)
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Toggle Dropdown</Button>

      {isOpen && (
        <Box
          ref={ref}
          style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: '40px',
            left: '0',
            backgroundColor: 'white',
            border: '1px solid black',
            padding: '10px',
          }}
        >
          Dropdown Content
        </Box>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useClickOutside(ref, () => setIsOpen(false))` closes the dropdown when a click occurs outside the element referenced by `ref`.
- The `ref` is attached to the dropdown element using `useRef`.

### 8. `useViewportSize`

This hook gives you the current width and height of the viewport. It's essential for creating responsive layouts and adapting your UI to different screen sizes.

```jsx
import { useViewportSize } from '@mantine/hooks'

function ViewportSizeComponent() {
  const { width, height } = useViewportSize()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Viewport Width: {width}px</p>
      <p>Viewport Height: {height}px</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `useViewportSize()` returns an object containing the `width` and `height` of the viewport.
- The component displays the current viewport dimensions.

## Best Practices for Using @mantine/hooks

- **Understand the Purpose:** Before using a hook, make sure you understand its purpose and how it can solve your specific problem.
- **Read the Documentation:** Refer to the official `@mantine/hooks` documentation for detailed information on each hook's API, parameters, and return values.
- **Keep Hooks Reusable:** Try to create reusable hooks that can be shared across multiple components.
- **Test Your Hooks:** Write unit tests to ensure that your hooks are working correctly.
- **Combine Hooks:** Don't be afraid to combine multiple hooks to create more complex and powerful functionality. For example, you could combine `useInputState` and `useDebouncedValue` to create a debounced input field.
- **Avoid Over-Abstraction:** While hooks are great for code reuse, avoid over-abstracting them. If a hook becomes too complex, it might be better to break it down into smaller, more manageable hooks.
