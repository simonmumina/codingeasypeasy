# Deep Linking with Expo Intent Launcher: Opening Native Apps From Your React Native Expo App

Deep linking is a powerful technique that allows your React Native Expo app to interact with other applications installed on the user's device. It enables you to launch specific screens or perform actions within those apps, creating a more integrated and seamless user experience.  While React Native and Expo offer built-in deep linking capabilities, sometimes you need more control and flexibility, especially when dealing with Android Intents. This is where `expo-intent-launcher` comes in.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of using `expo-intent-launcher` to open native applications from your Expo app, covering both Android and iOS considerations. We'll explore the library's features, provide code examples, and discuss best practices to ensure a smooth implementation.

## What is `expo-intent-launcher`?

`expo-intent-launcher` is an Expo module that provides a way to launch intents on Android. Intents are a powerful mechanism in Android that allow applications to communicate with each other and request actions from the system.  Think of them as messages that can be used to start activities, send data, or perform other tasks.  While primarily designed for Android, this guide will also cover the less common use cases for iOS.

**Key benefits of using `expo-intent-launcher`:**

*   **Direct Control over Android Intents:**  Provides fine-grained control over the creation and launching of Android Intents, allowing you to specify actions, categories, data URIs, and other parameters.
*   **Seamless App Integration:** Enables you to launch other apps from your Expo app, enhancing the user experience by connecting your application with other relevant services.
*   **Platform-Specific Functionality:** Addresses the limitations of standard deep linking techniques in specific scenarios, especially on Android.

## Installation

First, install the `expo-intent-launcher` package in your Expo project:

```bash
npx expo install expo-intent-launcher
```

This will install the necessary native dependencies and update your project's `app.json` file. If you're using Expo Go, ensure you update to the latest version for proper compatibility. If you're using a custom development client, rebuild your client after installing the package.

## Basic Usage on Android

The core function of `expo-intent-launcher` is `startActivityAsync`.  This function takes an object containing the intent parameters and attempts to launch the corresponding activity on the user's device.

Here's a simple example that opens the user's default web browser to a specific URL:

```javascript
import * as IntentLauncher from 'expo-intent-launcher';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const openBrowser = async (url: string) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    try {
      await IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync('android.intent.action.VIEW', {
        data: url,
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error opening browser:', e);
    }
  } else {
    // Implement iOS alternative, such as Linking.openURL(url)
    // We will cover iOS alternatives later.
  }
};

// Example usage:
openBrowser('https://www.google.com');
```

**Explanation:**

*   `IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync('android.intent.action.VIEW', { data: url })` creates an intent with the `android.intent.action.VIEW` action, which indicates that we want to view some data.
*   The `data` property specifies the URL we want to open.
*   The `try...catch` block handles potential errors, such as the user not having a web browser installed.
*   We use `Platform.OS === 'android'` to conditionally execute the Android-specific code. Remember to handle the iOS case (explained later).

## More Advanced Android Intent Examples

Let's explore some more advanced use cases for `expo-intent-launcher`.

**1. Opening a Specific App (Package Name)**

To open a specific application directly by its package name, use the `android.intent.action.MAIN` action and specify the package name in the `package` property:

```javascript
import * as IntentLauncher from 'expo-intent-launcher';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const openAppByPackageName = async (packageName: string) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    try {
      await IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync('android.intent.action.MAIN', {
        package: packageName,
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error opening app:', e);
      // Handle the case where the app is not installed.
    }
  } else {
    // iOS alternative may not be possible without custom URL schemes.
    console.log("Opening app by package name is not directly supported on iOS.")
  }
};

// Example usage (attempting to open Google Maps):
openAppByPackageName('com.google.android.apps.maps');
```

**Important:**  This method relies on the app being installed on the device.  You should always include error handling to gracefully handle cases where the app is not found. Consider showing a message to the user suggesting they install the app.

**2. Sending an SMS Message**

You can use `expo-intent-launcher` to pre-populate an SMS message:

```javascript
import * as IntentLauncher from 'expo-intent-launcher';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const sendSMS = async (phoneNumber: string, message: string) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    try {
      await IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync('android.intent.action.SENDTO', {
        data: `smsto:${phoneNumber}`,
        extra: {
          sms_body: message,
        },
        type: 'vnd.android-dir/mms-sms',
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error sending SMS:', e);
    }
  } else {
    // Implement iOS alternative using Linking.openURL
    const url = `sms:${phoneNumber}&body=${message}`;
    Linking.openURL(url).catch(err => console.error('An error occurred', err));
  }
};

// Example usage:
sendSMS('1234567890', 'Hello from my Expo app!');
```

**Explanation:**

*   `android.intent.action.SENDTO` is used to send data to a specific recipient.
*   `data: \`smsto:${phoneNumber}\`` sets the recipient's phone number.
*   `extra: { sms_body: message }` pre-populates the message body.
*   `type: 'vnd.android-dir/mms-sms'` specifies the MIME type for SMS messages.
*   The iOS implementation using `Linking.openURL` provides a cross-platform solution.

**3. Making a Phone Call**

Similarly, you can initiate a phone call using the `android.intent.action.DIAL` action:

```javascript
import * as IntentLauncher from 'expo-intent-launcher';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

const makePhoneCall = async (phoneNumber: string) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    try {
      await IntentLauncher.startActivityAsync('android.intent.action.DIAL', {
        data: `tel:${phoneNumber}`,
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('Error making phone call:', e);
    }
  } else {
    // Implement iOS alternative using Linking.openURL
    Linking.openURL(`tel:${phoneNumber}`).catch(err => console.error('An error occurred', err));
  }
};

// Example usage:
makePhoneCall('5551234567');
```

**Explanation:**

*   `android.intent.action.DIAL` opens the dialer with the specified phone number.
*   `data: \`tel:${phoneNumber}\`` sets the phone number to dial.
*   The iOS implementation using `Linking.openURL` provides a cross-platform solution.

## Handling iOS Alternatives

While `expo-intent-launcher` is primarily designed for Android, it's crucial to provide alternative solutions for iOS to maintain a consistent user experience.  Fortunately, iOS provides the `Linking` API for many common scenarios.

As seen in the SMS and phone call examples above, `Linking.openURL` can be used to achieve similar functionality on iOS.  Here's a more detailed explanation:

*   **`Linking.openURL(url)`:** This method attempts to open the specified URL using the appropriate system handler.  The `url` should be a URL scheme that the system recognizes.

*   **URL Schemes:** iOS uses URL schemes to identify applications that can handle specific types of URLs.  For example:
    *   `tel:`: Opens the dialer.
    *   `sms:`: Opens the SMS app.
    *   `mailto:`: Opens the email app.
    *   Custom URL schemes:  Applications can register their own custom URL schemes, allowing other apps to open them.  This is a common way for apps to provide deep linking capabilities.

**Example: Opening an App Using a Custom URL Scheme (iOS):**

```javascript
import { Platform, Linking } from 'react-native';

const openAppWithCustomScheme = async (urlScheme: string) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
    Linking.canOpenURL(urlScheme)
      .then(supported => {
        if (!supported) {
          console.log("Can't handle url: " + urlScheme);
        } else {
          return Linking.openURL(urlScheme);
        }
      })
      .catch(err => console.error('An error occurred', err));
  } else {
    // Android implementation using expo-intent-launcher (see package name example above)
    console.log("Android implementation using expo-intent-launcher not shown in this example.")
  }
};

// Example Usage (replace with your app's custom URL scheme)
openAppWithCustomScheme('myapp://home');
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Linking.canOpenURL(urlScheme)`: Checks if the system can handle the specified URL scheme.  This is important to prevent errors if the target app is not installed or the URL scheme is not recognized.
*   `Linking.openURL(urlScheme)`: Opens the URL if it is supported.
*   Remember to replace `'myapp://home'` with the actual custom URL scheme of the app you want to open.

**Limitations on iOS:**

Directly launching an application by its bundle identifier (the iOS equivalent of a package name) is **not possible** using standard APIs.  You can only open applications that have registered a custom URL scheme.  This is a security measure to prevent malicious apps from launching other apps without user consent.

## Best Practices

*   **Platform-Specific Code:** Always use `Platform.OS` to conditionally execute code based on the operating system.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where the target app is not installed, the intent fails to launch, or the URL scheme is not supported.
*   **Check for App Availability:** Before attempting to open an app by package name (Android) or custom URL scheme (iOS), use `PackageManager.getPackageInfo` (Android - requires native code) or `Linking.canOpenURL` (iOS) to check if the app is installed and the scheme is supported.
*   **User Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to the user if an attempt to open another app fails.  Consider displaying an error message or suggesting alternative actions.
*   **Security Considerations:** Be mindful of security implications when launching external apps.  Avoid passing sensitive data through intents or URL schemes, as this could potentially be intercepted by malicious apps.
*   **Permissions:** Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to launch intents or open URLs.  On Android, you may need to declare specific intent filters in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to allow your app to handle certain types of intents.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Activity not found" error (Android):** This usually indicates that there is no app on the device that can handle the specified intent.  Double-check the action, data URI, and package name to ensure they are correct.
*   **iOS: `Linking.canOpenURL` returns false:** This means that the system cannot handle the specified URL scheme.  Verify that the target app is installed and that it has registered the URL scheme correctly.
*   **App crashes after launching an intent:** This could be due to a malformed intent or an error in the target app.  Check the Android logcat for more information.
*   **Remember to rebuild your development client (if using one) after installing `expo-intent-launcher`.**
