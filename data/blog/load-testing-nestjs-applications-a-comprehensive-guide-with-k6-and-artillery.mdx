# Load Testing NestJS Applications: A Comprehensive Guide with k6 and Artillery

As your NestJS application grows, ensuring its performance and scalability becomes crucial. Load testing is a vital part of this process.  It simulates real-world traffic to identify potential bottlenecks, performance degradation, and ultimately, ensure your application can handle the expected load. This guide will walk you through load testing your NestJS application using two popular tools: **k6** and **Artillery**.

## Why Load Test NestJS Applications?

Before diving into the how-to, let's quickly recap the benefits of load testing:

*   **Identify Performance Bottlenecks:**  Pinpoint areas in your code or infrastructure that are slowing down your application.
*   **Ensure Scalability:**  Verify that your application can handle increasing user loads without performance degradation.
*   **Prevent Outages:** Proactively identify potential issues that could lead to outages during peak traffic.
*   **Optimize Infrastructure:**  Make informed decisions about infrastructure scaling and resource allocation.
*   **Improve User Experience:**  Ensure a smooth and responsive experience for your users, even under heavy load.
*   **Meet SLAs:** If you have Service Level Agreements (SLAs), load testing helps ensure you meet them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **A NestJS Application:**  You'll need a NestJS application to test.  For this guide, we'll assume you have a simple API endpoint.  If you don't have one, you can quickly create one using the NestJS CLI:

    ```bash
    npm i -g @nestjs/cli
    nest new my-nestjs-app
    cd my-nestjs-app
    ```

    Then, modify the `app.controller.ts` file to include a simple GET endpoint:

    ```typescript
    // src/app.controller.ts
    import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { AppService } from './app.service';

    @Controller()
    export class AppController {
      constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

      @Get()
      getHello(): string {
        return this.appService.getHello();
      }

      @Get('/test')
      getTest(): string {
        return 'This is a test endpoint!';
      }
    }
    ```

    And the `app.service.ts` should look like this:

    ```typescript
    // src/app.service.ts
    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

    @Injectable()
    export class AppService {
      getHello(): string {
        return 'Hello World!';
      }
    }
    ```

    Run your NestJS application using `npm run start:dev`.  It should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

*   **Node.js and npm:**  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
*   **k6:** Install k6 using the instructions on the [k6 website](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).  For example, on macOS using Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install k6
    ```

*   **Artillery:** Install Artillery using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g artillery
    ```

## Load Testing with k6

k6 is a modern load testing tool written in Go and executed in JavaScript. It's known for its ease of use and ability to generate high-load traffic.

### Creating a k6 Test Script

Create a new file named `script.js` (or any name you prefer) in your project directory. This file will contain your k6 test script.

```javascript
// script.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  vus: 10, // Virtual Users
  duration: '10s', // Test duration
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p95<500'], // 95th percentile of request duration should be less than 500ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],   // Error rate should be less than 1%
  },
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('http://localhost:3000/test');
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
  sleep(1); // Simulate user thinking time (1 second)
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`import http from 'k6/http';`**:  Imports the HTTP module for making HTTP requests.
*   **`import { check, sleep } from 'k6';`**: Imports utility functions for checks and sleep.
*   **`options`**:  Defines the test configuration:
    *   **`vus`**:  Number of virtual users to simulate concurrently (10 in this example).
    *   **`duration`**:  Duration of the test (10 seconds in this example).
    *   **`thresholds`**:  Defines performance goals. The test will fail if these thresholds are not met.
        *   **`http_req_duration`**:  Checks that the 95th percentile of request durations is less than 500ms.
        *   **`http_req_failed`**:  Checks that the error rate is less than 1%.
*   **`default function()`**: This is the main function that k6 executes.  It defines what each virtual user will do during the test.
    *   **`http.get('http://localhost:3000/test');`**:  Sends a GET request to your NestJS endpoint.  **Make sure your NestJS application is running!**
    *   **`check(res, { ... });`**:  Performs assertions on the HTTP response. In this case, it checks that the status code is 200.
    *   **`sleep(1);`**:  Simulates user "thinking time" between requests.

### Running the k6 Test

To run the test, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
k6 run script.js
```

k6 will then execute the test and display detailed results in your terminal, including request durations, error rates, and more.  You'll see metrics like:

*   `http_req_duration`:  Min, Max, Average, Median, and 90th/95th percentiles of request durations.
*   `http_req_failed`:  Percentage of failed requests.
*   `http_reqs`:  Number of requests made.
*   `vus`:  Number of virtual users currently active.
*   `vus_max`:  Maximum number of virtual users that were active at any point during the test.

### Interpreting k6 Results

Pay close attention to the following metrics:

*   **`http_req_duration`**:  If the 95th percentile (or other percentile you've defined) exceeds your threshold, it indicates that requests are taking too long.  Investigate potential bottlenecks in your application.
*   **`http_req_failed`**:  A high error rate indicates that something is wrong with your application or infrastructure.  Check your server logs for errors.
*   **`vus_max`**:  This shows the maximum concurrency achieved during the test.
*   **`data_received` and `data_sent`**: These give you an idea of the bandwidth your application is using.

### Advanced k6 Examples

**Using Environment Variables:**

You can use environment variables to configure your test without modifying the script itself.  For example:

```javascript
// script.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

const API_URL = __ENV.API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

export const options = {
  vus: __ENV.VUS || 10,
  duration: __ENV.DURATION || '10s',
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p95<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  const res = http.get(`${API_URL}/test`);
  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
  sleep(1);
}
```

Run the test with:

```bash
API_URL=https://your-production-api.com VUS=50 DURATION=30s k6 run script.js
```

**Using Different Request Methods and Request Bodies:**

```javascript
// script.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '10s',
};

export default function () {
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  });

  const params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  };

  const res = http.post('http://localhost:3000/users', payload, params);

  check(res, {
    'status is 201': (r) => r.status === 201,
  });
}
```

**Reading Data from a CSV file:**

This is useful for simulating users with different data.

```javascript
// script.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';
import { SharedArray } from 'k6/data';
import papaparse from 'https://jslib.k6.io/papaparse/5.1.1/index.js';

const csvData = new SharedArray('users', function() {
  // Load CSV file and parse it using papaparse
  return papaparse.parse(open('./users.csv'), { header: true }).data;
});

export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '10s',
};

export default function () {
  const user = csvData[Math.floor(Math.random() * csvData.length)];
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    username: user.username,
    password: user.password,
  });

  const params = {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  };

  const res = http.post('http://localhost:3000/login', payload, params);

  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
}
```

Create a `users.csv` file like this:

```csv
username,password
user1,password123
user2,securePassword
user3,anotherPassword
```

## Load Testing with Artillery

Artillery is another powerful load testing tool that is well-suited for testing complex application workflows and APIs. It uses YAML files to define test scenarios.

### Creating an Artillery Test Scenario

Create a new file named `artillery.yml` in your project directory.

```yaml
# artillery.yml
config:
  target: 'http://localhost:3000' # Replace with your NestJS application URL
  phases:
    - duration: 10  # Run for 10 seconds
      arrivalRate: 20 # Simulate 20 new virtual users per second
  defaults:
    headers:
      Content-Type: 'application/json'

scenarios:
  - name: 'Test Endpoint'
    flow:
      - get:
          url: '/test'
      - think: 1  # Simulate user thinking time (1 second)
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`config`**: Defines the global configuration for the test.
    *   **`target`**:  The URL of your NestJS application.
    *   **`phases`**: Defines the load profile.  In this case, it simulates 20 new virtual users arriving every second for 10 seconds.
        *   **`duration`**:  The duration of the phase in seconds.
        *   **`arrivalRate`**:  The number of virtual users to start per second.  This creates a gradually increasing load.
    *   **`defaults`**: Defines default headers for all requests.
*   **`scenarios`**:  Defines the test scenarios.  Each scenario represents a user journey.
    *   **`name`**:  A descriptive name for the scenario.
    *   **`flow`**:  An array of actions that the virtual user will perform.
        *   **`get`**:  Sends a GET request.
            *   **`url`**:  The URL to request.
        *   **`think`**:  Pauses execution for a specified amount of time (in seconds), simulating user "thinking time."

### Running the Artillery Test

To run the test, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
artillery run artillery.yml
```

Artillery will execute the test and display real-time metrics in your terminal, including:

*   Requests completed
*   Requests per second
*   Latency (p50, p95, p99)
*   Errors

### Interpreting Artillery Results

Artillery provides a detailed summary report at the end of the test.  Key metrics to watch include:

*   **`rps` (Requests per Second):**  A higher RPS generally indicates better performance.  Monitor how RPS changes as the load increases.
*   **`latency`**:  Pay attention to the P95 and P99 latency values.  These represent the request duration for the 95th and 99th percentiles of requests.  Higher latency indicates slower performance.
*   **`errors`**:  Ideally, you should have zero errors.  Any errors indicate a problem with your application or infrastructure.
*   **`codes`**:  The distribution of HTTP response codes.  You should primarily see 200 OK responses.

### Advanced Artillery Examples

**Using POST Requests with Request Bodies:**

```yaml
# artillery.yml
config:
  target: 'http://localhost:3000'
  phases:
    - duration: 10
      arrivalRate: 20
  defaults:
    headers:
      Content-Type: 'application/json'

scenarios:
  - name: 'Create User'
    flow:
      - post:
          url: '/users'
          json:
            name: 'John Doe'
            email: 'john.doe@example.com'
```

**Using Environment Variables:**

Artillery also supports environment variables, allowing you to configure your tests dynamically.

```yaml
# artillery.yml
config:
  target: '{{ $processEnvironment.API_URL }}'
  phases:
    - duration: 10
      arrivalRate: '{{ $processEnvironment.ARRIVAL_RATE }}'
  defaults:
    headers:
      Content-Type: 'application/json'

scenarios:
  - name: 'Test Endpoint'
    flow:
      - get:
          url: '/test'
```

Run with:

```bash
API_URL=https://your-production-api.com ARRIVAL_RATE=30 artillery run artillery.yml
```

**Chaining Requests and Extracting Data:**

This is useful for testing workflows that involve multiple API calls.

```yaml
# artillery.yml
config:
  target: 'http://localhost:3000'
  phases:
    - duration: 10
      arrivalRate: 20
  defaults:
    headers:
      Content-Type: 'application/json'

scenarios:
  - name: 'Create and Get User'
    flow:
      - post:
          url: '/users'
          json:
            name: 'Jane Doe'
            email: 'jane.doe@example.com'
          capture:
            - json: '$.id' # Assuming the API returns an ID in the response
              as: userId
      - get:
          url: '/users/{{ userId }}'
```

In this example, the `capture` section extracts the `id` from the JSON response of the POST request and stores it in the `userId` variable. This variable is then used in the GET request.

## Best Practices for Load Testing NestJS Applications

*   **Test in a Staging Environment:**  Always load test in a staging environment that mirrors your production environment as closely as possible.  Avoid testing directly in production.
*   **Start with a Baseline:**  Before making any code changes, establish a baseline performance level. This will help you measure the impact of your optimizations.
*   **Gradually Increase the Load:**  Don't immediately bombard your application with a massive amount of traffic.  Start with a small load and gradually increase it to identify the point at which performance degrades.  This is known as **soak testing** or **endurance testing** when performed over a longer period.
*   **Monitor System Resources:**  Use system monitoring tools to track CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network bandwidth during the load test. This can help you identify resource constraints.  Tools like `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, and `iostat` are useful.  Consider using more sophisticated monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
*   **Analyze Logs:**  Check your application logs for errors and warnings during the load test.  These can provide valuable clues about performance bottlenecks.
*   **Test Different Scenarios:**  Test different user workflows and API endpoints to get a comprehensive view of your application's performance.  Think about the most common user actions and prioritize testing those.
*   **Automate Load Testing:**  Integrate load testing into your continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. This will help you catch performance regressions early in the development process.
*   **Consider Realistic User Behavior:**  Try to simulate real-world user behavior as closely as possible.  For example, include "think time" between requests and use realistic data sets.
*   **Database Load Testing:**  Don't forget to load test your database!  Use database-specific load testing tools to simulate database traffic and identify potential bottlenecks. Consider tools like `pgbench` (for PostgreSQL) or `mongodb-stress`.
*   **Caching:**  Implement caching strategies to improve performance.  Test the effectiveness of your caching mechanisms under load.
*   **Optimize Database Queries:**  Slow database queries are a common cause of performance bottlenecks.  Optimize your queries and use database indexes effectively.
*   **Use Connection Pooling:**  Connection pooling can improve database performance by reducing the overhead of creating and destroying database connections.

## Conclusion

Load testing is essential for ensuring the performance, scalability, and reliability of your NestJS applications. By using tools like k6 and Artillery, you can simulate real-world traffic, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize your application for optimal performance. Remember to follow best practices and continuously monitor your application's performance to deliver a great user experience.  Good luck!
