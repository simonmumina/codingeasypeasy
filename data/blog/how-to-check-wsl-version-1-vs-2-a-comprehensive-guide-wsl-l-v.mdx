# How to Check WSL Version (1 vs 2): A Comprehensive Guide (wsl -l -v)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has revolutionized the way developers work on Windows, offering a seamless integration of Linux environments. Understanding which version of WSL you're running – WSL 1 or WSL 2 – is crucial for optimizing performance, compatibility, and overall development experience. This guide will walk you through the process of checking your WSL version using the command line and explain the key differences between WSL 1 and WSL 2.

## Why Knowing Your WSL Version Matters

Before diving into the "how," let's understand the "why." WSL 1 and WSL 2 are fundamentally different architectures.

- **WSL 1:** Emulates the Linux kernel interface. It translates Linux system calls into Windows NT system calls. This approach offers great file system performance within the Windows file system.

- **WSL 2:** Runs a real Linux kernel inside a lightweight virtual machine (VM). This provides full system call compatibility, significantly improving performance, especially for file-intensive operations and Docker integration.

Choosing the right WSL version depends on your specific needs:

- **WSL 1:** Suitable for simpler tasks and scenarios where file access within the Windows file system is paramount.

- **WSL 2:** Recommended for most modern development workflows, including Docker, large projects, and computationally intensive tasks.

Knowing your WSL version helps you:

- **Troubleshoot issues:** Many problems are version-specific.
- **Optimize performance:** Choose the appropriate WSL version for your workload.
- **Ensure compatibility:** Certain tools and technologies may require a specific WSL version.

## Checking Your WSL Version: The `wsl -l -v` Command

The simplest and most reliable way to check your WSL version is using the `wsl -l -v` command in the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:** Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in the Windows search bar and open the application. Make sure you run as Administrator if you want to perform advanced WSL operations.

2.  **Execute the Command:** Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```plaintext
    wsl -l -v
    ```

    or

    ```plaintext
    wsl --list --verbose
    ```

    These commands do the same thing. The first option is simply shorter.

3.  **Interpret the Output:** The command will display a table similar to this:

    ```
      NAME            STATE           VERSION
    * Ubuntu-20.04    Stopped         2
      Debian          Running         1
    ```

    - **NAME:** Shows the name of your installed WSL distribution.
    - **STATE:** Indicates the current state of the distribution (Running, Stopped, etc.).
    - **VERSION:** Displays the WSL version (1 or 2) assigned to that specific distribution.

    The asterisk `*` next to the distribution name signifies the default WSL distribution.

**Example Output and Explanation:**

In the example output above:

- `Ubuntu-20.04` is running under WSL version 2.
- `Debian` is running under WSL version 1.

This clearly shows you which distributions are running under each WSL version.

## Alternative Method: `wslconfig` (Deprecated, but sometimes useful)

While `wsl -l -v` is the preferred method, you might encounter older documentation or scenarios where `wslconfig` is mentioned. `wslconfig` is a deprecated tool, but it's still worth knowing about.

**Syntax (Deprecated):**

```plaintext
wslconfig /l
```

or

```plaintext
wslconfig /list
```

However, `wslconfig` does NOT show the WSL version directly. It only lists the installed distributions. You would then need to infer the version based on when it was installed and the default WSL version at the time. Therefore, `wsl -l -v` is strongly recommended over `wslconfig`.

## Changing Your WSL Version

If you need to change the WSL version of a specific distribution (e.g., from WSL 1 to WSL 2 or vice-versa), you can use the following command:

```plaintext
wsl --set-version <DistributionName> <VersionNumber>
```

- `<DistributionName>`: The name of the WSL distribution you want to modify (e.g., `Ubuntu-20.04`).
- `<VersionNumber>`: The desired WSL version (1 or 2).

**Example: Changing Ubuntu-20.04 to WSL 2:**

```plaintext
wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
```

**Important Considerations When Switching Versions:**

- **Conversion Time:** Converting between WSL 1 and WSL 2 can take a significant amount of time, especially for large distributions.

- **WSL 2 Requires Virtualization:** WSL 2 relies on Hyper-V. Ensure that hardware virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI settings.

- **Data Migration:** If you're switching from WSL 1 to WSL 2, your files are not automatically migrated. You can either move them using the Windows file system (accessing your WSL files via `\\wsl$\<DistributionName>`) or by creating a backup and restoring it in the new environment. The first option is generally recommended.

- **WSL 2 Requires WSL 2 Kernel:** Make sure you have the WSL 2 Linux kernel installed. You can update it by running `wsl --update`.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**1. `wsl` Command Not Found:**

This usually indicates that WSL is not properly installed or the `wsl` executable is not in your system's `PATH` environment variable. Reinstall WSL, ensuring that you follow the official Microsoft documentation (linked below).

**2. Error: "WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component..."**

Run the following command to update the WSL kernel:

```plaintext
wsl --update
```

You may also need to download and install the latest WSL2 Linux kernel update package from the Microsoft website: [https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel)

**3. Hardware Virtualization Not Enabled:**

If you encounter errors related to virtualization, you need to enable hardware virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI settings. The exact steps vary depending on your motherboard manufacturer. Consult your motherboard manual or search online for instructions specific to your model. Also, make sure Hyper-V is enabled in Windows Features.

## Conclusion

Checking your WSL version is a simple but essential step in managing your development environment. By using the `wsl -l -v` command and understanding the differences between WSL 1 and WSL 2, you can optimize your workflow and ensure compatibility with your tools and technologies. Remember to keep your WSL kernel updated for the best performance and security. Happy coding!
