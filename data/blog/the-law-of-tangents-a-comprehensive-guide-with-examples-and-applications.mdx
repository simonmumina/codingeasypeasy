# The Law of Tangents: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples & Applications

The Law of Tangents is a trigonometric identity that relates the lengths of two sides of a triangle to the tangents of half the difference and half the sum of the angles opposite those sides. While often overshadowed by the Law of Sines and Law of Cosines, the Law of Tangents offers a unique and sometimes more efficient approach to solving for missing angles or sides in *oblique triangles* (triangles that are not right-angled).

## What is the Law of Tangents?

The Law of Tangents states that for any triangle with sides *a*, *b*, and *c*, and angles *A*, *B*, and *C* opposite those sides respectively, the following relationships hold:

*   **Formula 1:**

    ```
    (a - b) / (a + b) = tan((A - B) / 2) / tan((A + B) / 2)
    ```

*   **Formula 2:**

    ```
    (b - c) / (b + c) = tan((B - C) / 2) / tan((B + C) / 2)
    ```

*   **Formula 3:**

    ```
    (a - c) / (a + c) = tan((A - C) / 2) / tan((A + C) / 2)
    ```

These formulas are variations of the same principle, simply adapted to different pairs of sides and angles.  The key is to correctly identify which sides and angles you're working with.

## Understanding the Formula

Let's break down Formula 1 to understand what it's saying:

*   **(a - b) / (a + b):**  This represents the ratio of the difference between two sides (*a* and *b*) to their sum.
*   **(A - B) / 2:**  This is half the difference between the angles opposite sides *a* and *b*.
*   **(A + B) / 2:**  This is half the sum of the angles opposite sides *a* and *b*. Since the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°,  (A + B) / 2  is equal to (180° - C) / 2 = 90° - (C / 2).
*   **tan((A - B) / 2) / tan((A + B) / 2):**  This is the ratio of the tangents of half the difference and half the sum of the angles.

Essentially, the Law of Tangents relates a ratio based on the *lengths of sides* to a ratio based on the *angles opposite those sides*.

## When to Use the Law of Tangents

The Law of Tangents is most useful in the following scenarios:

*   **Given Two Sides and the Included Angle (SAS):** If you know the lengths of two sides of a triangle (*a* and *b*) and the angle between them (*C*), you can use the Law of Tangents to find the other two angles (*A* and *B*).
*   **Given Two Angles and a Side (AAS or ASA):**  If you know two angles (*A* and *B*) and a side (e.g., *a*), you can first find the third angle (*C* = 180° - A - B). Then, you can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines to find the remaining sides. The Law of Tangents can be useful as a step in the process in specific circumstances.

It's important to note that while you *can* technically use the Law of Tangents when given three sides (SSS), it's generally more straightforward to use the Law of Cosines in that case.

## Examples of Using the Law of Tangents

**Example 1: Given Two Sides and the Included Angle (SAS)**

Suppose we have a triangle where:

*   *a* = 10
*   *b* = 7
*   *C* = 35°

We want to find angles *A* and *B*.

1.  **Apply Formula 1:**

    ```
    (a - b) / (a + b) = tan((A - B) / 2) / tan((A + B) / 2)
    (10 - 7) / (10 + 7) = tan((A - B) / 2) / tan((A + B) / 2)
    3 / 17 = tan((A - B) / 2) / tan((A + B) / 2)
    ```

2.  **Find (A + B) / 2:**

    Since *A + B + C = 180°*, then *A + B = 180° - C = 180° - 35° = 145°*.
    Therefore, *(A + B) / 2 = 145° / 2 = 72.5°*.

3.  **Substitute and solve for tan((A - B) / 2):**

    ```
    3 / 17 = tan((A - B) / 2) / tan(72.5°)
    tan((A - B) / 2) = (3 / 17) * tan(72.5°)
    tan((A - B) / 2) ≈ (3 / 17) * 3.1716
    tan((A - B) / 2) ≈ 0.5596
    ```

4.  **Find (A - B) / 2:**

    ```
    (A - B) / 2 = arctan(0.5596)
    (A - B) / 2 ≈ 29.25°
    ```

5.  **Solve the system of equations:**

    We now have two equations:

    *   *(A + B) / 2 = 72.5°  =>  A + B = 145°*
    *   *(A - B) / 2 = 29.25° => A - B = 58.5°*

    Adding the two equations:

    ```
    2A = 203.5°
    A = 101.75°
    ```

    Substituting *A* back into *A + B = 145°*:

    ```
    101.75° + B = 145°
    B = 43.25°
    ```

Therefore, *A ≈ 101.75°* and *B ≈ 43.25°*.

**Example 2: Python Code for the Law of Tangents**

Here's a Python function to calculate the angles A and B given sides a, b, and angle C using the Law of Tangents:

```python
import math

def law_of_tangents(a, b, c_degrees):
  """
  Calculates angles A and B of a triangle using the Law of Tangents.

  Args:
    a: Length of side a.
    b: Length of side b.
    c_degrees: Angle C in degrees.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing angles A and B in degrees, or None if the input is invalid.
  """

  if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c_degrees <= 0 or c_degrees >= 180:
    return None  # Invalid input

  c_radians = math.radians(c_degrees)
  half_sum_ab = (math.pi - c_radians) / 2
  half_diff_ab_tan = ((a - b) / (a + b)) * math.tan(half_sum_ab)
  half_diff_ab = math.atan(half_diff_ab_tan)

  a_radians = half_sum_ab + half_diff_ab
  b_radians = half_sum_ab - half_diff_ab

  a_degrees = math.degrees(a_radians)
  b_degrees = math.degrees(b_radians)

  return a_degrees, b_degrees

# Example usage:
a = 10
b = 7
c_degrees = 35
result = law_of_tangents(a, b, c_degrees)

if result:
  a_degrees, b_degrees = result
  print(f"Angle A: {a_degrees:.2f} degrees")
  print(f"Angle B: {b_degrees:.2f} degrees")
else:
  print("Invalid input.")
```

This Python code mirrors the calculations performed in Example 1, offering a programmatic approach to solving problems using the Law of Tangents. The included error handling ensures the function returns `None` for invalid inputs like non-positive side lengths or invalid angles.

## Law of Tangents vs. Law of Sines vs. Law of Cosines

It's crucial to understand the differences between these three fundamental trigonometric laws:

| Feature         | Law of Sines                      | Law of Cosines                                  | Law of Tangents                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Formula**      | a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)      | a² = b² + c² - 2bc * cos(A)                    | (a-b)/(a+b) = tan((A-B)/2) / tan((A+B)/2)        |
| **Use Cases**    | ASA, AAS, SSA (ambiguous case)     | SSS, SAS                                         | SAS                                            |
| **Information Required** | A side and opposite angle, plus one other piece of information |  Three sides, or two sides and the included angle | Two sides and the included angle               |
| **Strengths**    | Relatively simple to use for finding angles when given sides.       | Useful for finding sides when given angles and sides. Avoids ambiguous case in some scenarios compared to Sines. | Can be useful for solving for angles directly from two sides and the included angle. |
| **Weaknesses**   | The ambiguous case (SSA).         | More complex calculations.                       | Less commonly taught or remembered. More complex calculation. |

*   **Law of Sines:**  Best suited when you have a side and its opposite angle, along with another side or angle. The Law of Sines is particularly helpful in cases of ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) and AAS (Angle-Angle-Side). However, it can run into the "ambiguous case" (SSA) where there might be two possible solutions.

*   **Law of Cosines:**  Ideal for situations where you know three sides (SSS) or two sides and the included angle (SAS).  It's especially useful when the Law of Sines might lead to ambiguities.

*   **Law of Tangents:** Primarily useful for SAS cases, particularly when you want to directly calculate the two unknown angles *A* and *B* before finding the third side.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

*   **Direct Angle Calculation:**  The Law of Tangents can directly solve for the difference between two angles in SAS scenarios.
*   **Avoidance of Ambiguous Case (Sometimes):** While not its primary strength, the Law of Tangents can sometimes help avoid the ambiguous case that arises with the Law of Sines because you are not directly finding angles from sine values.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Less Familiar:** The Law of Tangents is less widely taught and remembered than the Law of Sines and Cosines.
*   **More Complex Calculations:** The formula is arguably more involved than the formulas for the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines.
*   **Limited Use Cases:**  Its primary application is in SAS scenarios, making it less versatile than the other two laws.

## Conclusion

While not as universally applicable as the Law of Sines and Law of Cosines, the Law of Tangents provides a valuable tool in the trigonometric toolbox. Understanding its unique properties and when to apply it can lead to more efficient and elegant solutions to certain triangle-solving problems.  By grasping the core concepts and practicing with examples, you can master this powerful technique and expand your problem-solving abilities in trigonometry.
