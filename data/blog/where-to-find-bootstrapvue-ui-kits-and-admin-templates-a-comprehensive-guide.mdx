# Where to Find BootstrapVue UI Kits and Admin Templates: A Comprehensive Guide

BootstrapVue is a powerful library that combines the ease of use of Bootstrap with the reactivity and flexibility of Vue.js. It allows developers to rapidly prototype and build complex user interfaces with pre-built components. But where do you find high-quality UI kits and admin templates built with BootstrapVue to accelerate your development process? This guide explores various resources, both free and premium, to help you find the perfect starting point for your next project.

## Why Use BootstrapVue UI Kits and Admin Templates?

Before diving into where to find these resources, let's quickly recap the benefits of using BootstrapVue UI kits and admin templates:

*   **Faster Development:** Pre-built components and layouts save significant time and effort.
*   **Consistent Design:** Enforces a uniform look and feel across your application.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensures your application works seamlessly on different devices.
*   **Accessibility:** Many templates are designed with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines.
*   **Customizability:** BootstrapVue components are highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the template to your specific needs.

## Where to Find BootstrapVue Resources

Here's a breakdown of the best places to find BootstrapVue UI kits and admin templates, categorized for easy navigation:

### 1. Official BootstrapVue Documentation

The official BootstrapVue documentation ([https://bootstrap-vue.org/](https://bootstrap-vue.org/)) is the *first* place you should visit.  While it doesn't offer complete templates, it provides extensive documentation on each component, including examples and usage instructions. This helps you understand how to effectively utilize individual components within your own projects or pre-existing templates.

**Example:**

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button variant="primary">Primary Button</b-button>
    <b-button variant="success">Success Button</b-button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent'
}
</script>
```

This simple example demonstrates how to use the `b-button` component with different variants.  Explore the documentation to discover the wide range of available components and their properties.

### 2. Creative Tim

Creative Tim ([https://www.creative-tim.com/](https://www.creative-tim.com/)) offers a variety of UI kits and admin templates built with Vue.js, some of which utilize BootstrapVue. While they might not explicitly advertise every template as *solely* BootstrapVue, it's worth exploring their offerings and filtering by Vue.js to find potentially suitable options.  They typically provide both free and premium versions.

**Things to consider when browsing Creative Tim:**

*   **Check the Technology Stack:** Carefully examine the template's description to confirm if it incorporates BootstrapVue.
*   **Live Demos:**  Utilize their live demos to thoroughly evaluate the template's features and design.
*   **Pricing:**  Free templates often have limited features and support compared to premium versions.

### 3. WrapPixel

WrapPixel ([https://www.wrappixel.com/](https://www.wrappixel.com/)) is another excellent source for premium admin templates.  While they may not always explicitly label templates as "BootstrapVue," many of their Vue.js admin dashboards are built *using* the Bootstrap framework, which can often be adapted or easily integrated with BootstrapVue components.  Again, careful research is required.

**Key Considerations for WrapPixel:**

*   **Framework Compatibility:** Verify that the underlying Bootstrap framework aligns with BootstrapVue's version requirements.
*   **Customization:**  Assess the template's customizability to ensure it can be tailored to your specific branding and functionality.
*   **Support:**  Evaluate the level of support provided for the template, especially if you're less experienced.

### 4. ThemeForest (Envato Market)

ThemeForest ([https://themeforest.net/](https://themeforest.net/)) is a massive marketplace for website themes and templates. You can search for "Vue admin template" or "Vue UI kit" and then filter the results to specifically include options that mention BootstrapVue in their description or features list.

**Tips for using ThemeForest:**

*   **Reviews and Ratings:**  Pay close attention to user reviews and ratings to gauge the template's quality and reliability.
*   **Preview and Documentation:**  Thoroughly examine the live preview and documentation before purchasing.
*   **Author Reputation:** Research the author's reputation and track record of providing support and updates.

### 5. UIdeck

UIdeck ([https://uideck.com/](https://uideck.com/)) is known for its high-quality UI kits and landing page templates. While dedicated BootstrapVue templates might be less common, you can find well-designed Vue.js templates that could be adapted or enhanced with BootstrapVue components.

**How to approach UIdeck:**

*   **Vue.js Focus:** Concentrate on templates built primarily with Vue.js.
*   **Component Integration:** Evaluate the effort required to integrate BootstrapVue components into the existing template structure.
*   **Design Inspiration:** Even if you don't use a template directly, UIdeck can provide valuable design inspiration.

### 6. Open Source Repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

GitHub and GitLab are treasure troves of open-source projects. You might find smaller BootstrapVue UI kits or starter templates shared by the community.

**Example GitHub Search:**

`github.com search "BootstrapVue Vue.js template"`

**Benefits of Open Source:**

*   **Free:** Open-source projects are typically free to use.
*   **Community Support:** You can often find help and support from the community.
*   **Customization:**  You have complete control over the codebase and can customize it to your exact needs.

**Drawbacks of Open Source:**

*   **Maintenance:** May not be actively maintained or updated.
*   **Documentation:** Documentation may be incomplete or lacking.
*   **Security:**  Thoroughly review the code for security vulnerabilities.

### 7. VuejS Components Libraries (Complementary to BootstrapVue)

While not strictly UI kits, libraries like Element Plus ([https://element-plus.org/en-US/](https://element-plus.org/en-US/)) and Vuetify ([https://vuetifyjs.com/en/](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)) offer extensive component sets. You *could* use them alongside BootstrapVue if you require specific components not found in BootstrapVue itself.  However, mixing component libraries can increase bundle size and potential conflicts.

**Example integrating BootstrapVue Button with Element Plus Layout:**

```vue
<template>
  <el-container>
    <el-header>My Awesome Header</el-header>
    <el-main>
      <b-button variant="primary">Click Me!</b-button>
    </el-main>
    <el-footer>Footer</el-footer>
  </el-container>
</template>

<script>
import { ElContainer, ElHeader, ElMain, ElFooter } from 'element-plus';
import { BButton } from 'bootstrap-vue'; // Import BootstrapVue button

export default {
  components: {
    ElContainer,
    ElHeader,
    ElMain,
    ElFooter,
    BButton // Register the BootstrapVue Button
  }
};
</script>
```

**Important Note:** Using multiple component libraries is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary. Choose *one* core library (BootstrapVue, Element Plus, Vuetify, etc.) and stick to it for consistency and performance.

## Free vs. Premium BootstrapVue Templates

When choosing a BootstrapVue UI kit or admin template, you'll encounter both free and premium options. Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature          | Free Templates                      | Premium Templates                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Cost             | Free                                | Paid                                  |
| Features         | Limited features and functionality | More comprehensive features and functionality |
| Design           | Basic design                        | More polished and professional design |
| Support          | Limited or no support               | Dedicated support and updates        |
| Customization    | Limited customization options        | Greater customization options          |
| Documentation    | Often lacking or incomplete        | More detailed and complete           |

| Updates          | Infrequent or no updates             | Regular updates and bug fixes        |

**When to Choose Free:**

*   For small personal projects or prototypes.

**When to Choose Premium:**

*   For commercial projects or applications.
