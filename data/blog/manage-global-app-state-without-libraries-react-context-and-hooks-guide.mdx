# Manage Global App State Without Libraries: React Context and Hooks Guide

Managing application state effectively is crucial for building robust and maintainable React applications. While libraries like Redux, Zustand, and MobX offer powerful solutions, they can sometimes introduce unnecessary complexity, especially for smaller to medium-sized projects. React itself provides excellent tools, namely the Context API and Hooks, to handle global app state efficiently without relying on third-party dependencies. This blog post delves into how to leverage these built-in features to create a clean and performant state management solution.

## Why Avoid Third-Party Libraries (Sometimes)?

Before we dive into the implementation, let's consider why you might want to avoid third-party libraries for state management:

- **Reduced Bundle Size:** Libraries add to your application's bundle size, which can impact initial load times and overall performance, especially for mobile users. Every kilobyte counts!
- **Simplified Development:** Less code means less to debug and maintain. Using React's built-in tools simplifies your codebase and reduces the learning curve for new developers.
- **Faster Development:** Setting up and configuring complex state management libraries can be time-consuming. Context and Hooks offer a quicker path to a functional state management solution.
- **Less Dependency on External Updates:** Reducing your dependency on external libraries makes your application more resistant to breaking changes and reduces the need for frequent updates.
- **Clarity and Understanding:** For simpler applications, using native React features can be more transparent and easier to understand than learning the intricacies of a complex state management library.

**However, it's important to note:** Third-party libraries become _essential_ for large, complex applications with intricate data flows and advanced requirements like time-travel debugging or immutable data structures. Choose the right tool for the job!

## The Power of React Context

React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It allows components to access data directly from a provider component, regardless of their position in the tree. This is perfect for managing global state that needs to be accessible throughout the application.

### Creating a Context

First, you need to create a context using `React.createContext()`. It's good practice to create a dedicated file for your context, for example, `AppContext.js`:

```plaintext
// AppContext.js
import { createContext } from 'react';

const AppContext = createContext({
  theme: 'light',
  toggleTheme: () => {},
  user: null,
  login: () => {},
  logout: () => {}
});

export default AppContext;
```

In this example, we've created an `AppContext` with a default value that includes:

- `theme`: A string representing the current theme ('light' or 'dark').
- `toggleTheme`: A function to toggle the theme.
- `user`: An object representing the logged-in user (initially null).
- `login`: A function to log in a user.
- `logout`: A function to log out a user.

**Important:** The default value is only used when a component tries to consume the context _outside_ of a Provider.

### Creating a Context Provider

Next, you need to create a provider component that will manage the state and provide it to the rest of the application. This component will wrap your app and make the context values available to all its children. Let's create a `AppProvider.js` file:

```plaintext
// AppProvider.js
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import AppContext from './AppContext';

const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  const toggleTheme = useCallback(() => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  }, []);

  const login = useCallback((userData) => {
    setUser(userData);
  }, []);

  const logout = useCallback(() => {
    setUser(null);
  }, []);


  const contextValue = {
    theme,
    toggleTheme,
    user,
    login,
    logout
  };

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default AppProvider;
```

Here's a breakdown:

- We import `useState` and `useCallback` from `react` to manage the theme and user state.
- We define `toggleTheme`, `login`, and `logout` functions to update the state. `useCallback` is crucial for performance optimization. It memoizes these functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders of components that consume the context.
- We create a `contextValue` object that holds the current state and the functions to update it. This is the value that will be passed to the context provider.
- We wrap the `children` prop with `AppContext.Provider` and pass the `contextValue` as the `value` prop. This makes the state and functions available to all child components.

### Wrapping Your Application with the Provider

Now, you need to wrap your main application component with the `AppProvider` to make the context available. In your `App.js` or similar entry point:

```plaintext
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import AppProvider from './AppProvider';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
import AnotherComponent from './AnotherComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <AppProvider>
      <MyComponent />
      <AnotherComponent />
    </AppProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Consuming the Context with `useContext`

Now that the context is set up and the provider is wrapping your application, you can consume the context in any component using the `useContext` hook.

```plaintext
// MyComponent.js
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import AppContext from './AppContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme, user, login, logout } = useContext(AppContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
      {user ? (
        <>
          <p>Welcome, {user.name}!</p>
          <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => login({ name: 'John Doe' })}>Login</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example:

- We import `useContext` and the `AppContext`.
- We use `useContext(AppContext)` to access the context value.
- We destructure the `theme`, `toggleTheme`, `user`, `login`, and `logout` values from the context.
- We use these values to display the current theme and user information and provide buttons to toggle the theme and log in/log out.

## Optimizing Performance

While Context API is a powerful tool, it's important to be mindful of performance. By default, any component consuming a context will re-render whenever the context value changes. This can lead to performance issues if the context value changes frequently and many components are consuming it. Here are some techniques to optimize performance:

### 1. Memoize Context Values

As shown in the `AppProvider.js` example, use `useCallback` to memoize the functions that update the state. This prevents unnecessary re-renders of components that consume the context because the function identities remain the same unless their dependencies change.

### 2. Use `useMemo` for Complex Context Values

If your context value contains complex objects or arrays, use `useMemo` to memoize the value. This ensures that the context value only changes when the underlying data changes, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

```plaintext
// AppProvider.js
import React, { useState, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';
import AppContext from './AppContext';

const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  const toggleTheme = useCallback(() => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  }, []);

  const login = useCallback((userData) => {
    setUser(userData);
  }, []);

  const logout = useCallback(() => {
    setUser(null);
  }, []);


  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({
    theme,
    toggleTheme,
    user,
    login,
    logout
  }), [theme, user, toggleTheme, login, logout]); // Dependencies determine when contextValue changes

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default AppProvider;
```

### 3. Split Contexts

If your global state contains unrelated pieces of data, consider splitting it into multiple contexts. This reduces the number of components that re-render when a specific piece of state changes. For example, you could have a `ThemeContext` and a `UserContext`.

### 4. Selectors (Custom Hooks)

Create custom hooks that only expose the specific parts of the context value that a component needs. This prevents the component from re-rendering when other parts of the context value change.

```plaintext
// useTheme.js
import { useContext } from 'react';
import AppContext from './AppContext';

const useTheme = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(AppContext);
  return { theme, toggleTheme };
};

export default useTheme;

// MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import useTheme from './useTheme';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current Theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now, `MyComponent` will only re-render when the `theme` or `toggleTheme` values change, not when the `user` logs in or out.

## Example: Persisting State to Local Storage

Let's extend our example to persist the theme and user data to local storage, so they are preserved across page reloads.

```plaintext
// AppProvider.js
import React, { useState, useCallback, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react';
import AppContext from './AppContext';

const AppProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(() => {
    // Initialize from local storage or default to 'light'
    return localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
  });

  const [user, setUser] = useState(() => {
    // Initialize from local storage or default to null
    const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('user');
    return storedUser ? JSON.parse(storedUser) : null;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
  }, [theme]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (user) {
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
    } else {
      localStorage.removeItem('user'); // Clear user data on logout
    }
  }, [user]);



  const toggleTheme = useCallback(() => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  }, []);

  const login = useCallback((userData) => {
    setUser(userData);
  }, []);

  const logout = useCallback(() => {
    setUser(null);
  }, []);


  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({
    theme,
    toggleTheme,
    user,
    login,
    logout
  }), [theme, user, toggleTheme, login, logout]);

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default AppProvider;
```

Key changes:

- **Initial State from Local Storage:** We use a function as the initial value for `useState` to read the theme and user data from local storage when the component mounts. This ensures that the state is initialized with the persisted values.
- **`useEffect` for Persistence:** We use `useEffect` hooks to persist the theme and user data to local storage whenever they change. When the user logs out, we remove the user data from local storage.

## Conclusion

Managing global app state with React Context and Hooks offers a lightweight and efficient alternative to third-party libraries, especially for smaller to medium-sized projects. By understanding the core concepts and applying performance optimization techniques, you can create a clean and maintainable state management solution that aligns perfectly with your application's needs. Remember to evaluate your project's complexity carefully before choosing a state management approach; larger, more intricate applications may still benefit from the power and features of dedicated libraries. This guide provides a solid foundation for building scalable and performant React applications without the added overhead of external dependencies.
