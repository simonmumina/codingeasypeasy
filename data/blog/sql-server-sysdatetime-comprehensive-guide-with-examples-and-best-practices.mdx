# SQL Server SYSDATETIME(): Comprehensive Guide with Examples & Best Practices

Working with date and time is a common task in database development. SQL Server provides several built-in functions to retrieve the current date and time. One of the most useful is `SYSDATETIME()`. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide to the `SYSDATETIME()` function in SQL Server, covering its syntax, usage, differences from other date functions like `GETDATE()` and `SYSUTCDATETIME()`, performance considerations, and best practices, accompanied by practical examples.

## What is SYSDATETIME()?

The `SYSDATETIME()` function in SQL Server returns the date and time of the SQL Server instance's host operating system. The returned value includes fractional seconds with a precision of up to seven digits (accuracy in the nanoseconds range). This level of precision makes `SYSDATETIME()` ideal for applications requiring highly accurate timestamps.

## Syntax

The syntax for `SYSDATETIME()` is simple:

```sql
SYSDATETIME ( )
```

It doesn't accept any input parameters. It simply returns a `datetime2` value representing the current date and time.

## Basic Usage Examples

Here are some basic examples demonstrating how to use `SYSDATETIME()`:

**1. Retrieving the current date and time:**

```sql
SELECT SYSDATETIME();
```

This query will return the current date and time of the SQL Server instance's host operating system. The output will be in the `datetime2` format. For example:

```
2024-10-27 10:30:00.1234567
```

**2. Inserting the current date and time into a table:**

Let's assume we have a table called `Orders` with a column named `OrderDate` of type `datetime2`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(255),
    OrderDate DATETIME2
);

INSERT INTO Orders (ProductName, OrderDate)
VALUES ('Product A', SYSDATETIME());

SELECT * FROM Orders;
```

This will insert a new row into the `Orders` table with the `OrderDate` set to the current date and time.

**3. Using `SYSDATETIME()` in a `WHERE` clause:**

You can use `SYSDATETIME()` in a `WHERE` clause to filter data based on date and time. For example, to retrieve all orders placed in the last hour:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(hour, -1, SYSDATETIME());
```

This query uses `DATEADD()` to subtract one hour from the current date and time, effectively filtering the results to include only orders placed within the past hour.

## Comparing SYSDATETIME() with other Date and Time Functions

SQL Server offers several other functions for retrieving date and time information. Let's compare `SYSDATETIME()` with some of the most commonly used ones:

**1. `GETDATE()`:**

- **Return Type:** `datetime`
- **Precision:** Approximately accurate to 3.33 milliseconds (less precise than `SYSDATETIME()`).
- **Usage:** Returns the current date and time of the SQL Server instance's host operating system.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT GETDATE();
  ```

  The main difference between `GETDATE()` and `SYSDATETIME()` is the data type and precision. `GETDATE()` returns a `datetime` value which has lower precision than the `datetime2` value returned by `SYSDATETIME()`.

**2. `SYSUTCDATETIME()`:**

- **Return Type:** `datetime2`
- **Precision:** Up to seven digits (same as `SYSDATETIME()`).
- **Usage:** Returns the current UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) date and time.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT SYSUTCDATETIME();
  ```

  `SYSUTCDATETIME()` returns the UTC time, while `SYSDATETIME()` returns the local time of the SQL Server instance. If you need to work with dates and times in a time zone-independent manner, `SYSUTCDATETIME()` is the preferred choice.

**3. `GETUTCDATE()`:**

- **Return Type:** `datetime`
- **Precision:** Approximately accurate to 3.33 milliseconds (less precise than `SYSUTCDATETIME()`).
- **Usage:** Returns the current UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) date and time.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT GETUTCDATE();
  ```

  Similar to the comparison between `GETDATE()` and `SYSDATETIME()`, the primary difference between `GETUTCDATE()` and `SYSUTCDATETIME()` lies in the data type and precision. `GETUTCDATE()` returns a `datetime` value, whereas `SYSUTCDATETIME()` returns a `datetime2` value with higher precision.

**4. `SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()`:**

- **Return Type:** `datetimeoffset`
- **Precision:** Up to seven digits (same as `SYSDATETIME()`).
- **Usage:** Returns the current date and time of the SQL Server instance's host operating system, including the time zone offset.
- **Example:**

  ```sql
  SELECT SYSDATETIMEOFFSET();
  ```

  `SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()` is the most comprehensive of these functions. It provides the date, time, and time zone offset. If you need to store and work with time zone information, this function is the best choice.

**Summary Table:**

| Function              | Return Type      | Precision                        | Time Zone Information |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `GETDATE()`           | `datetime`       | Approximately 3.33 milliseconds  | Local                 |
| `SYSDATETIME()`       | `datetime2`      | Up to seven digits (nanoseconds) | Local                 |
| `GETUTCDATE()`        | `datetime`       | Approximately 3.33 milliseconds  | UTC                   |
| `SYSUTCDATETIME()`    | `datetime2`      | Up to seven digits (nanoseconds) | UTC                   |
| `SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()` | `datetimeoffset` | Up to seven digits (nanoseconds) | Local + Offset        |

## Performance Considerations

While `SYSDATETIME()` is generally efficient, it's essential to consider its impact on performance, especially in frequently executed queries or large datasets.

- **Indexing:** When filtering data based on date and time values, ensure that the relevant columns are properly indexed. This will significantly improve query performance.

- **Data Type Considerations:** If you only need date information, consider storing the date in a `date` column. If you need date and time, choose `datetime2` (for precision) or `datetime` (for compatibility), depending on your requirements. Using appropriate data types can optimize storage and query performance. Avoid using `varchar` or other string types to store date and time values.

- **Function Calls:** While `SYSDATETIME()` is fast, excessive calls within loops or user-defined functions can impact performance. Consider caching the result of `SYSDATETIME()` if you need to use it multiple times within a short period.

- **Nondeterministic Functions:** `SYSDATETIME()` is considered a nondeterministic function because its return value can change each time it's called. This can affect the ability of the query optimizer to cache execution plans. If performance is critical and you need a consistent value within a query, consider assigning the result of `SYSDATETIME()` to a variable and using that variable throughout the query.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when using `SYSDATETIME()`:

- **Choose the Right Function:** Select the appropriate date and time function based on your specific requirements. If you need high precision, use `SYSDATETIME()` or `SYSUTCDATETIME()`. If you need time zone information, use `SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()`.
- **Store Dates and Times Correctly:** Use the appropriate data types (`date`, `datetime`, `datetime2`, `datetimeoffset`) to store date and time values.
- **Use Indexes:** Index columns that are frequently used in date and time-based filtering.
- **Handle Time Zones:** Be aware of time zone considerations, especially when working with data from different regions. Consider using `SYSUTCDATETIME()` and storing time zone offsets when appropriate.
- **Format Dates and Times for Presentation:** Use the `CONVERT()` or `FORMAT()` functions to format date and time values for display purposes. Avoid relying on implicit conversions, as they can lead to unexpected results and performance issues. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT FORMAT(SYSDATETIME(), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff'); -- Formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS. Milliseconds
  SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, SYSDATETIME(), 120);       --ODBC canonical (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss(mmm))
  ```

- **Avoid String Comparisons:** Don't compare date and time values as strings. Instead, compare them using date and time data types.

## Advanced Examples

**1. Calculating the difference between two dates with high precision:**

```sql
DECLARE @StartTime DATETIME2 = '2024-10-27 00:00:00.1234567';
DECLARE @EndTime DATETIME2 = SYSDATETIME();

SELECT DATEDIFF(millisecond, @StartTime, @EndTime) AS MillisecondDifference;
SELECT DATEDIFF(second, @StartTime, @EndTime) AS SecondDifference;

--For nanosecond level, needs some additional computation.
--DATEDIFF doesn't support nanoseconds
SELECT ((CAST(@EndTime AS DECIMAL(27,7)) - CAST(@StartTime AS DECIMAL(27,7))) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 10000000) AS NanosecondDifference
```

This example demonstrates how to calculate the difference between two dates using `DATEDIFF()`. Note that `DATEDIFF()` has a limited resolution. For more precise calculations (e.g. nanoseconds), you might need to cast the `datetime2` values to `decimal` and perform the calculation manually, as shown in the NanosecondDifference calculation.

**2. Combining `SYSDATETIME()` with other functions for reporting:**

```sql
SELECT
    FORMAT(SYSDATETIME(), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS CurrentDate,
    FORMAT(SYSDATETIME(), 'HH:mm:ss') AS CurrentTime,
    DAY(SYSDATETIME()) AS DayOfMonth,
    MONTH(SYSDATETIME()) AS MonthOfYear,
    YEAR(SYSDATETIME()) AS Year,
    DATENAME(weekday, SYSDATETIME()) AS DayOfWeek;
```

This query combines `SYSDATETIME()` with functions like `FORMAT()`, `DAY()`, `MONTH()`, `YEAR()`, and `DATENAME()` to extract and format different components of the current date and time for reporting purposes.

## Conclusion

The `SYSDATETIME()` function in SQL Server is a powerful tool for retrieving the current date and time with high precision. By understanding its syntax, usage, differences from other date functions, performance considerations, and best practices, you can effectively leverage `SYSDATETIME()` in your database development projects. Always consider your specific requirements and choose the most appropriate date and time function for the task at hand. Remember to use appropriate data types, indexes, and formatting techniques to optimize performance and ensure accuracy.
