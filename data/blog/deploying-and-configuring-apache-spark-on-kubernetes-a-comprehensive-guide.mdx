## Why Use Spark on Kubernetes?

Using Spark on Kubernetes offers several advantages:

- **Scalability:** Kubernetes allows you to easily scale your Spark cluster based on the demands of your workload. You can dynamically allocate resources to Spark applications as needed, ensuring efficient utilization of your infrastructure.
- **Resource Management:** Kubernetes provides fine-grained resource management, allowing you to control the CPU, memory, and other resources allocated to Spark drivers and executors. This prevents resource contention and improves overall performance.
- **Isolation:** Containers provide isolation between Spark applications, preventing interference and ensuring that each application has the resources it needs.
- **Portability:** Containerizing Spark applications with Docker allows you to easily deploy them across different environments, from development to production.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Kubernetes automates the deployment and management of Spark applications, reducing the operational overhead.
- **Cost Optimization:** Dynamic allocation of resources in Kubernetes can lead to significant cost savings by only using resources when they are needed.
- **Integration with Cloud Services:** Kubernetes integrates seamlessly with cloud services like AWS, Azure, and GCP, making it easy to deploy Spark applications in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Kubernetes Cluster:** A running Kubernetes cluster is required. You can use a managed Kubernetes service like Amazon EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or a self-managed cluster using tools like Minikube or Kind for local development.
- **kubectl:** The Kubernetes command-line tool (`kubectl`) should be installed and configured to connect to your cluster.
- **Docker:** Docker should be installed on your machine for building Spark images.
- **Spark Distribution:** Download the latest Apache Spark distribution from the official website ([https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)). Choose the pre-built package for Hadoop 3.x or whichever Hadoop version is compatible with your environment.

## Dockerizing Spark

The first step is to create a Docker image for Spark. This involves creating a `Dockerfile` that defines the image's contents. Here's a sample `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV SPARK_VERSION=3.4.1 # Replace with your Spark version
ENV HADOOP_VERSION=3.3 # Replace with your Hadoop version
ENV SCALA_VERSION=2.12

# Download and extract Spark
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-${SPARK_VERSION}/spark-${SPARK_VERSION}-bin-hadoop${HADOOP_VERSION}.tgz -O spark.tgz
RUN tar -xvzf spark.tgz && mv spark-${SPARK_VERSION}-bin-hadoop${HADOOP_VERSION} /spark

# Set SPARK_HOME
ENV SPARK_HOME /spark
ENV PATH $SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Copy application dependencies (if any)
# COPY --chown=1000:1000 your-app-dependencies.jar /spark/jars/

# Expose Spark UI port
EXPOSE 4040

# Define entrypoint for Spark applications (optional)
# ENTRYPOINT ["/spark/bin/spark-submit"]

#WORKDIR /opt/spark/work-dir
```

**Explanation:**

- **`FROM openjdk:8-jdk-slim`**: This line specifies the base image for the Docker image. We use a slim version of OpenJDK 8. Consider using a more recent version of Java depending on your Spark version.
- **`ENV SPARK_VERSION=...`**: This sets environment variables for the Spark version, Hadoop version, and Scala version. _Important:_ Make sure the `HADOOP_VERSION` aligns with the Hadoop version your Spark distribution was built for.
- **`RUN wget ...`**: This downloads the Spark distribution from the Apache archive.
- **`RUN tar ...`**: This extracts the Spark distribution.
- **`ENV SPARK_HOME ...`**: This sets the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable, which is required by Spark.
- **`ENV PATH ...`**: Adds the Spark `bin` directory to the `PATH` variable, allowing you to run Spark commands directly.
- **`COPY ...`**: This is an _optional_ section to copy any dependencies your Spark application needs (e.g., JDBC drivers, custom JARs). Ensure proper permissions.
- **`EXPOSE 4040`**: This exposes port 4040, which is the default port for the Spark UI.
- **`ENTRYPOINT ...`**: This is _optional_. If you want to pre-configure the image to be used primarily for submitting Spark jobs, you can set the `ENTRYPOINT` to `spark-submit`. This will need careful consideration of how you pass application parameters.
- **`WORKDIR`**: Setting the working directory is useful for making file paths shorter within the container.

**Building the Docker Image:**

Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command:

```plaintext
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1 .
```

Replace `your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1` with your Docker Hub username and the desired tag for the image. _Best Practice:_ Tag the image with the Spark version for easy identification and management.

**Pushing the Image to a Registry:**

After building the image, push it to a container registry like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). This makes the image accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.

```plaintext
docker push your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1
```

## Deploying Spark on Kubernetes

There are several ways to deploy Spark on Kubernetes:

1.  **Using `spark-submit` in `cluster` mode:** This is the most common approach. The `spark-submit` command submits the application to the Kubernetes cluster, and the driver runs inside a Kubernetes pod.

2.  **Using the Spark Kubernetes Operator:** The Spark Kubernetes Operator provides a more Kubernetes-native way to deploy and manage Spark applications. It uses Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRDs) to define Spark applications.

3.  **Manual Deployment:** You can manually define Kubernetes Deployments and Services for the Spark driver and executors. This approach provides the most flexibility but requires more configuration.

We will focus on the `spark-submit` method in `cluster` mode as it's the most widely used and straightforward.

## Configuring Spark on Kubernetes

Configuration is key to running Spark efficiently on Kubernetes. Here's a breakdown of the most important configuration options:

### Resource Allocation (CPU, Memory)

You can control the resources allocated to Spark drivers and executors using the following options:

- **`--driver-memory`**: Specifies the amount of memory to allocate to the driver process (e.g., `1g`, `2g`).
- **`--driver-cores`**: Specifies the number of cores to allocate to the driver process (e.g., `1`, `2`).
- **`--executor-memory`**: Specifies the amount of memory to allocate to each executor process (e.g., `1g`, `2g`).
- **`--executor-cores`**: Specifies the number of cores to allocate to each executor process (e.g., `1`, `2`).
- **`--num-executors`**: Specifies the number of executors to launch.

**Example:**

```plaintext
spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --master k8s://kubernetes-api-server-address \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name spark-pi \
  --driver-memory 1g \
  --driver-cores 1 \
  --executor-memory 2g \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --num-executors 3 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=your-namespace \
  /path/to/your/spark-examples_2.12-3.4.1.jar 10
```

**Explanation:**

- **`--master k8s://kubernetes-api-server-address`**: Specifies the Kubernetes master URL. Replace `kubernetes-api-server-address` with the actual address of your Kubernetes API server. For in-cluster deployments, you can often omit this or use `k8s://` which will resolve the service.
- **`--deploy-mode cluster`**: Specifies that the application should be deployed in cluster mode.
- **`--name spark-pi`**: Specifies the name of the application.
- **`--conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1`**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the Spark driver and executors. Replace `your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1` with the actual image name.
- **`--conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=your-namespace`**: Specifies the Kubernetes namespace to deploy the application in. Replace `your-namespace` with the actual namespace.

**Important Considerations for Resource Allocation:**

- **Overhead:** Remember to account for the overhead of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and other processes when allocating memory. It's generally recommended to allocate slightly more memory than the application actually needs. Kubernetes also has its own overhead for pod management.
- **CPU Limits:** Consider setting CPU limits on the driver and executors to prevent them from consuming excessive CPU resources. This can be done using Kubernetes resource limits.
- **Testing:** Experiment with different resource allocations to find the optimal configuration for your application. Monitor the performance of the application and adjust the resources accordingly.

### Dynamic Allocation

Spark's dynamic allocation feature allows you to dynamically add or remove executors based on the workload. This can improve resource utilization and reduce costs. To enable dynamic allocation, set the following configuration options:

- **`spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true`**: Enables dynamic allocation.
- **`spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors`**: Specifies the minimum number of executors to keep running.
- **`spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors`**: Specifies the maximum number of executors to allow.
- **`spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors`**: Specifies the initial number of executors to launch. If not set, it defaults to the same value as `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors`.
- **`spark.shuffle.service.enabled=true`**: Enables the external shuffle service, which is required for dynamic allocation. This service allows executors to be removed without losing shuffle data.
- **`spark.shuffle.service.port`**: The port on which the external shuffle service listens. The default is 7337.
- **`spark.shuffle.service.db.enabled=true`**: Enables storing shuffle metadata in a database (typically Derby) instead of in-memory. This improves the stability of the shuffle service. Consider using a more robust external database for production environments.

**Example:**

```plaintext
spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --master k8s://kubernetes-api-server-address \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name spark-pi-dynamic \
  --driver-memory 1g \
  --driver-cores 1 \
  --executor-memory 2g \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=your-namespace \
  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true \
  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors=1 \
  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors=5 \
  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors=1 \
  --conf spark.shuffle.service.enabled=true \
  --conf spark.shuffle.service.port=7337 \
  --conf spark.shuffle.service.db.enabled=true \
  /path/to/your/spark-examples_2.12-3.4.1.jar 10
```

**Important Considerations for Dynamic Allocation:**

- **Shuffle Service:** The external shuffle service is crucial for dynamic allocation. Ensure that it is properly configured and running.
- **Resource Manager:** Kubernetes acts as the resource manager in this case. Dynamic allocation leverages Kubernetes' ability to provision and deprovision pods based on demand.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor the number of executors being allocated and deallocated to ensure that dynamic allocation is working as expected. Look for metrics related to `dynamicAllocation.executorAllocationTime` and `dynamicAllocation.executorDeallocationTime`.

### Executor Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the executor processes using Spark configuration options. Some common options include:

- **`spark.executor.instances`**: This is deprecated in favor of `--num-executors` and dynamic allocation. Avoid using this option.
- **`spark.executor.memory`**: Already covered under resource allocation.
- **`spark.executor.cores`**: Already covered under resource allocation.
- **`spark.executor.memoryOverhead`**: Amount of off-heap memory to be allocated per executor. This is used for things like JVM overhead and other non-heap allocations.
- **`spark.executor.pyspark.memory`**: Amount of memory to be allocated for PySpark.
- **`spark.executor.extraJavaOptions`**: Extra Java options to pass to the executor JVM. Useful for setting garbage collection parameters or other JVM settings.
- **`spark.executor.extraClassPath`**: Extra class path entries for the executor.
- **`spark.executor.extraLibraryPath`**: Extra library path entries for the executor.
- **`spark.executor.logs.rolling.strategy`**: The strategy for rolling executor logs (e.g., `time`, `size`).

**Example:**

```plaintext
spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --master k8s://kubernetes-api-server-address \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name spark-pi \
  --driver-memory 1g \
  --driver-cores 1 \
  --executor-memory 2g \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --num-executors 3 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=your-namespace \
  --conf spark.executor.memoryOverhead=512m \
  --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions="-XX:+UseG1GC" \
  /path/to/your/spark-examples_2.12-3.4.1.jar 10
```

### Driver Configuration

Similarly to executors, you can configure the driver process using Spark configuration options:

- **`spark.driver.memory`**: Already covered under resource allocation.
- **`spark.driver.cores`**: Already covered under resource allocation.
- **`spark.driver.memoryOverhead`**: Amount of off-heap memory to be allocated per driver.
- **`spark.driver.extraJavaOptions`**: Extra Java options to pass to the driver JVM.
- **`spark.driver.extraClassPath`**: Extra class path entries for the driver.
- **`spark.driver.extraLibraryPath`**: Extra library path entries for the driver.
- **`spark.driver.host`**: The hostname or IP address of the driver. Typically, you don't need to set this manually; Kubernetes will handle it.
- **`spark.driver.port`**: The port on which the driver listens for connections. The default is 7077.

**Example:**

```plaintext
spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --master k8s://kubernetes-api-server-address \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name spark-pi \
  --driver-memory 1g \
  --driver-cores 1 \
  --executor-memory 2g \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --num-executors 3 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=your-namespace \
  --conf spark.driver.memoryOverhead=512m \
  --conf spark.driver.extraJavaOptions="-XX:+UseG1GC" \
  /path/to/your/spark-examples_2.12-3.4.1.jar 10
```

### Networking Considerations

Networking is an important aspect of running Spark on Kubernetes. Consider the following:

- **Service Discovery:** Kubernetes provides service discovery, allowing Spark drivers and executors to discover each other using service names.
- **DNS:** Ensure that DNS is properly configured in your Kubernetes cluster so that Spark components can resolve each other's hostnames.
- **Network Policies:** Use network policies to control the network traffic between Spark components and other services in your cluster. This can improve security and isolation. For example, you might create a policy that only allows traffic from the Spark driver to the Spark executors.
- **Ingress:** If you need to access the Spark UI from outside the cluster, you can use an Ingress controller to expose the Spark UI service.
- **Headless Services:** Headless services can be used for the driver to directly connect to executors without going through a load balancer. This can be useful for reducing latency. To use a headless service, set `spark.kubernetes.driver.service.type` to `ClusterIP` and `spark.kubernetes.driver.service.clusterIP` to `None`.

### Accessing Data (Cloud Storage, HDFS)

Spark applications often need to access data stored in cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), or Azure Blob Storage, or in a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

**Cloud Storage:**

To access data in cloud storage, you need to configure Spark with the appropriate credentials and file system schemes. This typically involves setting the following configuration options:

- **`spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key`**: The access key for Amazon S3 (if using S3).
- **`spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key`**: The secret key for Amazon S3 (if using S3).
- **`spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint`**: The endpoint for Amazon S3 (if using S3). This might be necessary for regions other than us-east-1 or for using MinIO.
- **`spark.hadoop.fs.gs.project.id`**: The project ID for Google Cloud Storage (if using GCS).
- **`spark.hadoop.fs.gs.system.bucket`**: The system bucket for Google Cloud Storage (if using GCS).
- **`spark.hadoop.fs.azure.account.key.<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net`**: The access key for Azure Blob Storage (if using Azure).
- **Credential Providers:** Instead of directly embedding credentials in the configuration, consider using credential providers like the AWS Instance Profile or Kubernetes Secrets to manage credentials more securely.

**Example (S3 with access key and secret key - NOT RECOMMENDED for production):**

```plaintext
spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --master k8s://kubernetes-api-server-address \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name spark-pi-s3 \
  --driver-memory 1g \
  --driver-cores 1 \
  --executor-memory 2g \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --num-executors 3 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=your-namespace \
  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY \
  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY \
  --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint=s3.amazonaws.com \
  /path/to/your/spark-examples_2.12-3.4.1.jar 10
```

**Example (S3 with AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) - RECOMMENDED for production):**

1.  **Create an IAM Role:** Create an IAM role with permissions to access the S3 bucket.

2.  **Create a Kubernetes Service Account:** Create a Kubernetes service account.

3.  **Annotate the Service Account:** Annotate the service account with the IAM role ARN. This is typically done using the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation for EKS.

4.  **Configure `spark-submit`:** Configure `spark-submit` to use the service account.

```plaintext
spark-submit \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --master k8s://kubernetes-api-server-address \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name spark-pi-s3-irsa \
  --driver-memory 1g \
  --driver-cores 1 \
  --executor-memory 2g \
  --executor-cores 2 \
  --num-executors 3 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=your-dockerhub-username/spark:3.4.1 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=your-namespace \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName=your-service-account \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.executor.serviceAccountName=your-service-account \
  /path/to/your/spark-examples_2.12-3.4.1.jar 10
```

**HDFS:**

To access data in HDFS, you need to ensure that the Spark driver and executors can connect to the HDFS NameNode and DataNodes. This typically involves:

- **Including Hadoop Configuration:** Include the `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` files from your Hadoop installation in the Spark driver and executor classpaths. You can copy these files into the Spark image or mount them as volumes.
- **DNS Resolution:** Ensure that the hostnames of the NameNode and DataNodes are resolvable from within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Kerberos Authentication:** If HDFS is Kerberos-enabled, you need to configure Kerberos authentication for the Spark driver and executors.

**Important Considerations for Data Access:**

- **Security:** Never store credentials directly in your code or configuration files. Use secure methods like credential providers or Kubernetes Secrets to manage credentials.
- **Performance:** Consider the network bandwidth and latency between your Spark cluster and the data source. Optimize data access patterns to minimize network traffic. For example, use data locality to read data from DataNodes that are close to the Spark executors.
- **Serialization:** Use efficient serialization formats like Apache Parquet or Apache ORC to improve data read and write performance.

## Submitting Spark Applications

Once you have configured Spark on Kubernetes, you can submit Spark applications using the `spark-submit` command. Here's a general example:

```plaintext
spark-submit \
  --class <your_main_class> \
  --master k8s://<kubernetes_api_server_address> \
  --deploy-mode cluster \
  --name <your_application_name> \
  --driver-memory <driver_memory> \
  --driver-cores <driver_cores> \
  --executor-memory <executor_memory> \
  --executor-cores <executor_cores> \
  --num-executors <num_executors> \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=<your_docker_image> \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=<your_kubernetes_namespace> \
  <path_to_your_spark_application_jar> <application_arguments>
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for your application.

**Key Parameters:**

- **`--class`**: The main class of your Spark application.
- **`--master`**: The Kubernetes master URL.
- **`--deploy-mode`**: `cluster` for deploying the driver inside the Kubernetes cluster.
- **`--name`**: The name of your Spark application.
- **`--driver-memory`**: The amount of memory to allocate to the driver.
- **`--driver-cores`**: The number of cores to allocate to the driver.
- **`--executor-memory`**: The amount of memory to allocate to each executor.
- **`--executor-cores`**: The number of cores to allocate to each executor.
- **`--num-executors`**: The number of executors to launch.
- **`--conf spark.kubernetes.container.image`**: The Docker image to use for the driver and executors.
- **`--conf spark.kubernetes.namespace`**: The Kubernetes namespace to deploy the application in.
- **`<path_to_your_spark_application_jar>`**: The path to your Spark application JAR file.
- **`<application_arguments>`**: Any arguments that need to be passed to your Spark application.

## Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are essential for troubleshooting and optimizing Spark applications.

**Monitoring:**

- **Spark UI:** The Spark UI provides detailed information about the application's execution, including resource usage, task progress, and DAG visualization. Access the Spark UI through port forwarding or by exposing the Spark UI service using an Ingress controller.
- **Kubernetes Dashboard:** The Kubernetes dashboard provides information about the overall health of the cluster, including pod status, resource usage, and events.
- **Metrics Server:** The Metrics Server collects resource usage metrics from Kubernetes nodes and pods. This data can be used to monitor the performance of Spark applications.
- **Prometheus and Grafana:** You can use Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize Spark metrics and Kubernetes metrics. This allows you to create custom dashboards and alerts.

**Logging:**

- **Spark Logs:** Spark logs are written to the standard output and standard error streams of the driver and executor processes. These logs can be collected using Kubernetes logging mechanisms.
- **Kubernetes Logging:** Kubernetes provides various logging mechanisms, including:
  - **stdout/stderr:** Logs written to the standard output and standard error streams of the containers.
  - **Filebeat:** A lightweight shipper that can collect logs from files and forward them to Elasticsearch or other log aggregation systems.
  - **Fluentd:** A data collector that can collect logs from various sources and forward them to different destinations.
- **Log Aggregation Systems:** Use a log aggregation system like Elasticsearch, Splunk, or Graylog to collect, index, and analyze Spark logs. This makes it easier to troubleshoot issues and identify performance bottlenecks.

**Important Considerations for Monitoring and Logging:**

- **Retention:** Configure log retention policies to prevent logs from filling up disk space.
- **Aggregation:** Use a log aggregation system to centralize logs and make them easier to search and analyze.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts to notify you of potential issues, such as high resource usage or application failures.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter when running Spark on Kubernetes and how to troubleshoot them:

- **ImagePullBackOff:** This error indicates that Kubernetes is unable to pull the Docker image. Verify that the image name is correct and that the image is accessible from the Kubernetes cluster. Check your image pull secrets.
- **ContainerCreating:** This error indicates that Kubernetes is unable to create the container. Check the Kubernetes events for more details. This might be due to resource constraints or other issues.
- **Executor Lost:** This error indicates that an executor has been lost. Check the executor logs for more details. This might be due to resource exhaustion, network issues, or application errors.
- **Driver Failed:** This error indicates that the driver has failed. Check the driver logs for more details. This might be due to application errors or resource exhaustion.
- **Connection Refused:** This error indicates that the driver or executors are unable to connect to each other. Verify that the network configuration is correct and that the DNS resolution is working.
- **Out of Memory Error:** This error indicates that the driver or executors are running out of memory. Increase the memory allocation for the driver or executors. Analyze your application to identify memory leaks or inefficient data structures.
- **Permission Denied:** This error indicates that the driver or executors do not have the necessary permissions to access data or resources. Verify that the IAM roles and permissions are correctly configured.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

- **Check the Logs:** The logs are your best friend when troubleshooting Spark applications on Kubernetes. Check the logs for the driver, executors, and Kubernetes events.
- **Simplify the Application:** If you are having trouble with a complex application, try simplifying it to isolate the issue.
- **Increase Logging Level:** Increase the logging level to get more detailed information about what is happening. You can set the logging level using the `spark.driver.log.level` and `spark.executor.log.level` configuration options.
- **Use Debugging Tools:** Use debugging tools like the Spark UI and the Kubernetes dashboard to monitor the application's execution and identify potential issues.
- **Consult the Documentation:** The Apache Spark documentation and the Kubernetes documentation provide a wealth of information about configuring and troubleshooting Spark on Kubernetes.

## Best Practices
