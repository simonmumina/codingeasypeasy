# Tomcat vs Jetty: A Deep Dive into Java Servlet Containers - Key Differences & Choosing the Right One

When developing Java web applications, choosing the right servlet container is crucial for performance, scalability, and maintainability. Tomcat and Jetty are two of the most popular options, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This article provides a comprehensive comparison of Tomcat and Jetty, exploring their key differences and helping you make an informed decision.

## What are Tomcat and Jetty?

Both Tomcat and Jetty are open-source servlet containers that implement the Java Servlet specification and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) specification. They provide the runtime environment for Java web applications, handling HTTP requests and responses, managing sessions, and providing other essential services.

*   **Tomcat (Apache Tomcat):**  A robust and widely-used web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is known for its comprehensive features, mature ecosystem, and strong community support.

*   **Jetty:** A lightweight and highly embeddable web server and servlet container developed by Eclipse. It is favored for its speed, flexibility, and small footprint.

## Key Differences: Tomcat vs. Jetty

While both Tomcat and Jetty serve a similar purpose, their underlying architectures and design philosophies lead to significant differences in their characteristics:

### 1. Architecture: Threading Model & Design Philosophy

*   **Tomcat:** Employs a thread-per-connection model. Each incoming request is handled by a dedicated thread. Tomcat is a full-fledged web server, offering features like virtual hosts, load balancing, and management consoles. It prioritizes stability and feature richness.

*   **Jetty:** Uses a more efficient asynchronous I/O and thread pool approach.  It utilizes a smaller number of threads to handle a larger volume of concurrent requests. Jetty is designed to be highly modular and embeddable, making it suitable for various use cases, including embedded applications and high-concurrency environments. It prioritizes performance and resource utilization.

**Code Example (Simplified Threading Illustration):**

Although not directly exposing the internal thread management, you can see differences in how you configure the thread pools:

**Tomcat (server.xml - connector configuration):**

```xml
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443"
           maxThreads="200"
           minSpareThreads="10"
           acceptCount="100" />
```

This configures the main connector to handle HTTP traffic.  `maxThreads` sets the maximum number of threads Tomcat will use to handle requests. `minSpareThreads` specifies the minimum number of threads kept alive and ready.

**Jetty (jetty.xml - thread pool configuration):**

```xml
<Configure id="Server" class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server">
    <Call name="addConnector">
        <Arg>
            <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.ServerConnector">
                <Arg name="server"><Ref refid="Server"/></Arg>
                <Set name="port"><Property name="jetty.http.port" default="8080" /></Set>
                <Set name="idleTimeout">30000</Set>
                <Set name="acceptors">2</Set>
                <Set name="selectorThreads">4</Set>
            </New>
        </Arg>
    </Call>

    <!-- Thread Pool Configuration -->
    <New id="threadpool" class="org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.QueuedThreadPool">
        <Set name="minThreads">8</Set>
        <Set name="maxThreads">200</Set>
        <Set name="idleTimeout">60000</Set>
    </New>
    <Set name="threadPool"><Ref refid="threadpool"/></Set>

</Configure>
```

Here, you directly configure the thread pool used by the server. `minThreads`, `maxThreads`, and `idleTimeout` control the size and behavior of the thread pool.  `acceptors` and `selectorThreads` are also important performance tunables related to how Jetty handles incoming connections.  Jetty's configuration allows more fine-grained control.

**Key takeaway:**  While both use thread pools, Jetty's architecture is designed around asynchronous, non-blocking I/O for higher concurrency with fewer threads.  Tomcat's default is a more straightforward thread-per-connection model, which can be simpler to understand but potentially less scalable under heavy load without careful tuning.

### 2. Performance: Speed and Resource Utilization

*   **Jetty:** Generally exhibits faster startup times and lower memory footprint compared to Tomcat. Its asynchronous I/O model enables it to handle a higher number of concurrent requests with fewer resources, particularly under heavy load.

*   **Tomcat:** Performance is good, but requires more resources, particularly memory, due to its thread-per-connection model.  Proper tuning, such as adjusting thread pool size, is crucial for optimal performance.

### 3. Embeddability: Integration into Applications

*   **Jetty:** Designed for embeddability. It can be easily integrated into Java applications as a library. This is particularly useful for microservices, testing frameworks, and applications requiring a lightweight web server.

**Code Example (Embedding Jetty in a Java application):**

```java
import org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server;
import org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler;
import org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

public class EmbeddedJettyExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Server server = new Server(8080);

        ServletContextHandler context = new ServletContextHandler(ServletContextHandler.SESSIONS);
        context.setContextPath("/");
        server.setHandler(context);

        context.addServlet(new ServletHolder(new MyServlet()), "/*");

        server.start();
        server.join();
    }

    public static class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
        @Override
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
            response.setContentType("text/html");
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
            response.getWriter().println("<h1>Hello from embedded Jetty!</h1>");
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to embed Jetty within a Java application. The `Server` object represents the Jetty server instance.  A `ServletContextHandler` is used to define the context path (in this case, the root path `/`) and to register servlets. The `MyServlet` class is a simple servlet that responds to GET requests.

*   **Tomcat:** While Tomcat can also be embedded, it's generally more complex to configure and integrate. Tomcat is typically deployed as a standalone server.

### 4. Configuration and Management: Ease of Use

*   **Tomcat:**  Uses XML-based configuration files (`server.xml`, `web.xml`). While powerful, this can be more complex than Jetty's configuration approach. Tomcat provides a web-based management console for monitoring and administering the server.

*   **Jetty:** Can be configured using XML, Java code, or programmatically. It's known for its flexible and streamlined configuration options. While it doesn't have a built-in web-based management console like Tomcat, tools and libraries exist to manage and monitor Jetty instances.

### 5. Spring Boot Integration

*   **Jetty:** Spring Boot provides excellent support for Jetty. You can easily switch between Tomcat and Jetty as your embedded server with minimal configuration changes.

*   **Tomcat:** Tomcat is the default embedded server for Spring Boot.  The integration is seamless and requires minimal effort.

**Code Example (Spring Boot - changing to Jetty):**

To switch from Tomcat to Jetty in a Spring Boot application, exclude the Tomcat dependency and include the Jetty dependency in your `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle):

**Maven (pom.xml):**

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
        </exclusions>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Gradle (build.gradle):**

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web') {
        exclude group: 'org.springframework.boot', module: 'spring-boot-starter-tomcat'
    }
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jetty'
}
```

Spring Boot automatically configures and manages Jetty when it's included in the project.  No further code changes are usually needed.

### 6. Community and Documentation

*   **Tomcat:** Has a large and active community with extensive documentation, tutorials, and online resources. This makes it easier to find solutions to common problems and get help when needed.

*   **Jetty:** Also has a strong community, but the community size might be smaller than Tomcat's. The documentation is comprehensive and well-maintained.

### 7. Licensing

Both Tomcat and Jetty are licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution, even for commercial purposes.
