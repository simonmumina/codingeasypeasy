# How to Check if Your JavaScript Code is Running in Node.js (with Examples)

Writing JavaScript code that can run in both a browser and a Node.js environment offers great flexibility and code reusability. However, sometimes you need to know *where* your code is executing. This is because certain APIs and functionalities are exclusive to either the browser (like the `window` object) or Node.js (like the `fs` module). This article explores several reliable ways to determine if your JavaScript code is running in a Node.js environment.

## Why Check the Environment?

Before diving into the how, let's understand the *why*.  Detecting the runtime environment (Node.js or Browser) is crucial for:

*   **Conditional Logic:**  Executing different code branches based on the environment.  For example, using `fetch` in the browser and `node-fetch` in Node.js for making HTTP requests.
*   **Avoiding Errors:** Preventing `ReferenceError` exceptions when trying to access browser-specific APIs in Node.js or vice versa.
*   **Portability:** Writing more portable code that adapts to its surroundings.
*   **Feature Detection:** Enabling or disabling features based on the availability of certain APIs (e.g., using WebSockets in the browser and socket.io in Node.js).
*   **Module Compatibility:** Choosing the right module or package based on the runtime.

## Methods for Detecting Node.js

Here are several methods, ordered by their general reliability and common usage:

### 1. Checking for `process.versions`

The most reliable and widely recommended approach is to check for the existence of the `process` object and its `versions` property. This property is specific to Node.js and provides information about the Node.js version.

```javascript
function isNode() {
  return (typeof process !== 'undefined') && (typeof process.versions !== 'undefined');
}

if (isNode()) {
  console.log('Running in Node.js');
  // Access Node.js specific APIs here, like 'fs' or 'path'
  const fs = require('fs');
  fs.writeFileSync('node-file.txt', 'Hello from Node.js!');
} else {
  console.log('Running in a browser');
  // Access browser-specific APIs here, like 'window' or 'document'
  alert('Hello from the browser!');
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   `typeof process !== 'undefined'` checks if the `process` object is defined. The `process` object is a global object in Node.js, providing information about the current Node.js process. It's not available in browser environments.
*   `typeof process.versions !== 'undefined'` further confirms that it's a Node.js environment. The `versions` property within the `process` object contains information about Node.js, V8, and other related components.

**Benefits:**

*   **Highly Reliable:** This method is less susceptible to false positives compared to other techniques.
*   **Standard Practice:** It's the most common and recommended way to detect Node.js.

### 2. Checking for the `process` Object Directly

A slightly less specific, but still useful, approach is to check only for the `process` object itself.

```javascript
function isNodeProcess() {
  return typeof process !== 'undefined';
}

if (isNodeProcess()) {
  console.log("Running in Node.js");
  // ... Node.js specific code
} else {
  console.log("Not running in Node.js");
  // ... Browser specific code
}
```

**Explanation:**

This method only checks if the `process` object exists.

**Considerations:**

*   **Less Specific:** While generally reliable, there's a (very small) chance that a browser environment might define a `process` object for other purposes (though this is highly unlikely).
*   **Shorter Code:**  It's slightly more concise.

### 3. Checking for Node.js Modules (e.g., `require`)

Another approach, often used as a fallback, is to check for the existence of Node.js-specific modules, such as `require`. This method relies on the fact that `require` is a function available only in Node.js environments (outside of module bundlers).

```javascript
function isNodeRequire() {
  return typeof require === 'function';
}

if (isNodeRequire()) {
  console.log("Running in Node.js");
  // ... Node.js specific code
} else {
  console.log("Not running in Node.js");
  // ... Browser specific code
}
```

**Explanation:**

This checks if `require` is a function.

**Considerations:**

*   **Potential Issues with Module Bundlers:** Modern module bundlers like Webpack or Parcel can inject a `require` function into the browser environment for module loading. This can lead to false positives. However, even with bundlers, checking `process.versions` remains more reliable.
*   **Less Recommended:** Generally, the `process.versions` check is preferred over this method.

### 4. Checking for `module.exports`

This method checks for the existence of `module.exports`, a common pattern for exporting modules in Node.js.

```javascript
function isNodeModuleExports() {
    return typeof module !== 'undefined' && typeof module.exports !== 'undefined';
}

if (isNodeModuleExports()) {
    console.log('Running in Node.js');
    // ... Node.js specific code
} else {
    console.log('Running in a browser or other environment');
    // ... Browser specific code
}
```

**Explanation:**

This checks if the `module` object and its `exports` property exist.

**Considerations:**

*   **Less reliable:** Similar to checking for `require`, module bundlers can make this check unreliable.
*   **Generally Not Recommended:**  The `process.versions` check is the preferred method.

## Choosing the Right Method

For most use cases, **checking for `process.versions` is the most reliable and recommended approach.** It's less likely to produce false positives compared to other methods, especially when working with module bundlers.

If, for some reason, you need a more concise check and are confident that module bundlers won't interfere, checking for the `process` object directly can be a viable alternative.

Avoid relying solely on checks for `require` or `module.exports` as these are more prone to errors in modern development environments.

## Putting it All Together: A Practical Example

Let's create a function that handles HTTP requests differently based on the environment:

```javascript
function fetchData(url) {
  if (typeof process !== 'undefined' && typeof process.versions !== 'undefined') {
    // Node.js environment - use 'node-fetch'
    const fetch = require('node-fetch');
    return fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json());
  } else {
    // Browser environment - use the built-in 'fetch' API
    return fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json());
  }
}

// Example usage:
fetchData('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

**Explanation:**

This code demonstrates how to conditionally load a different `fetch` implementation based on the environment.  In Node.js, it uses the `node-fetch` package (which you'd need to install), while in the browser, it uses the browser's built-in `fetch` API.

## Conclusion

Detecting the runtime environment (Node.js or Browser) is a fundamental skill for writing portable and adaptable JavaScript code. By using the methods described in this article, particularly the `process.versions` check, you can confidently determine where your code is running and execute appropriate code branches accordingly. This will help you avoid errors, improve code reusability, and create more robust applications. Remember to choose the method that best suits your specific needs and development environment.
