# API Versioning in FastAPI: Best Practices and Implementation (v1, v2)

As your API evolves, you'll inevitably need to make changes.  These changes might be improvements, bug fixes, or even entirely new features.  However, directly modifying a live API can break existing clients who rely on the old behavior.  This is where API versioning comes into play.  API versioning allows you to introduce changes without impacting existing clients, ensuring a smooth transition and a stable API.  This post will explore how to implement API versioning in FastAPI, specifically focusing on path-based versioning using prefixes like `/v1/` and `/v2/`.

## Why API Versioning is Crucial

Before diving into the implementation, let's briefly recap why API versioning is essential:

*   **Backward Compatibility:**  Versioning allows you to maintain older API versions while introducing new ones. Existing clients can continue using the old version, while new clients can leverage the latest version.
*   **Controlled Rollout:**  You can gradually introduce changes and monitor their impact without affecting your entire user base.
*   **Clear Communication:**  Versioning provides a clear indication of which API version a client is using, enabling better communication and troubleshooting.
*   **Flexibility:**  Versioning gives you the flexibility to make significant changes to your API without being constrained by backward compatibility concerns.

## Common API Versioning Strategies

There are several approaches to API versioning. The most common are:

*   **Path-based versioning:** Using prefixes in the URL path (e.g., `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`). This is the strategy we'll focus on.
*   **Header-based versioning:** Using a custom HTTP header (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json`).
*   **Query parameter-based versioning:**  Using a query parameter (e.g., `/users?version=1`).
*   **Media type versioning (Content Negotiation):**  Using the `Accept` header to specify the desired version.

While each strategy has its pros and cons, path-based versioning is often preferred for its simplicity, discoverability, and ease of implementation.

## Implementing Path-Based API Versioning in FastAPI

Let's explore how to implement path-based API versioning in FastAPI.

**1. Basic Structure:**

We'll start by creating two separate routers for different API versions.  Each router will contain the endpoints specific to that version.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter

app = FastAPI()

# Router for API version 1
router_v1 = APIRouter(prefix="/v1")

# Router for API version 2
router_v2 = APIRouter(prefix="/v2")

# Include the routers in the main app
app.include_router(router_v1)
app.include_router(router_v2)
```

In this example, we've defined two routers, `router_v1` and `router_v2`, each with a different prefix. The `app.include_router()` function then incorporates these routers into the main FastAPI application.

**2. Defining Endpoints for Each Version:**

Now, let's define some simple endpoints within each router.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter

app = FastAPI()

# Router for API version 1
router_v1 = APIRouter(prefix="/v1")

@router_v1.get("/users")
async def get_users_v1():
    """Returns a list of users (version 1)."""
    return [{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe"}]

@router_v1.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user_v1(user_id: int):
    """Returns a specific user (version 1)."""
    return {"id": user_id, "name": f"User {user_id}"}


# Router for API version 2
router_v2 = APIRouter(prefix="/v2")

@router_v2.get("/users")
async def get_users_v2():
    """Returns a list of users (version 2), including their email."""
    return [{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}]

@router_v2.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user_v2(user_id: int):
    """Returns a specific user (version 2), including their email."""
    return {"id": user_id, "name": f"User {user_id}", "email": f"user{user_id}@example.com"}



# Include the routers in the main app
app.include_router(router_v1)
app.include_router(router_v2)
```

Notice how the `/users` endpoint in `v2` includes the user's email, while `v1` only returns the ID and name. This demonstrates how you can introduce new fields or modify the API's behavior without affecting clients using `v1`.

**3. Running the Application:**

Save the code to a file, say `main.py`, and run it using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Now, you can access the endpoints:

*   `http://localhost:8000/v1/users` - Returns users (v1)
*   `http://localhost:8000/v1/users/1` - Returns user with ID 1 (v1)
*   `http://localhost:8000/v2/users` - Returns users including email (v2)
*   `http://localhost:8000/v2/users/1` - Returns user with ID 1 including email (v2)

**4. Handling Deprecated Versions:**

As you introduce newer versions, you might eventually want to deprecate older ones. You can handle this in several ways:

*   **Returning an Error:** You can return a `410 Gone` or `400 Bad Request` error for deprecated versions.

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter, HTTPException

    app = FastAPI()

    router_v1 = APIRouter(prefix="/v1")

    @router_v1.get("/users")
    async def get_users_v1():
        raise HTTPException(status_code=410, detail="API version 1 is deprecated.")

    app.include_router(router_v1)

    router_v2 = APIRouter(prefix="/v2")

    @router_v2.get("/users")
    async def get_users_v2():
        return [{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}]

    app.include_router(router_v2)
    ```

*   **Redirecting:**  You can redirect requests to the latest version.  This is less common but can be useful in some cases.

*   **Returning a Warning:**  You can include a `Deprecation` header in the response, warning clients that the version is deprecated.

**5. Documenting Your API Versions (Swagger UI):**

FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI documentation (Swagger UI) based on your code.  However, to make the documentation more informative, you can add descriptions to your routers.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter

app = FastAPI()

router_v1 = APIRouter(prefix="/v1", tags=["Users"], description="API Version 1")

@router_v1.get("/users")
async def get_users_v1():
    return [{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe"}]

app.include_router(router_v1)

router_v2 = APIRouter(prefix="/v2", tags=["Users"], description="API Version 2")

@router_v2.get("/users")
async def get_users_v2():
    return [{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}]

app.include_router(router_v2)
```

By adding the `description` parameter to the `APIRouter`, you can provide a clear explanation of each API version in the Swagger UI.  You can access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

**6. Centralized Version Management (Optional):**

For larger projects, consider creating a centralized module to manage your API versions and related constants.  This can help to keep your code organized and maintainable.

```python
# api_versions.py
API_VERSION_1 = "v1"
API_VERSION_2 = "v2"

# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter
from api_versions import API_VERSION_1, API_VERSION_2

app = FastAPI()

router_v1 = APIRouter(prefix=f"/{API_VERSION_1}")
router_v2 = APIRouter(prefix=f"/{API_VERSION_2}")

# ... (endpoint definitions)

app.include_router(router_v1)
app.include_router(router_v2)
```

## Best Practices for API Versioning in FastAPI

*   **Choose a Consistent Strategy:**  Stick to one versioning strategy throughout your API.  Mixing different strategies can lead to confusion.
*   **Document Everything:**  Clearly document your API versions, including any breaking changes.  Use Swagger UI or other documentation tools.
*   **Plan for Deprecation:**  Have a plan for deprecating older versions.  Communicate the deprecation timeline to your users well in advance.
*   **Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for Major Changes:** If introducing breaking changes follow Semantic Versioning, increasing the major version number.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test each API version independently to ensure that it functions correctly.
*   **Consider a Gateway or Load Balancer:** For complex deployments, a gateway or load balancer can simplify routing requests to the correct API version.
*   **Communicate Changes:** Clearly communicate API changes to your users through release notes, documentation updates, and announcements.

## Conclusion

API versioning is a crucial aspect of building and maintaining robust APIs. By implementing path-based versioning in FastAPI, you can introduce changes without breaking existing clients, ensuring a smooth and stable API experience. Remember to choose a consistent strategy, document your versions thoroughly, and plan for deprecation to effectively manage your API's evolution. The examples provided here should give you a solid foundation for implementing API versioning in your FastAPI projects. Good luck!
