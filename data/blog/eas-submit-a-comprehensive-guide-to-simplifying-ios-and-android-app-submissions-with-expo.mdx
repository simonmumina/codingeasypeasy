# EAS Submit: A Comprehensive Guide to Simplifying iOS and Android App Submissions with Expo

Submitting your iOS and Android applications to the respective app stores can be a daunting and time-consuming process.  Expo Application Services (EAS) Submit simplifies this process, automating many of the tedious steps and providing a more streamlined experience. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of using EAS Submit to submit your Expo-based React Native apps to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, covering configuration, best practices, and troubleshooting.

## What is EAS Submit?

EAS Submit is a service within the Expo Application Services (EAS) ecosystem that automates the process of building and submitting your React Native apps to the iOS App Store and Google Play Store. It handles tasks such as:

*   **Building your app:**  Automatically builds your app based on your configuration.
*   **Credential management:** Manages the necessary credentials (API keys, certificates, provisioning profiles, etc.) for app submission.
*   **Submission process:** Submits your app to the respective app stores, handling potential errors and retries.
*   **Notifications:** Provides notifications on the progress of your submission.

By using EAS Submit, you can focus on developing your app rather than spending time on the complex and often frustrating submission process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **An Expo account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [https://expo.dev/](https://expo.dev/)
*   **An Expo project:** You should have an existing Expo React Native project. If not, create one using `npx create-expo-app my-app`.
*   **Expo CLI:**  Install the Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`.
*   **EAS CLI:** Install the EAS CLI globally using `npm install -g eas-cli`.  Make sure to log in using `eas login`.
*   **Apple Developer Account (for iOS):** You'll need an active Apple Developer Program membership to submit to the App Store.
*   **Google Play Developer Account (for Android):**  You'll need a Google Play Developer account to submit to the Play Store.

## Setting Up EAS Submit

1.  **Initialize EAS:**

    If you haven't already, initialize EAS in your project:

    ```bash
    eas init
    ```

    This will create an `eas.json` file in your project root. This file configures your builds, submits, and other EAS features.

2.  **Configure `eas.json` for Submission:**

    The `eas.json` file needs to be configured for submission.  Here's a basic example:

    ```json
    {
      "build": {
        "production": {
          "android": {
            "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
          },
          "ios": {
            "scheme": "YourAppScheme", // Replace with your Xcode scheme name
            "buildConfiguration": "Release" //  Or "Debug" if you are submitting a TestFlight build
          }
        }
      },
      "submit": {
        "production": {}
      }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   **`build.production`:** Defines the build configuration for your production builds.
    *   **`build.production.android`:**  Specifies the Gradle command for building the Android release APK.
    *   **`build.production.ios`:** Specifies the Xcode scheme and build configuration for building the iOS app.  **Important:** Replace `"YourAppScheme"` with the actual name of your Xcode scheme. This is the scheme that Xcode uses to manage your builds.  You can find this in Xcode under `Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes`.  The `buildConfiguration` is typically "Release" for production submissions, and often "Debug" for TestFlight builds.
    *   **`submit.production`:** This is where you can further customize the submission process, such as providing specific metadata for your app stores.  We'll delve into this later.

3.  **Configure App Credentials (for iOS):**

    EAS needs access to your Apple Developer Account to manage certificates and provisioning profiles.  You can configure this in several ways:

    *   **Automatic (Recommended):**  EAS can automatically manage your certificates and provisioning profiles. To enable this, you'll need to create an App Store Connect API key with the "App Manager" role.

        *   Go to App Store Connect ([https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)).
        *   Navigate to "Users and Access" > "API Keys".
        *   Click the "+" button to create a new API key.
        *   Give the key a descriptive name, select the "App Manager" role, and download the key.
        *   Use the EAS CLI to configure your Apple credentials:

            ```bash
            eas credentials
            ```

            Follow the prompts.  It will ask for your Apple ID, password, team ID, and the API key information (key ID, issuer ID, and the actual key content).  Keep the key file safe!

    *   **Manual:** You can manually create and manage your certificates and provisioning profiles in the Apple Developer Portal and upload them to EAS. This is a more complex process and is generally not recommended unless you have specific reasons for doing so.  Consult the Expo documentation for details on this method.

    **Note:** If you are using managed credentials for your app, EAS will automatically handle code signing. If you are using your own certificates and profiles, ensure they are correctly configured in your Expo project (specifically, in your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file).

4.  **Configure App Credentials (for Android):**

    For Android, you'll need to configure your keystore to sign your APK.

    *   **Generate a Keystore:**  If you don't have one already, generate a new keystore using the `keytool` command.  This is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

        ```bash
        keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-app.keystore -alias my-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
        ```

        Replace `my-app.keystore` and `my-alias` with your desired keystore name and alias.  You'll be prompted for a password and other information.  **Keep your keystore and password secure!** Losing them will make it impossible to update your app in the Play Store.

    *   **Upload the Keystore to EAS:**  Use the EAS CLI to upload your keystore:

        ```bash
        eas secret:create --name GOOGLE_PLAY_KEYSTORE --value "$(cat my-app.keystore | base64)"
        eas secret:create --name GOOGLE_PLAY_KEYSTORE_ALIAS --value "my-alias"
        eas secret:create --name GOOGLE_PLAY_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD --value "your_keystore_password"
        eas secret:create --name GOOGLE_PLAY_KEY_PASSWORD --value "your_key_password"
        ```

        Replace `my-app.keystore`, `my-alias`, `your_keystore_password`, and `your_key_password` with your actual keystore file, alias, and passwords.

        **Note:** The keystore is base64 encoded before being stored as a secret.  This is a security best practice.

    *   **Configure `eas.json` to use the Keystore Secrets:**  Modify your `eas.json` file to reference the keystore secrets:

        ```json
        {
          "build": {
            "production": {
              "android": {
                "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease",
                "keystoreAlias": "$GOOGLE_PLAY_KEYSTORE_ALIAS",
                "keystorePassword": "$GOOGLE_PLAY_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD",
                "keyPassword": "$GOOGLE_PLAY_KEY_PASSWORD",
                "keystoreBase64": "$GOOGLE_PLAY_KEYSTORE"
              }
            }
          },
          "submit": {
            "production": {}
          }
        }
        ```

        **Important:** By using environment variables like `$GOOGLE_PLAY_KEYSTORE_ALIAS`, etc., you avoid storing sensitive information directly in your `eas.json` file.

## Submitting Your App

1.  **Build Your App:**

    Use the EAS CLI to build your app:

    ```bash
    eas build -p ios --profile production
    eas build -p android --profile production
    ```

    These commands will build your iOS and Android apps using the "production" profile defined in your `eas.json` file.  EAS will handle the build process in the cloud. You can monitor the build progress in the Expo dashboard `([https://expo.dev/accounts/<your_account>/projects/<your_project>/builds](https://expo.dev/accounts/<your_account>/projects/<your_project>/builds))`.

2.  **Submit Your App:**

    Once the builds are complete, use the EAS CLI to submit your app:

    ```bash
    eas submit -p ios --latest
    eas submit -p android --latest
    ```

    *   `-p ios` or `-p android`: Specifies the platform to submit to.
    *   `--latest`:  Submits the latest build for the specified platform. You can also specify a build ID if you want to submit a specific build.

    EAS Submit will then:

    *   Download the built app (IPA for iOS, APK or AAB for Android).
    *   Validate the app.
    *   Upload the app to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
    *   Handle authentication and credential management.
    *   Provide progress updates.

    You'll receive notifications about the submission status.

## Customizing the Submission Process

You can customize the submission process using the `submit.production` section of your `eas.json` file.  Here are some common customizations:

*   **Metadata:** You can provide metadata (such as app name, description, keywords, screenshots, and promo text) directly in `eas.json`.  This avoids having to manually enter this information in App Store Connect and Google Play Console.

    ```json
    {
      "submit": {
        "production": {
          "ios": {
            "appleId": "your_apple_id",
            "ascApiKeyPath": "./path/to/your/asc-api-key.p8",
            "appMetadata": {
              "name": "My Awesome App",
              "description": "A detailed description of your app.",
              "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
              "releaseNotes": "What's new in this version?"
            }
          },
          "android": {
            "serviceAccountJsonPath": "./path/to/your/service-account.json",
            "track": "production", // Or "beta", "alpha", "internal"
            "releaseStatus": "completed" // Or "draft", "inProgress", "halted"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   **`ios.appleId`:** Your Apple ID.
    *   **`ios.ascApiKeyPath`:**  Path to your App Store Connect API key.
    *   **`ios.appMetadata`:** Contains metadata for your iOS app.
    *   **`android.serviceAccountJsonPath`:** Path to your Google Play Service Account JSON key.  This is required for automated submissions to the Play Store. See below for setting up the Google Play Service Account.
    *   **`android.track`:** The Google Play track to upload to (e.g., "production", "beta").
    *   **`android.releaseStatus`:** The release status for the upload.

*   **Google Play Service Account:**  To automate submissions to the Google Play Store, you'll need to create a Google Play Service Account.

    *   Go to the Google Play Console ([https://play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console)).
    *   Navigate to "API access" > "Service accounts".
    *   Create a new service account.
    *   Grant the service account the necessary permissions (e.g., "Release Manager").
    *   Download the service account JSON key.

    **Security Note:** Store the service account JSON key securely and never commit it to your repository.

## Best Practices

*   **Use EAS Secrets:**  Store sensitive information (API keys, keystore passwords, etc.) as EAS secrets to avoid exposing them in your code or configuration files.
*   **Automate Your Workflow:** Integrate EAS Submit into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and submission process.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Test your app thoroughly on both iOS and Android devices before submitting to the app stores.
*   **Follow App Store Guidelines:**  Adhere to the Apple App Store Review Guidelines and the Google Play Developer Program Policies.
*   **Monitor Submission Status:**  Regularly check the status of your submissions in the Expo dashboard and the respective app store consoles.
*   **Use different EAS profiles for development and production builds.** This helps in maintaining separate configurations and secrets for different environments.
*   **Increment build numbers automatically.** This ensures that each submission is treated as a unique version by the app stores.  You can use `expo-updates` to manage build numbers automatically.
*   **Properly configure environment variables for different build profiles.** For example, you might have different API endpoints for development and production.
*   **Regularly update your Expo SDK and dependencies.** This ensures that you are using the latest features and security patches.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Build Errors:** If your build fails, check the build logs in the Expo dashboard for error messages.  Common causes include incorrect configuration in `eas.json`, missing dependencies, or code errors.
*   **Submission Errors:** If your submission fails, check the submission logs for error messages. Common causes include invalid credentials, missing metadata, or violations of app store guidelines.
*   **Credential Issues:** If you are having trouble with credentials, double-check that you have configured them correctly and that your API keys and certificates are valid. You can revoke and recreate credentials to ensure they are working correctly.
*   **App Store Rejection:** If your app is rejected by the app store, carefully review the rejection reason and address the issues before resubmitting.
