# TransitionEvent `propertyName` Property: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

CSS transitions provide a powerful and elegant way to animate changes in CSS properties over time. When a CSS transition completes, is interrupted, or begins, a `TransitionEvent` is dispatched. The `propertyName` property of this event object is crucial for identifying which CSS property triggered the event. This article dives deep into the `TransitionEvent.propertyName` property, exploring its purpose, syntax, usage with code examples, and best practices.

## What is the `TransitionEvent.propertyName` Property?

The `TransitionEvent.propertyName` property returns a string representing the name of the CSS property that triggered the transition event. This allows you to write event listeners that can handle transitions on multiple properties, branching the logic based on which property's transition is actually occurring. Without `propertyName`, you'd have a hard time distinguishing between different property transitions within the same element.

## Syntax

The syntax for accessing the `propertyName` property is straightforward:

```javascript
let propertyName = transitionEvent.propertyName
```

Here, `transitionEvent` is an instance of the `TransitionEvent` object. The value of `propertyName` will be a string representing the CSS property that caused the event. For example, it might be `"opacity"`, `"width"`, `"transform"`, or any other CSS property that's being transitioned.

## Understanding the `TransitionEvent` Object

Before diving into examples, let's briefly recap the `TransitionEvent` object itself. This object, a subtype of `Event`, provides specific information about the CSS transition that occurred. Key properties include:

- **`propertyName`:** As discussed, the name of the CSS property that transitioned.
- **`elapsedTime`:** The amount of time the transition has been running, in seconds, when the event fired. This is useful for tracking the progress of a transition.
- **`pseudoElement`:** A string containing the name of the pseudo-element the transition originated from (e.g., `"::before"` or `"::after"`). If the transition isn't from a pseudo-element, this property is an empty string.

## Practical Examples

Let's illustrate how to use the `TransitionEvent.propertyName` property with several practical examples.

### Example 1: Basic Transition Event Handling

This example demonstrates how to listen for a transition event and log the `propertyName` to the console.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>TransitionEvent PropertyName Example</title>
<style>
  .box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
    transition: width 0.5s ease, height 0.5s ease;
  }

  .box.expanded {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="box"></div>

<button id="toggleButton">Toggle Size</button>

<script>
  const box = document.querySelector('.box');
  const toggleButton = document.getElementById('toggleButton');

  box.addEventListener('transitionend', (event) => {
    console.log(`Transition ended. Property name: ${event.propertyName}`);
  });

  toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    box.classList.toggle('expanded');
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **HTML Structure:** A `div` with the class `box` is created. A button with id `toggleButton` is also present to trigger the transition.
2.  **CSS Styling:** The `box` has initial dimensions, background color, and a `transition` property that applies to both `width` and `height`. The `.expanded` class modifies the dimensions.
3.  **JavaScript Logic:**
    - An event listener is attached to the `transitionend` event of the `box` element.
    - Inside the event listener, `event.propertyName` is logged to the console, indicating which property's transition ended.
    - The button toggles the `expanded` class on the `box`, triggering the CSS transitions.

When you click the button, you'll see messages in the console like:

```
Transition ended. Property name: width
Transition ended. Property name: height
```

or

```
Transition ended. Property name: height
Transition ended. Property name: width
```

The order may vary because the browser decides which transition finishes first.

### Example 2: Conditional Logic Based on `propertyName`

This example demonstrates how to use `propertyName` to execute different actions based on which property has completed its transition.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>TransitionEvent PropertyName Example - Conditional Logic</title>
<style>
  .box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
    opacity: 1;
    transition: width 0.5s ease, opacity 0.5s ease; /* Transition both width and opacity */
  }

  .box.expanded {
    width: 200px;
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="box"></div>

<button id="toggleButton">Toggle Size and Opacity</button>

<script>
  const box = document.querySelector('.box');
  const toggleButton = document.getElementById('toggleButton');

  box.addEventListener('transitionend', (event) => {
    if (event.propertyName === 'width') {
      console.log('Width transition ended.  Doing something specific for width.');
      // Perform width-specific actions here
    } else if (event.propertyName === 'opacity') {
      console.log('Opacity transition ended. Doing something specific for opacity.');
      // Perform opacity-specific actions here
    }
  });

  toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    box.classList.toggle('expanded');
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **CSS Changes:** The CSS now includes a transition on the `opacity` property in addition to `width`.
2.  **Conditional Logic:** Inside the `transitionend` event listener, an `if/else if` statement checks the value of `event.propertyName`. Different messages are logged depending on whether the `width` or `opacity` transition ended. You can replace the `console.log` statements with any JavaScript code you want to execute based on which property finished transitioning.

This pattern is very useful when you need to perform different actions depending on which CSS property caused the transition.

### Example 3: Working with Pseudo-Elements

This example shows how to handle transitions on pseudo-elements and use `pseudoElement` property to find transition originated from pseudo element.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>TransitionEvent PropertyName Example - Pseudo-Elements</title>
<style>
  .box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
    position: relative;
  }

  .box::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 10px;
    height: 10px;
    background-color: red;
    transition: width 0.5s ease;
  }

  .box.expanded::before {
    width: 50px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="box"></div>

<button id="toggleButton">Toggle Size</button>

<script>
  const box = document.querySelector('.box');
  const toggleButton = document.getElementById('toggleButton');

  box.addEventListener('transitionend', (event) => {
    if (event.propertyName === 'width' && event.pseudoElement === '::before') {
      console.log('Width transition on ::before pseudo-element ended!');
    }
  });

  toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    box.classList.toggle('expanded');
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **CSS Pseudo-Element:** The `box` now has a `::before` pseudo-element styled as a small red square. The `transition` property is applied to the `width` of the pseudo-element.
2.  **JavaScript Logic:** The `transitionend` event listener now includes an additional check: `event.pseudoElement === '::before'`. This ensures that the code only executes when the transition on the `::before` pseudo-element's `width` property has ended. Remember the double colon `::` is used for pseudo-elements in CSS3, but older browsers may require a single colon `:`.

### Example 4: Handling Multiple Transitions on the Same Property

When you have multiple transitions affecting the _same_ property, `propertyName` is essential for distinguishing _which_ transition triggered the event. Imagine using different easing functions or durations for different visual effects.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>TransitionEvent PropertyName Example - Multiple Transitions Same Property</title>
<style>
  .box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
    transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out, width 1s cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275); /* Bounce effect */
    /* Different transitions on the same property (width) */
  }

  .box.expanded {
    width: 200px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="box"></div>

<button id="toggleButton">Toggle Size</button>

<script>
  const box = document.querySelector('.box');
  const toggleButton = document.getElementById('toggleButton');

  box.addEventListener('transitionend', (event) => {
    if (event.propertyName === 'width') {
      console.log('Width transition ended.');
      //  Unfortunately, the propertyName alone *doesn't* tell us which transition finished.
      //  We'd need to use other techniques (like storing a transition state in data attributes,
      //  or using requestAnimationFrame to sample the width during the transition) to truly
      //  distinguish between the two transitions.
      //  This example illustrates the *challenge*, not the definitive solution.
    }
  });

  toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    box.classList.toggle('expanded');
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Multiple `width` Transitions:** The CSS `transition` property now defines _two_ transitions that affect the `width`. They have different durations and easing functions, resulting in a more complex animation.
2. **The Challenge:** While `propertyName` correctly identifies that a `width` transition ended, it _doesn't_ tell us which of the two `width` transitions actually finished. This is because the `TransitionEvent` provides information about the property, not the specific transition configuration.

**Important Note:** Distinguishing between multiple transitions on the _same_ property requires more advanced techniques. You might use:

- **`requestAnimationFrame`:** Sample the property's value during the transition to determine which transition is currently active.
- **Data Attributes:** Set data attributes on the element to track the current transition state.
- **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** Use CSS variables to control the specific transition properties dynamically.

This example highlights the limitation of `propertyName` when dealing with multiple transitions on the same property. You need additional logic to differentiate them.

## Best Practices

- **Use `propertyName` for Targeted Logic:** Always use `propertyName` to handle transitions selectively. Avoid writing generic handlers that assume a specific property transition has occurred.
- **Consider Browser Compatibility:** Ensure that the `transitionend` event and the `propertyName` property are supported in the browsers you're targeting. While widely supported, older browsers might require prefixes or alternative solutions.
- **Debounce Transition End Events (If Necessary):** In some scenarios, particularly with rapidly changing transitions, you might receive multiple `transitionend` events for the same property. Debouncing the event handler can help prevent unwanted side effects. This is generally less important now with modern browsers but can be a consideration in older systems.
- **Be Aware of Transition Interruption:** Transitions can be interrupted (e.g., by adding/removing classes rapidly). The `transitioncancel` event is also useful for handling these cases. The `propertyName` property is available on the `TransitionCancelEvent` too.
- **Use `all` with Caution:** Using `transition: all` can make `propertyName` even _more_ important, as you'll need to handle transitions on potentially many different properties. It also makes your CSS less explicit and harder to maintain, so consider specifying the properties explicitly instead.
- **Consider using Javascript Animation Libraries:** If your animation needs are complex, consider using libraries such as GreenSock (GSAP) or Anime.js, these libraries provide a fine grained animation control and their API is often much easier to use than native CSS transitions.

## Conclusion

The `TransitionEvent.propertyName` property is a fundamental tool for handling CSS transitions in JavaScript. By understanding its purpose, syntax, and usage, you can write more robust and targeted event listeners, enabling dynamic and interactive web experiences. Remember to consider the limitations when dealing with multiple transitions on the same property and leverage other techniques to achieve fine-grained control over your animations.
