# How to Extend a Partition Using CMD (Diskpart → Extend) in Windows

Running out of space on your Windows partition can be a frustrating experience. Fortunately, you don't always need third-party software to extend your partition.  Windows provides a powerful command-line tool called `Diskpart` that allows you to manage disks and partitions directly. This guide will walk you through the process of extending a partition using `Diskpart`, focusing on the `extend` command, and addressing common scenarios and potential problems.

## Understanding the Requirements and Limitations

Before we dive into the commands, it's crucial to understand the prerequisites and limitations:

*   **Unallocated Space:** To extend a partition, you need unallocated space immediately adjacent to the partition you want to expand.  This space *must* be on the right side of the target partition. Diskpart cannot move partitions to create this adjacency.
*   **NTFS Format:**  The partition you intend to extend must be formatted with the NTFS file system. Diskpart's `extend` command generally works best with NTFS.  While some older systems might technically support extending FAT32 partitions in specific situations, it's highly discouraged and can lead to data corruption.
*   **Administrator Privileges:** You must run Command Prompt as an administrator. This is essential for Diskpart to have the necessary permissions to modify your disk configuration.
*   **Backup:**  **Important:**  Always back up your important data before performing any disk management operations. While this process is generally safe, unexpected issues can arise.  A full system backup is highly recommended.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Extending a Partition with Diskpart

Here's the detailed process:

**1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**

*   Press the Windows key, type `cmd`, and right-click on "Command Prompt" in the search results.
*   Select "Run as administrator." A User Account Control (UAC) prompt will appear; click "Yes."

**2. Launch Diskpart:**

*   In the elevated Command Prompt window, type `diskpart` and press Enter. This will launch the Diskpart utility. You will see the `DISKPART>` prompt.

**3. List Disks:**

*   To identify the disk containing the partition you want to extend, type `list disk` and press Enter. This will display a list of all the disks connected to your system. Pay close attention to the disk numbers and sizes.

    ```
    DISKPART> list disk

      Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
      --------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---
      Disk 0    Online          238 GB  1024 KB        *
      Disk 1    Online          476 GB      0 B        *
    ```

**4. Select the Target Disk:**

*   Once you've identified the correct disk, select it using the `select disk` command, replacing `X` with the disk number you found in the previous step.  For example, if your target disk is Disk 0, type `select disk 0` and press Enter.

    ```
    DISKPART> select disk 0

    Disk 0 is now the selected disk.
    ```

**5. List Partitions:**

*   Now that you've selected the disk, list the partitions on that disk by typing `list partition` and pressing Enter. This will show you all the partitions on the selected disk, along with their partition numbers and sizes.

    ```
    DISKPART> list partition

      Partition ###  Type              Size     Offset
      -------------  ----------------  -------  -------
      Partition 1    System              100 MB  1024 KB
      Partition 2    Reserved           16 MB    101 MB
      Partition 3    Primary           237 GB   117 MB
      Partition 4    Recovery           500 MB  237 GB
    ```

**6. Select the Target Partition:**

*   Select the partition you want to extend using the `select partition` command, replacing `Y` with the partition number. For example, to select Partition 3, type `select partition 3` and press Enter.

    ```
    DISKPART> select partition 3

    Partition 3 is now the selected partition.
    ```

**7. Verify Available Extend Size (Optional but Recommended):**

*   Before extending, it's good practice to check the maximum amount you can extend the partition by using the `extend size=query` command. This will tell you the maximum number of megabytes the partition can be extended.  This command is available in newer versions of Diskpart. If it's not available, skip this step, but be mindful of the unallocated space.

    ```
    DISKPART> extend size=query

    The maximum number of megabytes that can be extended is: 102400
    ```

**8. Extend the Partition:**

*   Now, extend the partition using the `extend` command. You have a couple of options:

    *   **Extend to the maximum available space:** Simply type `extend` and press Enter. This will extend the selected partition to utilize all available unallocated space immediately following it.
    *   **Extend by a specific size (in MB):**  Type `extend size=Z` and press Enter, replacing `Z` with the number of megabytes you want to extend the partition by. For example, to extend by 50 GB (51200 MB), type `extend size=51200`.

    ```
    DISKPART> extend

    Diskpart successfully extended the volume.

    // OR

    DISKPART> extend size=51200

    Diskpart successfully extended the volume.
    ```

**9. Exit Diskpart:**

*   Once the partition has been successfully extended, type `exit` and press Enter to exit the Diskpart utility.  Then, type `exit` again and press Enter to close the Command Prompt window.

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

*   **"There is not enough usable free space on disk(s) to complete this operation."** This is the most common error.  It means there's no unallocated space immediately following the partition you're trying to extend.
    *   **Solution:** You'll need to either:
        *   Delete a partition that's *to the right* of your target partition (back up any data on that partition first!).
        *   Use a third-party partitioning tool that can move partitions to create contiguous unallocated space.  Moving partitions can be risky, so back up your data!
*   **"The selected volume is not a valid NTFS volume."** The partition must be formatted with the NTFS file system.
    *   **Solution:** If possible, convert the partition to NTFS using the `convert driveletter: /fs:ntfs` command.  **Warning:** Converting a FAT32 volume to NTFS *can* potentially lead to data loss in rare cases. Back up your data first!  If you're unsure, stick to extending only NTFS partitions.
*   **Diskpart hangs or freezes:** This is rare but can happen.
    *   **Solution:** Try restarting your computer and running Diskpart again. If it still freezes, there might be a more serious disk issue. Run a disk check (chkdsk) from the Command Prompt (as administrator) before attempting Diskpart again.

## Alternatives to Diskpart

While Diskpart is a powerful tool, it can be intimidating for some users.  Consider these alternatives:

*   **Disk Management (GUI):** Windows has a built-in graphical disk management tool.  You can access it by searching for "Disk Management" in the Start menu.  Right-click on a partition and select "Extend Volume..." to launch the wizard. While it's easier to use, it has the same limitations as Diskpart regarding contiguous unallocated space.
*   **Third-party Partitioning Software:**  Tools like EaseUS Partition Master, AOMEI Partition Assistant, and MiniTool Partition Wizard offer more advanced features, such as moving partitions and merging unallocated space from non-adjacent locations. These tools often have a more user-friendly interface.

## Conclusion

Extending a partition using Diskpart can be a quick and efficient way to increase disk space without relying on third-party software. However, it's essential to understand the prerequisites and limitations, particularly the need for contiguous unallocated space. Always back up your data before making any changes to your disk configuration.  By following this guide, you should be able to successfully extend your partition and optimize your disk space. Remember to exercise caution and double-check your commands before execution to avoid accidental data loss.
