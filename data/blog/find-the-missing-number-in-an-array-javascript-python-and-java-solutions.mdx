# Find the Missing Number in an Array: JavaScript, Python, & Java Solutions

This blog post explores different techniques to solve a common algorithmic problem: finding the missing number in an array of consecutive numbers. This problem is frequently encountered in coding interviews and is a great way to demonstrate your understanding of arrays, algorithms, and time complexity. We'll provide solutions in JavaScript, Python, and Java, along with explanations and performance considerations.

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n-1` integers. These integers are within the range of 1 to `n`. There are no duplicates in the array. One number is missing from the sequence. Your task is to find the missing number.

**Example:**

Given the array `[1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]`, where `n = 8`, the missing number is `5`.

## Approaches to Finding the Missing Number

Several approaches can be used to solve this problem. We'll cover the following methods:

1.  **Summation Method:** Utilizing the sum of consecutive numbers formula.
2.  **XOR Method:** Using the XOR operator to cancel out matching numbers.
3.  **HashSet Method (Java Specific):** Storing the array elements in a HashSet.
4.  **Sorting Method:** Sorting the array and iterating through it.

Let's dive into each method with code examples and explanations.

## 1. Summation Method

This method leverages the formula for the sum of consecutive numbers: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. We calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to `n` and then subtract the actual sum of the numbers in the array. The difference will be the missing number.

**JavaScript Example:**

```plaintext
function findMissingNumberSummation(arr, n) {
  const expectedSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
  let actualSum = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    actualSum += arr[i]
  }

  return expectedSum - actualSum
}

// Example Usage
const arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
const n = 8
const missingNumber = findMissingNumberSummation(arr, n)
console.log('Missing number (Summation):', missingNumber) // Output: 5
```

**Python Example:**

```plaintext
def find_missing_number_summation(arr, n):
  expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
  actual_sum = sum(arr)
  return expected_sum - actual_sum

# Example Usage
arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
n = 8
missing_number = find_missing_number_summation(arr, n)
print("Missing number (Summation):", missing_number) # Output: 5
```

**Java Example:**

```plaintext
public class FindMissingNumber {

    public static int findMissingNumberSummation(int[] arr, int n) {
        long expectedSum = (long) n * (n + 1) / 2;
        long actualSum = 0;

        for (int num : arr) {
            actualSum += num;
        }

        return (int) (expectedSum - actualSum);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8};
        int n = 8;
        int missingNumber = findMissingNumberSummation(arr, n);
        System.out.println("Missing number (Summation): " + missingNumber); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space.

## 2. XOR Method

The XOR method utilizes the property that `x ^ x = 0` and `x ^ 0 = x`. We XOR all numbers from 1 to `n` and then XOR the result with all the numbers in the array. The remaining value after these XOR operations will be the missing number.

**JavaScript Example:**

```plaintext
function findMissingNumberXOR(arr, n) {
  let xor1 = 0
  let xor2 = 0

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    xor1 = xor1 ^ i
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    xor2 = xor2 ^ arr[i]
  }

  return xor1 ^ xor2
}

// Example Usage
const arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
const n = 8
const missingNumber = findMissingNumberXOR(arr, n)
console.log('Missing number (XOR):', missingNumber) // Output: 5
```

**Python Example:**

```plaintext
def find_missing_number_xor(arr, n):
  xor1 = 0
  xor2 = 0

  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    xor1 ^= i

  for num in arr:
    xor2 ^= num

  return xor1 ^ xor2

# Example Usage
arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
n = 8
missing_number = find_missing_number_xor(arr, n)
print("Missing number (XOR):", missing_number) # Output: 5
```

**Java Example:**

```plaintext
public class FindMissingNumber {

    public static int findMissingNumberXOR(int[] arr, int n) {
        int xor1 = 0;
        int xor2 = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            xor1 = xor1 ^ i;
        }

        for (int num : arr) {
            xor2 = xor2 ^ num;
        }

        return xor1 ^ xor2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8};
        int n = 8;
        int missingNumber = findMissingNumberXOR(arr, n);
        System.out.println("Missing number (XOR): " + missingNumber); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate from 1 to `n` and then through the array once.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space. This method is often preferred for its efficiency and conciseness.

## 3. HashSet Method (Java Specific)

This method, primarily applicable to Java due to the readily available `HashSet` data structure, involves storing all the elements of the array in a HashSet. Then, we iterate from 1 to `n` and check if each number is present in the HashSet. The first number not found in the HashSet is the missing number.

**Java Example:**

```plaintext
import java.util.HashSet;

public class FindMissingNumber {

    public static int findMissingNumberHashSet(int[] arr, int n) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            set.add(num);
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (!set.contains(i)) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1; // Should not reach here if there is indeed a missing number
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8};
        int n = 8;
        int missingNumber = findMissingNumberHashSet(arr, n);
        System.out.println("Missing number (HashSet): " + missingNumber); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array once to add elements to the HashSet and then iterate from 1 to `n` to check for the missing number. HashSet `contains` operation has an average time complexity of O(1).
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - We store the elements of the array in the HashSet, which takes O(n) space.

## 4. Sorting Method

This method involves sorting the array first. After sorting, we can iterate through the array and check if each element is equal to its expected value (starting from 1). If we find an element that doesn't match its expected value, the expected value is the missing number.

**JavaScript Example:**

```plaintext
function findMissingNumberSorting(arr, n) {
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b) // Sort the array in ascending order

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] !== i + 1) {
      return i + 1
    }
  }

  return n // If all numbers from 1 to n-1 are present, then n is the missing number
}

// Example Usage
const arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
const n = 8
const missingNumber = findMissingNumberSorting(arr, n)
console.log('Missing number (Sorting):', missingNumber) // Output: 5
```

**Python Example:**

```plaintext
def find_missing_number_sorting(arr, n):
  arr.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order

  for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] != i + 1:
      return i + 1

  return n  # If all numbers from 1 to n-1 are present, then n is the missing number


# Example Usage
arr = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
n = 8
missing_number = find_missing_number_sorting(arr, n)
print("Missing number (Sorting):", missing_number)  # Output: 5
```

**Java Example:**

```plaintext
import java.util.Arrays;

public class FindMissingNumber {

    public static int findMissingNumberSorting(int[] arr, int n) {
        Arrays.sort(arr); // Sort the array in ascending order

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != i + 1) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }

        return n; // If all numbers from 1 to n-1 are present, then n is the missing number
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8};
        int n = 8;
        int missingNumber = findMissingNumberSorting(arr, n);
        System.out.println("Missing number (Sorting): " + missingNumber); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - The dominant operation is sorting the array, which typically has a time complexity of O(n log n).
**Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(n) depending on the sorting algorithm. Some sorting algorithms (like heapsort) can be done in-place with O(1) space, while others (like mergesort) require O(n) space.

## Choosing the Right Approach

The best approach for finding the missing number depends on the specific constraints of the problem:

- **Summation Method:** Simple and efficient when overflow is not a concern. Be careful with large values of `n` as the sum `n*(n+1)/2` could exceed the maximum integer value. In Java you can use `long` to help avoid overflow.
- **XOR Method:** Generally the most efficient and concise solution. Less prone to overflow issues compared to the summation method.
- **HashSet Method (Java):** Useful when you need to quickly check if a number is present or not, but it requires extra space.
- **Sorting Method:** The least efficient method in terms of time complexity. Avoid if performance is critical.

In most cases, the **XOR method** is the preferred approach due to its efficiency, conciseness, and minimal space requirements. However, understand the trade-offs of each method to choose the best one for your specific scenario.

## Conclusion
