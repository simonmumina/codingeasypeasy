# JavaScript `Promise.any()`: Handle Multiple Promises and Get the First Resolved Value

In modern JavaScript development, asynchronous operations are ubiquitous.  We often need to make multiple API calls, read from several files, or perform other parallel tasks.  JavaScript's `Promise` object provides a powerful mechanism for handling asynchronous operations.  One particularly useful method introduced in ES2021 is `Promise.any()`. This blog post will explore `Promise.any()` in detail, explaining its functionality, use cases, and how it differs from other Promise methods.

## What is `Promise.any()`?

`Promise.any()` takes an iterable (like an array) of `Promise` objects as its argument.  It returns a single `Promise` that resolves with the value of the *first* promise in the iterable that resolves successfully (i.e., fulfills). If all promises reject, `Promise.any()` rejects with an `AggregateError` containing all of the rejection reasons.

Essentially, `Promise.any()` is the opposite of `Promise.all()`. Where `Promise.all()` waits for all promises to resolve, `Promise.any()` only needs one promise to succeed.

## Syntax

```javascript
Promise.any(iterable);
```

*   `iterable`:  An iterable object, such as an `Array`, containing `Promise` objects.

## Basic Examples

Let's start with a simple example to illustrate the fundamental behavior of `Promise.any()`:

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject("Promise 1 Rejected"), 1000);
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise 2 Resolved"), 500);
});

const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise 3 Resolved"), 1500);
});

Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((value) => {
    console.log("Resolved:", value); // Output: Resolved: Promise 2 Resolved
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Rejected:", error);
  });
```

In this example:

*   `promise1` rejects after 1 second.
*   `promise2` resolves with "Promise 2 Resolved" after 0.5 seconds.
*   `promise3` resolves with "Promise 3 Resolved" after 1.5 seconds.

Since `promise2` resolves the fastest, `Promise.any()` resolves with its value.

## Handling Rejections

Now, let's see what happens when all promises reject:

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject("Promise 1 Rejected"), 500);
});

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject("Promise 2 Rejected"), 1000);
});

const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject("Promise 3 Rejected"), 1500);
});

Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
  .then((value) => {
    console.log("Resolved:", value);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Rejected:", error);
    console.error("AggregateError Messages:", error.errors);
  });
```

Output:

```
Rejected: AggregateError: All promises were rejected
AggregateError Messages: [ 'Promise 1 Rejected', 'Promise 2 Rejected', 'Promise 3 Rejected' ]
```

As you can see, `Promise.any()` rejects with an `AggregateError` if all promises are rejected. The `error.errors` property contains an array of the rejection reasons from each promise.

## Use Cases

`Promise.any()` is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to:

*   **Fetch data from multiple sources:** Imagine you're fetching data from multiple APIs, and you only need the data from the first one that responds successfully. `Promise.any()` is perfect for this.

    ```javascript
    const fetchFromAPI1 = () =>
      fetch("https://api1.example.com/data").then((response) => response.json());

    const fetchFromAPI2 = () =>
      fetch("https://api2.example.com/data").then((response) => response.json());

    Promise.any([fetchFromAPI1(), fetchFromAPI2()])
      .then((data) => {
        console.log("Data fetched:", data);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Failed to fetch data from all APIs:", error);
      });
    ```

*   **Implement fallback mechanisms:** If a primary service is unavailable, you can use `Promise.any()` to try alternative services.

    ```javascript
    const primaryService = () =>
      new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => reject("Primary service unavailable"), 500);
      });

    const fallbackService = () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Using fallback service"), 100);
      });

    Promise.any([primaryService(), fallbackService()])
      .then((result) => {
        console.log(result); // Output: Using fallback service
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Both services failed:", error);
      });
    ```

*   **Race conditions:** You can use `Promise.any()` when you want to handle the result of the fastest promise, regardless of whether the others succeed or fail later.

## `Promise.any()` vs. Other Promise Methods

It's essential to understand the differences between `Promise.any()` and other Promise methods to choose the right tool for the job.

*   **`Promise.all()`:** Waits for all promises in the iterable to resolve *or* rejects immediately if any of the promises reject.  It resolves with an array of the resolved values.  Use `Promise.all()` when you need all the promises to succeed.

*   **`Promise.allSettled()`:** Waits for all promises in the iterable to either resolve *or* reject. It resolves with an array of objects, each describing the outcome of a promise (either resolved or rejected). Use `Promise.allSettled()` when you want to know the outcome of all promises, regardless of their success or failure.

*   **`Promise.race()`:** Resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects. It resolves or rejects with the value or reason of that first settled promise.  Use `Promise.race()` when you only care about the first promise to settle, regardless of whether it resolves or rejects.

*   **`Promise.any()`:** Resolves as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves successfully.  It rejects only when all promises reject, using an `AggregateError`. Use `Promise.any()` when you want the value of the *first successful* promise and can tolerate rejections.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Method             | Behavior                                                                         | Resolves with                               | Rejects when                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise.all()`      | Waits for all to resolve, rejects if any rejects                               | Array of resolved values                    | Any promise rejects                                 |
| `Promise.allSettled()` | Waits for all to settle (resolve or reject)                                    | Array of outcome objects (resolved/rejected) | Never                                               |
| `Promise.race()`     | Settles with the first promise to settle (resolve or reject)                    | Value or reason of the first settled promise | Value or reason of the first settled promise         |
| `Promise.any()`      | Resolves with the first promise to resolve, rejects only if all reject          | Value of the first resolved promise         | All promises reject (with `AggregateError`)        |

## Browser Compatibility

`Promise.any()` is a relatively recent addition to JavaScript (ES2021).  While it is widely supported in modern browsers, you might need to use a polyfill for older browsers or environments. You can use polyfills available on npm, like `core-js`, to provide support for older environments.

## Example with `async/await`

You can also use `Promise.any()` with `async/await` for more readable code:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const data = await Promise.any([
      fetch("https://api1.example.com/data").then((response) => response.json()),
      fetch("https://api2.example.com/data").then((response) => response.json()),
    ]);
    console.log("Data fetched:", data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch data:", error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

## Conclusion

`Promise.any()` is a valuable tool for handling multiple promises when you only need the first successful result. It simplifies scenarios like fetching data from multiple sources or implementing fallback mechanisms. Understanding its behavior and differences from other Promise methods will help you write more efficient and robust asynchronous JavaScript code. Remember to consider browser compatibility and use polyfills if necessary. By mastering `Promise.any()`, you can take your asynchronous JavaScript programming skills to the next level.
