# Automate Android Expo Builds with Google Cloud Build: A Step-by-Step Guide

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are crucial for modern mobile application development.  Automating your build process not only saves time but also reduces the risk of human error and ensures consistency across deployments. This guide walks you through setting up Google Cloud Build to automatically build your Android Expo applications.

## Why Use Google Cloud Build for Expo Android Builds?

Google Cloud Build offers several advantages for automating your Expo Android builds:

*   **Scalability:** Cloud Build leverages Google's infrastructure, providing scalability to handle builds of any size.
*   **Customization:**  You can define your build steps using Dockerfiles and build configuration files, allowing for a highly customized build process.
*   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Google Cloud services and third-party tools, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:**  Cloud Build offers a free tier and pay-as-you-go pricing, making it a cost-effective solution for most projects.
*   **Security:** Google Cloud provides a secure environment for building your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **A Google Cloud Account:** If you don't have one, sign up for a free trial at [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).
*   **An Expo Project:** A React Native project created with Expo. Make sure you can build it locally.
*   **Firebase Project (Optional):** If your Expo app uses Firebase services, you'll need a Firebase project.
*   **A Version Control System (VCS):**  GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. Your Expo project should be hosted in a repository.
*   **Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI):**  Installed and configured on your local machine. Download and install it from the [Google Cloud SDK documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## Step 1: Enable the Cloud Build API

1.  **Log in to the Google Cloud Console:** Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  **Select or Create a Project:** Choose the Google Cloud project you want to use for Cloud Build.
3.  **Enable the Cloud Build API:** Navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "APIs & Services" and search for "Cloud Build API". Click "Enable".

## Step 2: Create a Service Account

Cloud Build uses a service account to access your resources. You'll need to create one and grant it the necessary permissions.

1.  **Navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".**
2.  **Click "Create Service Account".**
3.  **Enter a Service Account Name** (e.g., `cloud-build-expo`).
4.  **Enter a Service Account Description** (e.g., "Service account for Cloud Build Expo").
5.  **Click "Create and Continue".**
6.  **Grant the Service Account the following roles:**
    *   `Cloud Build Service Account`
    *   `Storage Object Admin`
    *   `Firebase Admin` (If your app uses Firebase)
7.  **Click "Continue" and then "Done".**
8.  **Note the Service Account Email:**  You'll need this later.  It's in the format `cloud-build-expo@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

## Step 3: Create a `cloudbuild.yaml` File

This file defines the build steps for Cloud Build.  Create a file named `cloudbuild.yaml` in the root directory of your Expo project. Here's an example:

```yaml
steps:
  # Step 1: Install Node.js dependencies
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install']
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

  # Step 2: Configure Expo
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install', '-g', 'expo-cli']
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

  # Step 3: Install EAS CLI
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install', '-g', 'eas-cli']
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

  # Step 4: EAS Build
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: eas
    args: ['build', '-p', 'android', '--non-interactive', '--platform', 'android', '--profile', 'production']
    env:
      - EAS_USERNAME=$EAS_USERNAME
      - EAS_PASSWORD=$EAS_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

images:
  - gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/expo-android-build
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`steps`:** Defines the build steps.  Each step is executed sequentially.
*   **`name`:**  Specifies the Docker image to use for the step.  We're using the `node:16` image, which includes Node.js and npm.
*   **`entrypoint`:** The command to execute.
*   **`args`:**  Arguments to pass to the command.
*   **`volumes`:**  This is important for caching `node_modules` between build steps.  It significantly speeds up the build process.
*   **`env`:**  Environment variables to set for the step. `EAS_USERNAME` and `EAS_PASSWORD` should be set as Cloud Build secrets (explained in the next section). Make sure you are using the service account that you have created.
*   **`images`:**  The name of the Docker image to build.  In this example, we're not building a custom image, so this is just a placeholder.  You can remove it if you don't need to push any images.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **EAS Configuration:**  This `cloudbuild.yaml` assumes you're using EAS Build. You'll need to have a configured `eas.json` file in your Expo project.
*   **Build Profile:** The `--profile` flag in the `eas build` command specifies the build profile defined in your `eas.json` file (e.g., `production`, `development`).  Ensure this profile is correctly configured for Android builds.
*   **Alternative approach using expo-cli** While EAS build is the recommended way to build Expo apps, you could use the old expo-cli. Note that expo-cli is deprecated. If you want to use it, you will have to create a service account with the necessary permissions (see the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/)).

## Step 4: Configure Secrets

Protecting your credentials is crucial.  We'll store the `EAS_USERNAME` and `EAS_PASSWORD` as secrets in Cloud Build.

1.  **Navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Secret Manager".**
2.  **Click "Create Secret".**
3.  **Enter a Secret Name** (e.g., `eas-username`).
4.  **Enter the Secret Value** (your Expo username).
5.  **Click "Create Secret".**
6.  **Repeat steps 2-5 for `eas-password`**, entering your Expo password.
7.  **Grant Access to Secrets:** For each secret, grant the Cloud Build service account (`cloud-build-expo@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) the "Secret Manager Secret Accessor" role.  Click the secret, go to the "Permissions" tab, click "Grant Access", add the service account email, and select the role.

## Step 5: Configure Triggers (Automated Builds)

To automatically trigger builds on code changes, you'll create a Cloud Build trigger.

1.  **Navigate to "CI/CD" > "Cloud Build" > "Triggers".**
2.  **Click "Create Trigger".**
3.  **Enter a Trigger Name** (e.g., `expo-android-build-trigger`).
4.  **Select the Source:** Choose your repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab). You may need to connect your repository provider if you haven't already.
5.  **Configure the Trigger:**
    *   **Event:** Choose the event that triggers the build (e.g., "Push to a branch").
    *   **Branch:** Specify the branch to trigger the build (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
    *   **Configuration:** Choose "Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json)".
    *   **Cloud Build configuration file location:** `/cloudbuild.yaml` (or the path to your `cloudbuild.yaml` file).
6.  **Define Substitutions:** This is how we pass the secret values to the build. Add the following substitutions:

    ```
    _EAS_USERNAME: $(secret("eas-username"))
    _EAS_PASSWORD: $(secret("eas-password"))
    ```

7.  **Click "Create".**

## Step 6: Test Your Cloud Build

1.  **Trigger a Build:**  Either manually trigger the trigger in the Cloud Build console, or push a change to the branch you configured.
2.  **Monitor the Build:** Go to "CI/CD" > "Cloud Build" > "History" to monitor the build progress.
3.  **Troubleshooting:** If the build fails, review the logs to identify the issue. Common problems include:
    *   Incorrect credentials.
    *   Missing dependencies.
    *   Incorrect `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration.
    *   Insufficient permissions for the service account.
    *   Problems with the `eas.json` configuration.

## Step 7: Accessing the Build Artifact (APK)

After the build completes successfully, the Android APK file will be uploaded to EAS Build.  You can access it through the EAS Build dashboard. Alternatively you can configure your `eas.json` to automatically upload to google play store after build, or you can add another step to your cloudbuild.yaml file to upload it to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage or any other service.

## Example of cloudbuild.yaml adding a step to copy APK to Google Cloud Storage

First you need to update the `eas build` command in the original `cloudbuild.yaml` to output the built APK file to a known location.  EAS Build typically manages the APK output automatically. If you are using EAS CLI, you don't have direct control over the APK file and are better off downloading from EAS CLI dashboard. If you are using `expo build:android`, you could specify output path. However, `expo build:android` is deprecated, so is not recommended to use it.

If you want to download from EAS CLI:

```yaml
steps:
  # Step 1: Install Node.js dependencies
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install']
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

  # Step 2: Configure Expo
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install', '-g', 'expo-cli']
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

  # Step 3: Install EAS CLI
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: npm
    args: ['install', '-g', 'eas-cli']
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

  # Step 4: EAS Build
  - name: node:16
    entrypoint: bash # Use bash to chain commands
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |
        eas build -p android --non-interactive --platform android --profile production
        # After the build, get the build ID from the EAS CLI output
        BUILD_ID=$(eas build:list --json | jq -r '.[0].id')

        # Download the APK to a specific location
        eas build:download -i $BUILD_ID -o app.apk --platform android
    env:
      - EAS_USERNAME=$EAS_USERNAME
      - EAS_PASSWORD=$EAS_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

  # Step 5: Upload APK to Google Cloud Storage
  - name: google/cloud-sdk:slim # Use the cloud-sdk image
    entrypoint: gsutil
    args: ['cp', 'app.apk', 'gs://your-bucket-name/app.apk'] # Replace with your bucket name
    volumes:
      - name: 'node_modules'
        path: '/node_modules'

images:
  - gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/expo-android-build
```

Replace `gs://your-bucket-name/app.apk` with the actual path to your desired Google Cloud Storage bucket and filename.

**Remember to grant your service account the `Storage Object Creator` role on your Google Cloud Storage bucket.**
