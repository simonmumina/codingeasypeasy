# How to Monitor Gatsby Deployments: Performance, Errors, and Uptime

Deploying a Gatsby website is only the first step. Ensuring it remains performant, reliable, and free of errors requires robust monitoring strategies. This comprehensive guide explores various techniques and tools to monitor your Gatsby deployments, covering everything from key performance indicators (KPIs) to error tracking and uptime monitoring. By implementing these strategies, you can proactively identify and address issues, optimizing your Gatsby website for a seamless user experience.

## Why Monitoring Gatsby Deployments is Crucial

Monitoring your Gatsby website offers several significant advantages:

- **Early Issue Detection:** Identify errors, performance bottlenecks, and downtime before they impact users.
- **Improved User Experience:** Faster loading times and fewer errors translate to happier visitors.
- **Data-Driven Optimization:** Real-time data provides insights for continuous website improvement.
- **Reduced Downtime:** Quickly address and resolve issues, minimizing the impact on your website's availability.
- **Cost Optimization:** Identify inefficiencies and optimize resource usage, leading to potential cost savings.
- **Faster Problem Resolution:** Monitor errors and metrics from your Gatsby site.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

Understanding which metrics to track is the foundation of effective monitoring. Here are some essential KPIs for Gatsby deployments:

- **Page Load Time (PLT):** Measures how long it takes for a page to fully load. A key indicator of user experience. Aim for a PLT of under 3 seconds, ideally under 1 second.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Measures the time when the first text or image is painted on the screen. This is a crucial metric for perceived performance.
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** Indicates when the page becomes fully interactive, meaning users can interact with elements without delay.
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** Measures the total amount of time that the main thread is blocked by long tasks, preventing users from interacting with the page.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Quantifies unexpected layout shifts that occur during page loading, contributing to a frustrating user experience. Aim for a CLS score close to 0.
- **Error Rate:** The percentage of requests that result in errors (e.g., 500 errors, 404 errors). A high error rate indicates underlying issues requiring investigation.
- **Uptime:** The percentage of time your website is accessible to users. Aim for 99.99% uptime ("four nines").
- **Server Response Time:** The time it takes for the server to respond to a request. Long response times can indicate server overload or inefficient code.
- **CPU Usage:** Tracks the CPU usage on your server. High CPU usage can indicate performance bottlenecks or resource constraints.
- **Memory Usage:** Monitors the memory usage on your server. Excessive memory usage can lead to performance degradation or crashes.
- **Network Traffic:** Measures the amount of data transferred to and from your server. High network traffic can indicate a surge in user activity or potential security issues.
