# BootstrapVue vs. Vue-Bootstrap-Next: Choosing the Right Bootstrap Component Library for Your Vue.js Project

When building a Vue.js application with a Bootstrap-inspired design, you have several excellent component libraries to choose from. Two prominent contenders are **BootstrapVue** and **Vue-Bootstrap-Next**. Both provide a wide range of pre-built components based on Bootstrap, but they have key differences that can influence your decision. This article provides a detailed comparison to help you choose the best library for your specific needs.

## What are BootstrapVue and Vue-Bootstrap-Next?

- **BootstrapVue:** A well-established Vue.js integration of Bootstrap. It offers a comprehensive suite of components, directives, and plugins designed to seamlessly integrate Bootstrap's styling and functionality within Vue.js applications. It's based on Bootstrap v4.

- **Vue-Bootstrap-Next:** A modern fork of the original Vue-Bootstrap, built for Bootstrap v5 and leveraging Vue 3. It aims to provide a more modern and performant experience while maintaining a familiar API for those migrating from Vue-Bootstrap or BootstrapVue. It includes updated components, improved accessibility features, and support for the latest Bootstrap functionalities.

## Key Differences: Bootstrap Version & Vue Version

The most fundamental difference lies in the underlying Bootstrap and Vue.js versions each library supports:

- **BootstrapVue:** Uses **Bootstrap v4** and is compatible with **Vue 2**.
- **Vue-Bootstrap-Next:** Uses **Bootstrap v5** and requires **Vue 3**.

This is a crucial factor. If you're starting a new project with Vue 3 and want the latest Bootstrap features, Vue-Bootstrap-Next is the clear choice. If you're working on an older Vue 2 project, or need compatibility with Bootstrap 4, BootstrapVue is the better option.

## Feature Comparison

Let's delve into the features each library offers:

| Feature           | BootstrapVue (Bootstrap v4, Vue 2) | Vue-Bootstrap-Next (Bootstrap v5, Vue 3) | Notes                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Installation and Setup

Let's walk through the installation process for each library.

**BootstrapVue (Vue 2):**

First, install the packages using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install bootstrap-vue bootstrap
# OR
yarn add bootstrap-vue bootstrap
```

Then, register BootstrapVue in your `main.js` file:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import BootstrapVue from 'bootstrap-vue'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
import 'bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css'
import App from './App.vue'

Vue.use(BootstrapVue)

new Vue({
  render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount('#app')
```

**Vue-Bootstrap-Next (Vue 3):**

Install the packages using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install vue-bootstrap-next bootstrap
# OR
yarn add vue-bootstrap-next bootstrap
```

Then, register Vue-Bootstrap-Next in your `main.js` (or `main.ts`) file:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import BootstrapVueNext from 'vue-bootstrap-next'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(BootstrapVueNext)

app.mount('#app')
```

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of using a button component in both libraries:

**BootstrapVue (Vue 2):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <b-button variant="primary">Click Me</b-button>
  </div>
</template>
```

**Vue-Bootstrap-Next (Vue 3):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <BButton variant="primary">Click Me</BButton>
  </div>
</template>
```

The component names might differ slightly (e.g., `b-button` vs. `BButton`), but the overall structure and prop usage are generally consistent. The key difference is the Vue version and Bootstrap version powering them.

Here's a more complex example showing a basic table with data:

**BootstrapVue (Vue 2):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <b-table striped hover :items="items" :fields="fields"></b-table>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      fields: ['firstName', 'lastName', 'age'],
      items: [
        { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30 },
        { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe', age: 25 },
        { firstName: 'Peter', lastName: 'Pan', age: 100 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

**Vue-Bootstrap-Next (Vue 3):**

```plaintext
<template>
  <div>
    <BTable striped hover :items="items" :fields="fields"></BTable>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const fields = ref(['firstName', 'lastName', 'age']);
const items = ref([
  { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30 },
  { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe', age: 25 },
  { firstName: 'Peter', lastName: 'Pan', age: 100 }
]);
</script>
```

Notice the main difference is the script setup and the use of `ref` to manage reactive data in Vue 3. The table component usage remains very similar.

## Considerations When Choosing

Here's a summary of the key factors to consider:

- **Vue.js Version:**

  - **Vue 2:** Choose BootstrapVue.
  - **Vue 3:** Choose Vue-Bootstrap-Next.
