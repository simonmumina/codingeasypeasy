# Build a Powerful NestJS CLI Tool: Extend @nestjs/cli for Custom Commands

The NestJS CLI (`@nestjs/cli`) is a fantastic tool for bootstrapping and managing NestJS applications. But what if you want to add custom commands to automate specific tasks within your projects? This post will guide you through the process of extending the NestJS CLI, allowing you to create your own bespoke commands for enhanced developer productivity.

## Why Extend the NestJS CLI?

Extending the CLI provides several benefits:

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks like generating boilerplate code, creating modules, or interacting with external services.
- **Consistency:** Enforce project standards and best practices by standardizing common operations through CLI commands.
- **Productivity:** Save time and reduce errors by providing developers with easy-to-use command-line interfaces for complex tasks.
- **Customization:** Tailor the CLI to your specific project requirements and workflow.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js (>= 16.0.0):** Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.
- **NestJS CLI:** You should have the NestJS CLI installed globally: `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`
- **Basic NestJS knowledge:** Familiarity with NestJS concepts like modules, providers, and services is helpful.

## Step 1: Setting up a NestJS Project

If you don't already have a NestJS project, create one:

```plaintext
nest new my-custom-cli-project
cd my-custom-cli-project
```

## Step 2: Installing Dependencies

We need to install the necessary dependencies to extend the CLI:

```plaintext
npm install inquirer commander chalk @nestjs/schematics @nestjs/core --save-dev
```

- `inquirer`: For prompting the user for input.
- `commander`: For parsing command-line arguments.
- `chalk`: For adding color and formatting to the console output.
- `@nestjs/schematics`: Provides utilities for generating code and modifying files within your project. This is _crucial_ for actually automating file changes.
- `@nestjs/core`: The core NestJS library, needed for metadata and other utilities.

## Step 3: Creating the Custom Command Module

Let's create a module to house our custom command. Create a directory named `cli` and a file named `cli.module.ts` inside it:

```plaintext
mkdir src/cli
touch src/cli/cli.module.ts
```

Open `src/cli/cli.module.ts` and add the following code:

```plaintext
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { MyCustomCommand } from './commands/my-custom.command'

@Module({
  providers: [MyCustomCommand],
})
export class CliModule {}
```

This module declares `MyCustomCommand` (which we'll create in the next step) as a provider. This makes it available within our NestJS application context.

## Step 4: Creating the Custom Command

Now, let's create the actual custom command. Create a directory named `commands` inside the `cli` directory, and a file named `my-custom.command.ts` inside it:

```plaintext
mkdir src/cli/commands
touch src/cli/commands/my-custom.command.ts
```

Open `src/cli/commands/my-custom.command.ts` and add the following code:

```plaintext
import { Command, CommandRunner, InquirerService } from 'nest-commander'
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import * as chalk from 'chalk'

interface BasicCommandOptions {
  name?: string
}

@Injectable()
@Command({
  name: 'my-custom-command',
  description: 'A custom command to demonstrate extending the NestJS CLI.',
  aliases: ['mcc'], // Optional: Add aliases for your command
})
export class MyCustomCommand extends CommandRunner {
  constructor(private readonly inquirer: InquirerService) {
    super()
  }

  async run(passedParams: string[], options?: BasicCommandOptions): Promise<void> {
    let name = options?.name

    if (!name) {
      const answers = await this.inquirer.ask<{ name: string }>('basic-questions', undefined)
      name = answers.name
    }

    console.log(chalk.green(`Hello, ${name}! This is a custom NestJS CLI command.`))
    console.log(chalk.blue('Executing additional logic...'))

    // Add your custom logic here
    // For example, you could interact with a service, generate files, etc.

    console.log(chalk.yellow('Command execution complete.'))
  }

  async askForMissingParameters(): Promise<BasicCommandOptions> {
    const answers = await this.inquirer.ask<{ name: string }>('basic-questions', undefined)
    return answers
  }

  @Command({ name: 'another-subcommand', description: 'A subcommand example' })
  async anotherSubcommand(passedParams: string[], options?: BasicCommandOptions): Promise<void> {
    console.log(chalk.red('Executing another subcommand!'))
  }
}
```

Let's break down this code:

- **`@Injectable()`:** Marks the class as injectable, allowing NestJS to manage its dependencies.
- **`@Command()`:** Decorator that defines the command's name, description, and optional aliases. The `name` property is what you'll use to invoke the command from the command line (e.g., `nest my-custom-command`).
- **`CommandRunner`:** Extends `CommandRunner` which provides the `run` method to execute the command logic.
- **`constructor(private readonly inquirer: InquirerService)`:** Injects the `InquirerService` which handles user prompts.
- **`run(passedParams: string[], options?: BasicCommandOptions): Promise<void>`:** This method contains the command's logic.
  - `passedParams`: An array of arguments passed directly after the command name (e.g., `nest my-custom-command arg1 arg2`).
  - `options`: An object containing options (flags) passed to the command (e.g., `nest my-custom-command --name=John`).
  - The code first checks if the `name` option was provided. If not, it uses `inquirer` to prompt the user for their name.
  - Finally, it logs a greeting message using `chalk` for colored output. You would replace the placeholder comments with your actual command logic.
- **`askForMissingParameters(): Promise<BasicCommandOptions>`:** Defines a method to be used to prompt the user to answer questions when the necessary parameters are missing or haven't been provided. Here we are prompting the user for their name if they have not specified using the parameters.
- **`@Command({ name: 'another-subcommand', description: 'A subcommand example' })`:** Defines a sub command. You can nest these as required.

## Step 5: Configuring Inquirer Prompts

To enable user prompts with Inquirer, create a new file named `cli.prompts.ts` under `src/cli`:

```plaintext
touch src/cli/cli.prompts.ts
```

Open `src/cli/cli.prompts.ts` and add the following code:

```plaintext
import { QuestionSet } from 'nest-commander'

@QuestionSet({ name: 'basic-questions' })
export class BasicQuestions {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type
  getQuestions() {
    return [
      {
        type: 'input',
        name: 'name',
        message: 'Please enter your name:',
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

This defines a question set named `basic-questions` that contains a single question: asking the user for their name.

## Step 6: Importing Modules and Registering the Command in AppModule

Now we need to import the `CliModule` and `BasicQuestions` into our main `AppModule` and register the command so NestJS knows about it.

Open `src/app.module.ts` and modify it as follows:

```plaintext
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'
import { CliModule } from './cli/cli.module'
import { BasicQuestions } from './cli/cli.prompts'

@Module({
  imports: [CliModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService, BasicQuestions],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

We've imported `CliModule` and added it to the `imports` array. We've also added `BasicQuestions` to the providers array so the CLI can utilise the questions.

## Step 7: Updating `main.ts`

Finally, update `src/main.ts` to bootstrap the NestJS CLI. This is the most crucial step! We need to tell NestJS to use the `CommandFactory` to create an application specifically for the CLI.

```plaintext
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'
import { CommandFactory } from 'nest-commander'

async function bootstrap() {
  await CommandFactory.run(AppModule, ['warn', 'error']) // Configure logger level
}
bootstrap()
```

The `CommandFactory.run` method initializes the CLI application using your `AppModule` and allows you to configure the logger level.

## Step 8: Running the Custom Command

Now you can run your custom command!

```plaintext
nest my-custom-command --name="Your Name"
```

Or, without the name option:

```plaintext
nest my-custom-command
```

You will be prompted to enter your name.

You should see output similar to:

```
Hello, Your Name! This is a custom NestJS CLI command.
Executing additional logic...
Command execution complete.
```

To run the subcommand:

```plaintext
nest my-custom-command another-subcommand
```

Which will output:

```
Executing another subcommand!
```

## Step 9: Adding Schematics for File Generation

The real power of extending the NestJS CLI comes from using Schematics to generate and modify files. Let's add a simple schematic that creates a new service.

1.  **Create a schematic file:** Create a directory `schematics` inside `src/cli` and a file `my-service.schematic.ts` inside it:

    ```plaintext
    mkdir src/cli/schematics
    touch src/cli/schematics/my-service.schematic.ts
    ```

    Open `src/cli/schematics/my-service.schematic.ts` and add the following code:

    ```plaintext
    import { Rule, SchematicContext, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics'
    import { normalize, strings } from '@angular-devkit/core'

    interface MyServiceOptions {
      name: string
    }

    export function myService(options: MyServiceOptions): Rule {
      return (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {
        const name = strings.dasherize(options.name) // Convert to kebab-case
        const templateSource = normalize('./files')
        const targetPath = normalize(`src/services/${name}.service.ts`)

        tree.create(
          targetPath,
          `
    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

    @Injectable()
    export class ${strings.classify(name)}Service {
      constructor() {}

      getHello(): string {
        return 'Hello from the ${strings.classify(name)}Service!';
      }
    }
    `
        )

        return tree
      }
    }
    ```

    - This schematic takes a `name` option.
    - It uses `@angular-devkit/schematics` to manipulate the file system. The `strings.dasherize` function converts the name to kebab-case (e.g., "MyService" becomes "my-service"). `strings.classify` converts it to pascal case (e.g., "my-service" becomes "MyService").
    - It creates a new service file at `src/services/${name}.service.ts` with a basic `getHello` method.

2.  **Update `my-custom.command.ts`:** Modify `src/cli/commands/my-custom.command.ts` to use the schematic:

    ```plaintext
    import { Command, CommandRunner, InquirerService } from 'nest-commander'
    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
    import * as chalk from 'chalk'
    import { myService } from '../schematics/my-service.schematic'
    import { SchematicContext, Tree, ExternalSchematicContext } from '@angular-devkit/schematics'
    import { callRule, applyToSubtree, chain, mergeWith } from '@angular-devkit/schematics'

    interface BasicCommandOptions {
      name?: string
      serviceName?: string
    }

    @Injectable()
    @Command({
      name: 'my-custom-command',
      description: 'A custom command to demonstrate extending the NestJS CLI.',
      aliases: ['mcc'], // Optional: Add aliases for your command
    })
    export class MyCustomCommand extends CommandRunner {
      constructor(private readonly inquirer: InquirerService) {
        super()
      }

      async run(passedParams: string[], options?: BasicCommandOptions): Promise<void> {
        let name = options?.name
        let serviceName = options?.serviceName

        if (!name) {
          const answers = await this.inquirer.ask<{ name: string }>('basic-questions', undefined)
          name = answers.name
        }

        if (!serviceName) {
          const answers = await this.inquirer.ask<{ serviceName: string }>(
            'service-name-question',
            undefined
          )
          serviceName = answers.serviceName
        }

        console.log(chalk.green(`Hello, ${name}! This is a custom NestJS CLI command.`))
        console.log(chalk.blue('Executing additional logic...'))

        // Add your custom logic here
        // For example, you could interact with a service, generate files, etc.
        // Run the schematic to create a service
        const tree = Tree.empty()

        const context: SchematicContext = {
          engine: null,
          debug: false,
          logger: console,
          strategy: 0,
        } as SchematicContext

        const rule = myService({ name: serviceName })

        rule(tree, context)

        tree.visit((path, file) => {
          console.log(chalk.green(`Generated file: ${path}`))
        })

        console.log(chalk.yellow('Command execution complete.'))
      }

      async askForMissingParameters(): Promise<BasicCommandOptions> {
        const answers = await this.inquirer.ask<{ name: string; serviceName: string }>(
          [
            {
              type: 'input',
              name: 'name',
              message: 'Please enter your name:',
            },
            {
              type: 'input',
              name: 'serviceName',
              message: 'Please enter the service name:',
            },
          ],
          undefined
        )
        return answers
      }
    }
    ```

    Here's what we changed:

    - Imported the `myService` schematic function.
    - Added a `serviceName` property to the `BasicCommandOptions` interface.
    - Prompted the user for the service name using `inquirer` if it's not provided as an option.
    - Called the `myService` schematic function within the `run` method, passing in the service name.

3.  **Add service name question** Add a service name question to the `cli.prompts.ts` file:

    ```plaintext
    import { QuestionSet } from 'nest-commander'

    @QuestionSet({ name: 'basic-questions' })
    export class BasicQuestions {
      // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type
      getQuestions() {
        return [
          {
            type: 'input',
            name: 'name',
            message: 'Please enter your name:',
          },
        ]
      }
    }

    @QuestionSet({ name: 'service-name-question' })
    export class ServiceNameQuestion {
      getQuestions() {
        return [
          {
            type: 'input',
            name: 'serviceName',
            message: 'Please enter the service name',
          },
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Update AppModule Providers:** Update the `AppModule` providers to include `ServiceNameQuestion`:

    ```plaintext
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
    import { AppController } from './app.controller'
    import { AppService } from './app.service'
    import { CliModule } from './cli/cli.module'
    import { BasicQuestions } from './cli/cli.prompts'
    import { ServiceNameQuestion } from './cli/cli.prompts'

    @Module({
      imports: [CliModule],
      controllers: [AppController],
      providers: [AppService, BasicQuestions, ServiceNameQuestion],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```

5.  **Run the command:**

    ```plaintext
    nest my-custom-command --name="Your Name" --serviceName="MyNewService"
    ```

    Or, without the options:

    ```plaintext
    nest my-custom-command
    ```

    You will be prompted for your name and the service name.

    A new file `src/services/my-new-service.service.ts` will be created with the generated code.

## Conclusion

This guide has shown you how to extend the NestJS CLI to create your own custom commands, including using Schematics to generate files. By leveraging this powerful feature, you can significantly improve developer productivity, enforce project standards, and automate complex tasks within your NestJS projects. Experiment with different Schematics and command options to build a CLI that perfectly fits your specific needs. Remember to consult the official NestJS documentation and `@angular-devkit/schematics` documentation for more advanced features and customization options.
