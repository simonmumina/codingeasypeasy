# @mantine/utils: Your Swiss Army Knife for React Development (Guide + Examples)

The Mantine UI library offers a comprehensive suite of React components and hooks. But beyond the visually stunning and functional components, Mantine provides a powerful set of utility functions bundled within the `@mantine/utils` package. These utilities are designed to simplify common React development tasks, reduce boilerplate code, and improve the overall developer experience.

In this blog post, we'll delve into the `@mantine/utils` package, exploring some of its most useful functions with practical code examples. Whether you're a seasoned React developer or just starting out, this guide will help you leverage `@mantine/utils` to build more efficient and maintainable React applications.

## What is @mantine/utils?

`@mantine/utils` is a collection of utility functions that address common challenges in React development. It provides functions for:

*   **String manipulation:** Converting strings to different cases (camelCase, kebab-case), pluralization, and more.
*   **Object manipulation:** Deep merging objects, filtering object properties.
*   **Type checking:** Validating data types and identifying specific types (e.g., if a value is a function).
*   **Miscellaneous:** Debouncing functions, generating random IDs, and handling responsive values.

The package aims to reduce the need for developers to write custom utility functions for these common tasks, promoting code reusability and consistency across projects.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Mantine installed. If not, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/utils @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/styles
# or
yarn add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/utils @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/styles
```

After installing the core Mantine packages, you can import individual utilities from `@mantine/utils` as needed.

## Key Utility Functions and Examples

Let's explore some of the most useful functions in `@mantine/utils` with practical examples.

### 1. `upperFirst(str: string)`

Capitalizes the first letter of a string.

```javascript
import { upperFirst } from '@mantine/utils';

const myString = 'hello world';
const capitalizedString = upperFirst(myString);

console.log(capitalizedString); // Output: Hello world
```

### 2. `lowerFirst(str: string)`

Lowercases the first letter of a string.

```javascript
import { lowerFirst } from '@mantine/utils';

const myString = 'Hello World';
const lowerCasedString = lowerFirst(myString);

console.log(lowerCasedString); // Output: hello World
```

### 3. `camelCase(str: string)`

Converts a string to camelCase.

```javascript
import { camelCase } from '@mantine/utils';

const myString = 'hello world';
const camelCasedString = camelCase(myString);

console.log(camelCasedString); // Output: helloWorld
```

### 4. `kebabCase(str: string)`

Converts a string to kebab-case.

```javascript
import { kebabCase } from '@mantine/utils';

const myString = 'hello world';
const kebabCasedString = kebabCase(myString);

console.log(kebabCasedString); // Output: hello-world
```

### 5. `mergeDeep<T extends object, U extends object>(target: T, source: U): T & U`

Deeply merges two objects.  This is crucial for handling configuration objects or component styles where you want to override specific properties without losing the existing ones.

```javascript
import { mergeDeep } from '@mantine/utils';

const target = {
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA',
  },
};

const source = {
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
  },
  age: 30,
};

const mergedObject = mergeDeep(target, source);

console.log(mergedObject);
/* Output:
{
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA',
    street: '123 Main St'
  },
  age: 30
}
*/
```

### 6. `filterObject<T extends object>(object: T, predicate: (key: keyof T, value: T[keyof T]) => boolean): Partial<T>`

Filters the properties of an object based on a predicate function.

```javascript
import { filterObject } from '@mantine/utils';

const myObject = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York',
};

const filteredObject = filterObject(myObject, (key, value) => typeof value === 'string');

console.log(filteredObject); // Output: { name: 'John', city: 'New York' }
```

### 7. `isFunction(value: any): value is (...args: any[]) => any`

Checks if a value is a function.  This is essential for validating props and arguments passed to your components.

```javascript
import { isFunction } from '@mantine/utils';

const myFunction = () => {};
const myVariable = 'Hello';

console.log(isFunction(myFunction)); // Output: true
console.log(isFunction(myVariable)); // Output: false
```

### 8.  `debounce<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(fn: T, delay: number, options?: { leading?: boolean; trailing?: boolean }): T`

Debounces a function, ensuring it's only executed after a specified delay.  Useful for handling events like window resizing or input changes to avoid excessive function calls.

```javascript
import { debounce } from '@mantine/utils';

const expensiveOperation = () => {
  console.log('Performing expensive operation');
};

const debouncedOperation = debounce(expensiveOperation, 300);

// Call debouncedOperation multiple times in quick succession
debouncedOperation();
debouncedOperation();
debouncedOperation();

// After 300ms, only one call to expensiveOperation will occur.
```

### 9. `randomId(length?: number): string`

Generates a random ID string.  Useful for creating unique keys for React components or generating temporary identifiers.

```javascript
import { randomId } from '@mantine/utils';

const id1 = randomId();
const id2 = randomId(10); // Specify the length of the ID

console.log(id1); // Output: A random string like "asdfghjkl"
console.log(id2); // Output: A random string of length 10
```

### 10. `getBreakpointValue<T>(value: T | Partial<Record<'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl', T>>, breakpoint: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'): T`

Gets breakpoint value from responsive value based on given breakpoint.  Useful when you need to dynamically adjust values based on the screen size.  Requires that `breakpoints` from `MantineProvider` is available in your context.

```javascript
import { getBreakpointValue } from '@mantine/utils';

const responsiveValue = {
  xs: 10,
  sm: 20,
  md: 30,
  lg: 40,
  xl: 50,
}

console.log(getBreakpointValue(responsiveValue, 'md')); // Output: 30
console.log(getBreakpointValue(responsiveValue, 'xs')); // Output: 10

// If the current breakpoint is larger than the largest defined breakpoint, return the largest defined breakpoint's value.
console.log(getBreakpointValue(responsiveValue, 'xxl')); // Will throw an error that breakpoint is missing.
```

## Benefits of Using @mantine/utils

*   **Reduced Boilerplate:**  Avoid writing common utility functions from scratch.
*   **Code Consistency:** Maintain a consistent coding style across your projects.
*   **Improved Readability:**  Use well-defined functions with clear names, making your code easier to understand.
*   **Type Safety:** TypeScript support ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
*   **Increased Productivity:**  Focus on building features instead of reinventing the wheel.
