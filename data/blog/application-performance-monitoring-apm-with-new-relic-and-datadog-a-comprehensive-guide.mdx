## Setting Up and Configuring APM with New Relic

Let's walk through setting up New Relic APM for a Node.js application.  The process is similar for other languages, but the agent installation will vary.

**1. Create a New Relic Account:**

If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account at [https://newrelic.com/](https://newrelic.com/).

**2. Install the New Relic Agent:**

Install the appropriate agent for your language. For Node.js:

```bash
npm install newrelic --save
```

**3. Configure the Agent:**

Create a `newrelic.js` file in your application's root directory with the following configuration:

```javascript
'use strict'

/**
 * New Relic agent configuration.
 *
 * See lib/config.defaults.js in the agent distribution for a more complete
 * list of configuration variables and their potential values.
 */
exports.config = {
  /**
   * Array of application names.
   */
  app_name: ['My Node.js App'],
  /**
   * Your New Relic license key.
   */
  license_key: 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY',
  logging: {
    /**
     * Level at which to log. 'trace' is most useful to New Relic when diagnosing
     * issues with the agent, 'info' and higher will impose a lower overhead.
     */
    level: 'info'
  },
  /**
   * When true, all request headers except for those listed in attributes.exclude
   * will be sent to New Relic.
   */
  allow_all_headers: true,
  attributes: {
    /**
     * Prefix of attributes to exclude from all harvesting.
     *
     * NOTE: If excluding headers, they must be in lowercase.
     *
     * @env NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE
     */
    exclude: [
      'request.headers.cookie',
      'request.headers.authorization',
      'request.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'request.headers.setCookie*',
      'request.headers.x*',
      'response.headers.cookie',
      'response.headers.authorization',
      'response.headers.proxyAuthorization',
      'response.headers.setCookie*'
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` with your actual New Relic license key.

**4. Require the Agent in Your Application:**

In your application's entry point (e.g., `index.js`, `app.js`), require the New Relic agent *before* any other modules:

```javascript
require('newrelic');

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

**5. Deploy and Run Your Application:**

Deploy your application and generate some traffic.  Within a few minutes, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI.

**6. Explore the New Relic UI:**

Log in to your New Relic account and navigate to APM. You'll see dashboards showing key metrics such as:

*   **Response Time:**  The average time it takes for your application to respond to requests.
*   **Throughput:**  The number of requests your application is handling per minute.
*   **Error Rate:**  The percentage of requests that result in errors.
*   **Transaction Traces:**  Detailed breakdowns of individual requests, showing the time spent in different parts of your code.
*   **Database Query Performance:**  Insights into slow queries and database resource utilization.

## Setting Up and Configuring APM with Datadog

Now let's set up Datadog APM for a Python application.

**1. Create a Datadog Account:**

Sign up for a Datadog account at [https://www.datadoghq.com/](https://www.datadoghq.com/).

**2. Install the Datadog Agent:**

Follow the instructions on the Datadog website to install the Datadog Agent on your server.  This involves downloading and running an installation script specific to your operating system.

**3. Install the Datadog Tracer for Python:**

```bash
pip install ddtrace
```

**4. Configure the Tracer:**

There are several ways to configure the Datadog Tracer for Python. One common approach is to use environment variables:

```bash
export DD_SERVICE=my-python-app
export DD_ENV=production
export DD_AGENT_HOST=localhost # Or the actual hostname/IP of your Datadog agent
export DD_TRACE_ENABLED=true
```

**5. Instrument Your Code:**

You need to instrument your code to tell Datadog which parts of your application to trace. You can do this manually or use auto-instrumentation.

**Manual Instrumentation:**

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

@tracer.wrap()
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Example of tracing a web request (using Flask):
from flask import Flask
from ddtrace import patch, tracer

patch(flask=True) # Auto-instrument flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    with tracer.trace('web.request'):  # Trace a specific code block
        return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Auto-Instrumentation:**

Datadog provides auto-instrumentation libraries for many popular Python frameworks.  For Flask, you can simply call `ddtrace.patch(flask=True)` as shown in the example above. For other frameworks, refer to the Datadog documentation.

**6. Deploy and Run Your Application:**

Deploy your application and generate some traffic.  Within a few minutes, you should start seeing data in the Datadog UI.

**7. Explore the Datadog UI:**

Log in to your Datadog account and navigate to the APM section. You'll see dashboards showing key metrics such as:

*   **Latency:** The time it takes for your application to respond to requests.
*   **Request Rate:** The number of requests your application is handling per second.
*   **Error Rate:** The percentage of requests that result in errors.
*   **Trace Analytics:**  Detailed breakdowns of individual requests, showing the time spent in different services and code blocks.
*   **Service Maps:**  Visual representations of your application's architecture, showing the dependencies between different services.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

Regardless of which APM tool you choose, here are some key metrics to focus on:

*   **Response Time (Latency):**  The time it takes for your application to respond to requests.  Pay attention to average, median, and 95th percentile response times.  High latency can indicate bottlenecks in your code, database, or network.
*   **Throughput (Request Rate):**  The number of requests your application is handling per unit of time.  A sudden drop in throughput can indicate an outage or performance degradation.
*   **Error Rate:**  The percentage of requests that result in errors.  High error rates can indicate bugs in your code or problems with your infrastructure.
*   **CPU Utilization:**  The percentage of CPU resources being used by your application.  High CPU utilization can indicate that your application is under heavy load or that there are inefficiencies in your code.
*   **Memory Utilization:**  The amount of memory being used by your application.  High memory utilization can indicate memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.
*   **Database Query Time:**  The time it takes to execute database queries.  Slow queries are a common source of performance bottlenecks.
*   **External Service Latency:** The time it takes for your application to communicate with external services (e.g., APIs, databases).

## Best Practices for Effective APM

*   **Proactive Monitoring:**  Don't wait for problems to occur.  Implement APM from the start and monitor your application continuously.
*   **Set Up Alerts:**  Configure alerts to notify you when key metrics exceed predefined thresholds. This allows you to proactively address issues before they impact users.
*   **Use Transaction Traces:**  When you encounter a performance problem, use transaction traces to identify the root cause.  Drill down into individual requests to see where time is being spent.
*   **Monitor Database Performance:**  Pay close attention to database query performance.  Identify slow queries and optimize them.
*   **Monitor External Service Dependencies:**  Track the performance of external services to identify potential bottlenecks.
*   **Integrate APM into Your CI/CD Pipeline:**  Automate the process of deploying and configuring APM agents.
*   **Regularly Review and Optimize Your APM Configuration:** As your application evolves, you'll need to adjust your APM configuration to ensure that you're monitoring the right metrics and getting the insights you need.
*   **Correlate Metrics:**  Look for correlations between different metrics to identify the root cause of performance problems. For example, a spike in CPU utilization might be correlated with a surge in request rate or a slowdown in database query time.
*   **Establish Baselines:**  Establish baselines for key metrics so you can quickly identify anomalies.

## Code Examples for Custom Instrumentation

While auto-instrumentation is helpful, sometimes you need to add custom instrumentation to capture specific details about your application's behavior. Here are some examples:

**New Relic (Node.js):**

```javascript
const newrelic = require('newrelic');

function myCustomFunction(data) {
  newrelic.startSegment('myCustomFunction', true, function() {
    // Your code here
    // ...

    newrelic.addCustomAttribute('data_size', data.length); // Add custom attribute

    // End the segment
    newrelic.endSegment();
  });
}
```

**Datadog (Python):**

```python
from ddtrace import tracer

with tracer.trace('my_custom_operation'):
    # Your code here
    # ...
    tracer.current_span().set_tag('data_size', len(data)) # Add custom tag
```

These examples show how to use the APM APIs to create custom traces and add attributes or tags that provide more context to your performance data.
