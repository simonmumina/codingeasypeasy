# Securing Apache Against DDoS Attacks: A Comprehensive Guide

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a constant threat to online businesses and organizations. These attacks aim to overwhelm a server with malicious traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.  Apache, being one of the most popular web servers, is a frequent target.  This comprehensive guide provides proven techniques to protect your Apache web server from DDoS attacks and maintain its availability.

## Understanding DDoS Attacks

Before diving into mitigation strategies, it's crucial to understand the different types of DDoS attacks:

*   **Volume-Based Attacks:**  Flood the server with large amounts of traffic, consuming bandwidth and overwhelming network resources. Examples include UDP floods, ICMP floods, and HTTP floods.

*   **Protocol Attacks:** Exploit weaknesses in network protocols to consume server resources.  Examples include SYN floods and Smurf attacks.

*   **Application-Layer Attacks:** Target specific application vulnerabilities to overwhelm the server with seemingly legitimate requests. Examples include HTTP GET floods, POST floods, and slowloris attacks.  These are often more difficult to detect because the traffic can mimic normal user activity.

## Essential Mitigation Techniques

Here's a detailed breakdown of techniques you can implement to protect your Apache server from DDoS attacks:

### 1.  Rate Limiting

Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame. This can effectively mitigate HTTP floods and other application-layer attacks.

**a) Using `mod_ratelimit` (Apache 2.4 and above):**

Apache's built-in `mod_ratelimit` allows you to control the bandwidth used by clients.  While primarily designed for bandwidth throttling, it indirectly limits the number of requests per second.

First, enable the module:

```bash
sudo a2enmod ratelimit
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Then, configure it in your `VirtualHost` configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/sites-available/your_site.conf`):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com

    <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com>
        <IfModule mod_ratelimit.c>
            SetOutputFilter RATE_LIMIT
            RateLimitExempt text/html
            RateLimit 10240 # 10 KB/s per client
        </IfModule>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

This configuration limits each client to 10KB/s. Adjust the `RateLimit` value based on your needs and website traffic. The `RateLimitExempt` directive prevents rate limiting for HTML files. This is important because HTML is the "structure" of the website and you want it to always be available without artificial delays.  If you are serving other types of content (images, videos, etc) you might choose to exempt them as well.

**b) Using `mod_qos` (More Advanced Rate Limiting):**

`mod_qos` provides more fine-grained control over request handling.  It allows you to limit requests based on various criteria, such as IP address, URL, and HTTP headers.

Installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-qos # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install mod_qos # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo a2enmod qos
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Configuration (example in `/etc/apache2/mods-available/qos.conf` or a specific VirtualHost):

```apache
<IfModule mod_qos.c>
    # Limits the number of connections from the same IP address
    QS_ClientEntries      2000
    QS_SrvMaxConnClose     50
    QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP    10
    QS_LocRequestLimit     50 10
    QS_SrvMinDataRate     150 1200
    QS_SrvMaxClients       100
    QS_ClientBlockLimit    200
    QS_ClientBlockTime     300
</IfModule>
```

*   `QS_ClientEntries`: Maximum number of client IP address entries tracked.
*   `QS_SrvMaxConnClose`: Max connections to close per second
*   `QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP`: Maximum concurrent connections allowed from a single IP.
*   `QS_LocRequestLimit`:  Allows 50 requests within a 10-second window.  After this limit is reached, subsequent requests are delayed.
*   `QS_SrvMinDataRate`: Minimum data rate (bytes/second) required for a connection to remain open.  This helps prevent slowloris attacks. (bytes/second and minimum time)
*   `QS_SrvMaxClients`: Total number of concurrent clients that can be served.
*   `QS_ClientBlockLimit`: Number of QS_LocRequestLimit violations before blocking
*   `QS_ClientBlockTime`: time to block client in seconds

**Important:** Carefully tune `mod_qos` parameters based on your website's traffic patterns.  Overly restrictive settings can block legitimate users.

### 2. Using `mod_evasive`

`mod_evasive` is designed specifically to mitigate HTTP DoS and brute-force attacks. It detects excessive requests from a single IP address and blocks them.

Installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-evasive # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install mod_evasive # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo a2enmod evasive
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Configuration (`/etc/apache2/mods-available/evasive.conf`):

```apache
<IfModule mod_evasive20.c>
    DOSHashTableSize    3097
    DOSPageInterval     1
    DOSSiteInterval     1
    DOSPageCount        2
    DOSSiteCount        5
    DOSBlockDir         "/var/log/mod_evasive"
    DOSLogDir           "/var/log/mod_evasive"
    DOSEmailNotify      youremail@example.com
    DOSWhitelist        127.0.0.1
    DOSWhitelist        192.168.1.0/24
</IfModule>
```

*   `DOSHashTableSize`:  Size of the hash table used to track IP addresses. A prime number is recommended.
*   `DOSPageInterval`: Interval (in seconds) for checking the number of requests to a single page.
*   `DOSSiteInterval`: Interval (in seconds) for checking the total number of requests to the site.
*   `DOSPageCount`: Number of requests allowed to a single page within `DOSPageInterval`.
*   `DOSSiteCount`: Number of requests allowed to the entire site within `DOSSiteInterval`.
*   `DOSBlockDir`: Directory where blocked IP addresses are stored.  Ensure Apache has write permissions to this directory.
*   `DOSLogDir`:  Directory for log files.
*   `DOSEmailNotify`: Email address to receive notifications when an IP is blocked.
*   `DOSWhitelist`:  IP addresses or networks to exclude from blocking. Add your local network and trusted bots.  Use CIDR notation for network ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

**Key Considerations for `mod_evasive`:**

*   **False Positives:**  Adjust `DOSPageCount` and `DOSSiteCount` carefully to avoid blocking legitimate users.
*   **Log Analysis:** Regularly review the contents of `DOSBlockDir` and your Apache error logs to identify potential false positives and fine-tune the configuration.
*   **Centralized Logging:**  Consider using a centralized logging system to correlate events across multiple servers.

### 3. Web Application Firewall (WAF) with `mod_security`

`mod_security` is a powerful WAF that inspects HTTP traffic and blocks malicious requests based on defined rules. It can protect against a wide range of attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and, indirectly, some DDoS attempts.

Installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2 # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install mod_security # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo a2enmod security2
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Configuration:

`mod_security` requires a robust ruleset.  The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a popular and comprehensive option.

1.  **Download the OWASP CRS:**

    ```bash
    cd /etc/apache2/modsecurity.d
    sudo wget https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/archive/v3.3.5.tar.gz
    sudo tar -xvzf v3.3.5.tar.gz
    sudo mv coreruleset-3.3.5 crs
    rm v3.3.5.tar.gz
    sudo cp crs/crs-setup.conf.example crs/crs-setup.conf
    ```

2.  **Configure `mod_security` to use the CRS:**

    Edit `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/security2.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/mod_security.conf` (depending on your distribution) and add these lines:

    ```apache
    <IfModule security2_module>
        IncludeOptional /etc/apache2/modsecurity.d/crs/crs-setup.conf
        IncludeOptional /etc/apache2/modsecurity.d/crs/rules/*.conf
    </IfModule>
    ```

3.  **Enable ModSecurity's engine:**

    Edit `/etc/apache2/modsecurity.d/crs/crs-setup.conf` and find the line:

    ```
    SecAction "id:900000, phase:1,nolog, pass, t:none, setvar:tx.crs_setup_version=335"
    ```

    Just below it add (or uncomment if already there but commented out):

    ```
    SecRuleEngine On
    ```

    **Important:**  Set `SecRuleEngine` to `DetectionOnly` initially to monitor traffic and identify potential false positives.  After thorough testing, switch it to `On` to enable blocking. You may also want to set `SecDebugLogLevel` to `3` or higher for detailed logging during initial setup and testing, but remember to lower it for production to avoid performance overhead.

4. **Configure `modsecurity` to include your local customizations.**
    Create a file called `000_local_rules.conf` in `/etc/apache2/modsecurity.d/` or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/mod_security.d/`.  Add rules that fit your local setup.  For instance, you might create a rule to block access based on country code:

    ```apache
    SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@geoLookup" "chain,id:1000,phase:1,t:none,deny,status:403,msg:'Access denied from this country'"
        SecRule GEO:COUNTRY_CODE "@streq XX" "t:none"
    ```
    **Important**:  You will need to enable the `mod_geoip` module and install the GeoIP database in order for this rule to work.  Replace `XX` with the country code you wish to block.

**Key Considerations for `mod_security`:**

*   **False Positives:**  `mod_security` can sometimes block legitimate requests.  Carefully review the logs and tune the ruleset to minimize false positives. The CRS has numerous configuration options available in `crs-setup.conf` that allows you to customise the rules and exceptions.
*   **Performance Impact:** `mod_security` can add some overhead to request processing. Monitor server performance and adjust the configuration accordingly.
*   **Rule Updates:** Regularly update the OWASP CRS to stay protected against the latest threats.  Consider using a script or automated process to keep the ruleset up-to-date.
*   **Learning Mode:** Some commercial WAF solutions offer a "learning mode" that analyzes traffic patterns and automatically creates custom rules to address specific threats.  This feature can significantly simplify WAF management.

### 4.  Firewall Configuration

A firewall acts as a barrier between your server and the outside world, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.  Using a firewall is a critical first line of defense against DDoS attacks.

**a) Using `iptables` (Linux):**

`iptables` is a powerful command-line firewall tool available on most Linux distributions.

**Example configurations:**

*   **Limit incoming SYN packets (SYN flood protection):**

    ```bash
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -m limit --limit 1/s --limit-burst 1 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -j DROP
    ```

    This configuration allows one SYN packet per second and drops any subsequent SYN packets.  Adjust the `--limit` value based on your expected traffic.

*   **Drop invalid packets:**

    ```bash
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP
    ```

*   **Limit ICMP traffic (ICMP flood protection):**

    ```bash
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 1/s --limit-burst 1 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP
    ```

**b) Using `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall - Debian/Ubuntu):**

`ufw` is a user-friendly interface for managing `iptables`.

**Example configurations:**

*   **Allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic:**

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    sudo ufw allow http
    sudo ufw allow https
    sudo ufw enable
    ```

*   **Rate limiting with `ufw` (using `iptables` backend):**

    `ufw` can be extended with custom rules to implement rate limiting using `iptables`.  Create a file (e.g., `/etc/ufw/before.rules`) and add the following lines *before* the `COMMIT` line:

    ```
    # Rate limiting for HTTP traffic
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -m recent --set --name HTTP --rsource
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 --name HTTP --rsource -j LOG --log-prefix "HTTP Rate Limit Exceeded: "
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 --name HTTP --rsource -j DROP

    # Rate limiting for HTTPS traffic
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -m recent --set --name HTTPS --rsource
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 --name HTTPS --rsource -j LOG --log-prefix "HTTPS Rate Limit Exceeded: "
    -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 --name HTTPS --rsource -j DROP
    ```

    This configuration limits clients to 10 HTTP(S) requests per minute.  Adjust the `--hitcount` and `--seconds` values as needed.  Restart `ufw` to apply the changes: `sudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable`.  Make sure you allow your existing ssh connections before restarting ufw.  You can do this by running `sudo ufw allow <your_ip>/32` from your current ssh session.

**c) Cloud Firewalls:**

Cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure offer managed firewall services (e.g., AWS WAF, Google Cloud Armor, Azure Firewall) that provide more advanced DDoS protection capabilities, including:

*   **Automatic Traffic Filtering:**  Intelligent traffic analysis to identify and block malicious requests.
*   **Scalability:**  Automatically scale to handle large traffic volumes.
*   **Geo-blocking:**  Block traffic from specific countries.
*   **Integration with other security services:**  Integration with threat intelligence feeds and other security solutions.

### 5.  Reverse Proxy and Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A reverse proxy sits in front of your Apache server, acting as an intermediary between clients and the server.  A CDN distributes your website's content across multiple servers around the world, reducing the load on your origin server and improving performance for users in different geographic locations.  Both can help mitigate DDoS attacks:

*   **Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx, Varnish):**
    *   Absorbs some of the malicious traffic, protecting the origin server.
    *   Provides caching capabilities, reducing the load on the origin server.
    *   Offers advanced traffic management features, such as rate limiting and request filtering.
*   **CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront):**
    *   Distributes traffic across multiple servers, making it more difficult to overwhelm the origin server.
    *   Caches static content, reducing the load on the origin server.
    *   Provides DDoS protection services, such as automatic traffic filtering and rate limiting.
    *   Offers global Anycast network, meaning that requests are routed to the nearest CDN edge server, minimizing latency.

### 6.  Server Hardening

General server hardening practices can improve the overall security of your Apache server and reduce its vulnerability to attacks:

*   **Keep your operating system and software up-to-date:** Regularly install security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Disable unnecessary services:**  Disable any services that are not required for your website to function.
*   **Use strong passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts.
*   **Implement two-factor authentication:**  Enable two-factor authentication for administrator accounts.
*   **Regularly back up your data:**  Regularly back up your data to protect against data loss in case of a successful attack.
*   **Monitor server logs:**  Regularly monitor server logs for suspicious activity.  Use tools like `fail2ban` to automatically block IPs that exhibit suspicious behavior.

### 7.  Kernel Tuning

Adjusting kernel parameters can help improve the performance and security of your Apache server:

*   **Increase the maximum number of open file descriptors:**

    ```bash
    # /etc/sysctl.conf
    fs.file-max = 65535
    ```

    Apply the changes: `sudo sysctl -p`

*   **Increase the TCP SYN backlog:**

    ```bash
    # /etc/sysctl.conf
    net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8192
    net.core.somaxconn = 8192
    ```

    Apply the changes: `sudo sysctl -p`

*   **Enable TCP SYN cookies:**

    ```bash
    # /etc/sysctl.conf
    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
    ```

    Apply the changes: `sudo sysctl -p`

### 8.  Monitoring and Alerting

Implement a robust monitoring and alerting system to detect and respond to DDoS attacks quickly.

*   **Monitor server resource utilization:**  Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.
*   **Monitor Apache access logs:**  Look for suspicious patterns, such as excessive requests from a single IP address or unusual HTTP status codes.
*   **Set up alerts:**  Configure alerts to notify you when server resource utilization exceeds certain thresholds or when suspicious activity is detected.
*   **Use intrusion detection systems (IDS):**  Implement an IDS to detect and respond to malicious activity.
*   **Consider Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:** These systems centralize security logs from multiple sources and allow for advanced analysis and correlation of events to detect and respond to threats.

## Choosing the Right Approach

The best approach to securing your Apache server against DDoS attacks depends on several factors, including:

*   **Your budget:** Cloud-based DDoS protection services can be expensive.
*   **Your technical expertise:** Implementing and managing some of the techniques described in this guide requires significant technical expertise.
*   **Your website's traffic patterns:**  You need to understand your website's traffic patterns to properly configure rate limiting and other security measures.
*   **The type of DDoS attacks you are most likely to face:**  Different types of attacks require different mitigation strategies.

A combination of these techniques is often the most effective approach.  Start with the basics, such as firewall configuration and server hardening, and then implement more advanced techniques as needed.

## Conclusion

Protecting your Apache server from DDoS attacks is an ongoing process. Regularly review your security measures and adapt them to the changing threat landscape.  By implementing the techniques described in this guide, you can significantly reduce your risk of a successful DDoS attack and maintain the availability of your website. Remember to test all changes in a staging environment before deploying them to production. Good luck!
