# FastAPI Middleware: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples

FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints, offers a powerful and elegant way to handle requests through its middleware system. Middleware functions sit in the request-response cycle, allowing you to intercept and modify incoming requests or outgoing responses. This makes them invaluable for tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, request validation, and more.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamentals of FastAPI middleware, covering different methods of implementation and providing practical code examples to illustrate their usage.

## What is Middleware?

Think of middleware as a chain of functions that execute before or after your main route handlers. Each middleware function has the opportunity to:

- **Modify the incoming request:** Add headers, validate data, modify the request body.
- **Execute code before processing the request:** Perform authentication, authorization checks, logging.
- **Execute code after processing the request:** Modify the response, log the response, add security headers.
- **Handle exceptions:** Catch exceptions raised by your route handlers or other middleware.

## Why Use Middleware in FastAPI?

Middleware provides a structured and reusable way to handle common tasks across your API endpoints. Here are some key benefits:

- **Code Reusability:** Avoid repeating the same logic in multiple route handlers.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep your route handlers focused on core business logic, delegating tasks like authentication and logging to middleware.
- **Centralized Control:** Manage cross-cutting concerns in a single place, making it easier to maintain and update your application.
- **Improved Security:** Enforce security policies consistently across your API.
- **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring:** Easily track request and response details for debugging and performance analysis.

## Methods for Adding Middleware in FastAPI

FastAPI offers several ways to add middleware:

1.  **Using the `add_middleware` method:** This is the most common and flexible approach, allowing you to register middleware functions to the FastAPI application instance.
2.  **Using lifespan events:** While primarily for setup and teardown, lifespan events can be used in conjunction with dependency injection to set up global state accessible to middleware.
3.  **Subclassing `BaseHTTPMiddleware`:** Create a custom middleware class that inherits from `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, giving you greater control over the middleware's behavior.

Let's explore each method in detail with code examples.

### 1. Using the `add_middleware` Method

The `add_middleware` method is the primary way to register middleware. It takes two arguments:

- `middleware_class`: The middleware class, typically `starlette.middleware.base.BaseHTTPMiddleware` or a custom subclass.
- `dispatch`: The middleware function that will be executed for each request.

Here's a basic example of a middleware that logs the request path and processing time:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import time

app = FastAPI()

async def log_request_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
  """Logs the request path and processing time."""
  start_time = time.time()
  response = await call_next(request)  # Process the request
  process_time = time.time() - start_time
  print(f"Request to {request.url.path} took {process_time:.4f} seconds")
  return response

app.middleware("http")(log_request_middleware)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
  return {"item_id": item_id}
```

**Explanation:**

- `log_request_middleware` is an `async` function that takes a `Request` object and the `call_next` function as arguments.
- `call_next(request)` is an `async` function that passes the request to the next middleware or the route handler. It returns the `Response` object.
- We log the request path and processing time before and after calling `call_next`.
- `app.middleware("http")(log_request_middleware)` registers the middleware to the application. The `http` argument specifies that this middleware applies to HTTP requests.

**How to run:**

1.  Save the code as `main.py`.
2.  Install FastAPI and Uvicorn: `pip install fastapi uvicorn`
3.  Run the application: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
4.  Access the endpoints (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/1`)

You'll see the request path and processing time printed to the console for each request.

### 2. Using Lifespan Events (with Dependency Injection)

While not directly adding middleware in the traditional sense, lifespan events allow you to initialize global state that can be accessed and used by middleware. This is especially useful for setting up database connections, configuration settings, or other resources that your middleware functions might need.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Depends
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from typing import AsyncGenerator

# Global state (e.g., a database connection)
database_connection = None

async def get_db():
  """Dependency injection function to access the database connection."""
  return database_connection

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
  """Lifespan event to initialize and close the database connection."""
  global database_connection  # Access the global variable
  database_connection = "Connected to the database!"  # Simulate database connection
  yield
  database_connection = None  # Simulate closing the database connection
  print("Database connection closed.")

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

async def database_middleware(request: Request, call_next, db=Depends(get_db)):
  """Middleware to check database availability."""
  if db is None:
    return {"error": "Database connection unavailable"}
  response = await call_next(request)
  return response

app.middleware("http")(database_middleware)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root(db=Depends(get_db)):
  return {"message": f"Hello World. Database status: {db}"}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `lifespan` function uses the `@asynccontextmanager` decorator to handle the application startup and shutdown.
- Inside `lifespan`, we simulate connecting to a database and store the connection in the global variable `database_connection`.
- We then `yield` to allow the application to start processing requests. After the application shuts down, the code after the `yield` is executed, simulating closing the database connection.
- The `get_db` function uses `Depends` to inject the database connection into the route handler and the middleware.
- The `database_middleware` uses the injected `db` dependency to check if the database connection is available. If not, it returns an error.
- We register the middleware using `app.middleware("http")(database_middleware)`.

This approach allows you to initialize resources like database connections only once during application startup, making them readily available to your middleware functions.

### 3. Subclassing `BaseHTTPMiddleware`

This method provides the most control and flexibility over your middleware. You create a custom class that inherits from `BaseHTTPMiddleware` and define a `dispatch` method that handles the request.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from starlette.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

class AuthenticationMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
  async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
    """Performs authentication logic."""
    # Simulate authentication check
    auth_token = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if auth_token != "Bearer valid_token":
      return {"error": "Unauthorized"}, 401  # Return a 401 Unauthorized response

    response = await call_next(request)
    return response

app = FastAPI(middleware=[Middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware)])


@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/protected")
async def read_protected():
  return {"message": "This is a protected resource"}
```

**Explanation:**

- We create a class `AuthenticationMiddleware` that inherits from `BaseHTTPMiddleware`.
- The `dispatch` method takes the `Request` object and the `call_next` function as arguments.
- We simulate an authentication check by verifying the presence of a valid `Authorization` header. If the authentication fails, we return a 401 Unauthorized response.
- If the authentication succeeds, we call `call_next` to process the request.
- When creating the FastAPI application, we pass a list of `Middleware` objects to the `middleware` parameter. Each `Middleware` object specifies the middleware class.

**Key differences from `add_middleware`:**

- The middleware is registered directly in the FastAPI app constructor, rather than through the `add_middleware` function.
- You create a class, allowing you to encapsulate more complex middleware logic and potentially store state within the middleware class itself (although be mindful of the single-instance nature of middleware - thread safety considerations apply if modifying state).

## Real-World Middleware Examples

Here are some practical examples of how you can use middleware in your FastAPI applications:

### 1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS is a crucial security feature for web applications that interact with resources from different origins. FastAPI provides a built-in middleware for handling CORS.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

origins = [
    "http://localhost",
    "http://localhost:8080",
    "https://your-frontend-domain.com",
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allows all methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allows all headers
)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

**Explanation:**

- We import `CORSMiddleware` from `fastapi.middleware.cors`.
- We define a list of allowed origins (`origins`).
- We add the `CORSMiddleware` to the application using `app.add_middleware`, configuring the allowed origins, credentials, methods, and headers.

### 2. Authentication

Middleware can be used to authenticate users before they can access protected resources. This example demonstrates a simple token-based authentication.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

class AuthenticationMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
  async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
    auth_token = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if auth_token != "Bearer valid_token":
      return {"error": "Unauthorized"}, 401  # 401 Unauthorized
    response = await call_next(request)
    return response

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(AuthenticationMiddleware)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
  return {"message": "Public endpoint"}

@app.get("/protected")
async def read_protected():
  return {"message": "This is a protected resource.  Authenticated!"}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `AuthenticationMiddleware` checks for an `Authorization` header with a "Bearer" token.
- If the token is invalid, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response.
- If the token is valid, it calls `call_next` to proceed with the request.

### 3. Request Validation

You can use middleware to validate incoming requests before they reach your route handlers. This can help prevent errors and improve security.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
  name: str
  price: float

app = FastAPI()

async def validation_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
  """Validates the request body."""
  if request.url.path == "/items" and request.method == "POST":
    try:
      body = await request.json()
      Item(**body)  # Validate using Pydantic model
    except Exception as e:
      raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
  response = await call_next(request)
  return response

app.middleware("http")(validation_middleware)

@app.post("/items")
async def create_item(item: Item):
  return item
```

**Explanation:**

- The `validation_middleware` checks if the request is a POST request to the `/items` endpoint.
- It reads the request body as JSON.
- It uses the `Item` Pydantic model to validate the data.
- If the validation fails, it raises an `HTTPException` with a 400 Bad Request status code.

### 4. Logging

Middleware can be used to log request and response details for auditing and debugging purposes.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

app = FastAPI()

async def logging_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
  """Logs request and response details."""
  logger.info(f"Request: {request.method} {request.url}")
  response = await call_next(request)
  logger.info(f"Response: {response.status_code}")
  return response

app.middleware("http")(logging_middleware)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `logging_middleware` logs the request method, URL, and response status code.
- It uses the `logging` module to write the logs to the console.

## Ordering Middleware

The order in which you add middleware matters. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are registered. For example, you might want to run an authentication middleware before a logging middleware to ensure that only authenticated requests are logged.

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

async def middleware_1(request: Request, call_next):
  print("Middleware 1: Before request")
  response = await call_next(request)
  print("Middleware 1: After response")
  return response

async def middleware_2(request: Request, call_next):
  print("Middleware 2: Before request")
  response = await call_next(request)
  print("Middleware 2: After response")
  return response

app.middleware("http")(middleware_1)
app.middleware("http")(middleware_2)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
  return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

In this example, `middleware_1` will be executed before `middleware_2`. The output will be:

```
Middleware 1: Before request
Middleware 2: Before request
Middleware 2: After response
Middleware 1: After response
```

If you reverse the order in which you add the middleware, the execution order will also be reversed.

## Best Practices

- **Keep middleware functions focused:** Each middleware function should handle a specific task.
- **Use dependency injection:** Inject dependencies like database connections or configuration settings into your middleware functions to improve testability and maintainability.
- **Handle exceptions gracefully:** Catch exceptions raised by your middleware functions and return appropriate error responses.
- **Consider middleware order:** Ensure that your middleware functions are executed in the correct order to achieve the desired behavior.
- **Test your middleware thoroughly:** Write unit tests to ensure that your middleware functions are working as expected.
- **Document your middleware:** Clearly document the purpose and functionality of each middleware function.
