# Svelte Easing Functions: Create Custom Animations with Ease

Svelte provides a powerful and intuitive way to create animations for your web applications. While Svelte comes with a variety of built-in easing functions, sometimes you need something more tailored to your specific needs. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating custom easing functions in Svelte, allowing you to craft truly unique and engaging user experiences.

## What are Easing Functions?

Easing functions, also known as timing functions, control the rate of change of a parameter over time. In the context of animation, they determine how smoothly an animation transitions from its starting point to its ending point. Instead of a linear transition, which feels robotic and unnatural, easing functions create a more organic and visually appealing movement.

Think of it like a ball rolling down a hill. A linear easing would be like the ball rolling at a constant speed. An ease-in easing would be like the ball starting slowly and then speeding up as it goes down the hill. An ease-out easing would be like the ball starting fast and then slowing down as it reaches the bottom.

## Built-in Easing Functions in Svelte

Svelte provides a selection of commonly used easing functions through the `svelte/easing` module. Some popular options include:

- **`linear`**: A constant rate of change, resulting in a basic linear animation.
- **`quad`**: Ease in/out with a quadratic curve.
- **`cubic`**: Ease in/out with a cubic curve.
- **`quart`**: Ease in/out with a quartic curve.
- **`quint`**: Ease in/out with a quintic curve.
- **`expo`**: Ease in/out with an exponential curve.
- **`sine`**: Ease in/out with a sine wave curve.
- **`circle`**: Ease in/out with a circular curve.
- **`elastic`**: Creates a springy, elastic effect.
- **`back`**: Creates an anticipation effect (going backwards slightly before moving forward).
- **`bounce`**: Creates a bouncing effect.

You can import these directly into your Svelte components:

```svelte
<script>
  import { sineInOut } from 'svelte/easing';
  import { tweened } from 'svelte/motion';

  const progress = tweened(0, {
    duration: 1000,
    easing: sineInOut
  });

  $: width = $progress * 100;
</script>

<progress value={width} max="100"></progress>
```

In this example, `sineInOut` is used to control the easing of a progress bar animation created with `tweened`. The progress bar will start and end its animation smoothly, thanks to the sine wave curve.

## Why Create Custom Easing Functions?

While Svelte's built-in easing functions cover many common animation needs, there are several compelling reasons to create your own:

- **Unique Visual Style:** Custom easing functions allow you to create a distinctive visual style for your animations, setting your application apart.
- **Fine-Grained Control:** You have complete control over the timing and trajectory of your animations, enabling you to achieve specific effects that built-in functions can't replicate.
- **Complex Animations:** For more complex animations, you might need easing functions that combine multiple curves or behaviors.
- **Optimized Performance:** While less common, in very specific scenarios, a custom easing function could be optimized for a particular animation to improve performance.
- **Fun and Experimentation:** Creating easing functions is a great way to deepen your understanding of animation principles and explore creative possibilities.

## Implementing Custom Easing Functions in Svelte

A custom easing function in Svelte is simply a JavaScript function that takes a number between 0 and 1 as input (representing the normalized time of the animation) and returns a number between 0 and 1 (representing the normalized output value).

Here's the basic structure:

```plaintext
function customEasing(t) {
  // t: Normalized time (0 to 1)
  // Return value: Normalized output value (0 to 1)
  return t; // Example: Linear easing
}
```

The `t` value represents the progress of the animation, starting at 0 (beginning) and ending at 1 (end). Your easing function needs to transform this value to create the desired easing effect.

Let's create a simple easing function that emphasizes the beginning of the animation:

```plaintext
function easeInEmphasis(t) {
  return t * t * t; // Cubic ease-in
}
```

This function cubes the input value. Since values between 0 and 1 get smaller when raised to a power, the animation will progress more slowly at the beginning and then speed up towards the end.

Here's how you would use this in a Svelte component:

```svelte
<script>
  import { tweened } from 'svelte/motion';

  function easeInEmphasis(t) {
    return t * t * t; // Cubic ease-in
  }

  const progress = tweened(0, {
    duration: 1000,
    easing: easeInEmphasis
  });

  $: width = $progress * 100;
</script>

<progress value={width} max="100"></progress>

<button on:click={() => $progress = 1}>Animate</button>
```

Now, let's explore some more advanced easing function examples.

### Example 1: Ease-Out Bounce

This function creates a bounce effect at the end of the animation.

```plaintext
function easeOutBounce(t) {
  const n1 = 7.5625;
  const d1 = 2.75;

  if (t < 1 / d1) {
    return n1 * t * t;
  } else if (t < 2 / d1) {
    return n1 * (t -= (1.5 / d1)) * t + 0.75;
  } else if (t < 2.5 / d1) {
    return n1 * (t -= (2.25 / d1)) * t + 0.9375;
  } else {
    return n1 * (t -= (2.625 / d1)) * t + 0.984375;
  }
}
```

This function uses a series of conditional statements to calculate the output value based on different stages of the animation. This creates the bouncing effect. You would use it just like the previous example, swapping out `easeInEmphasis` with `easeOutBounce`.

### Example 2: Back Ease In/Out

This function creates an anticipation effect, where the animation briefly moves in the opposite direction before moving in the desired direction.

```plaintext
function backInOut(t) {
    const s = 1.70158 * 1.525;
    if ((t *= 2) < 1) {
        return 0.5 * (t * t * ((s + 1) * t - s));
    }
    return 0.5 * ((t -= 2) * t * ((s + 1) * t + s) + 2);
}
```

This example uses a different formula to manipulate the input value. The `s` variable controls the amount of the "back" movement. Experimenting with different `s` values will change the visual feel of the animation.

### Visualizing Easing Functions

Understanding the shape of an easing function can greatly help in creating the desired animation effect. You can visualize easing functions using graphing tools or online easing function generators. These tools allow you to see the curve of the function and how it affects the animation. This visual feedback can be invaluable in tweaking your custom easing functions.

### Tips for Creating Effective Easing Functions

- **Start Simple:** Begin with basic formulas and gradually add complexity as needed.
- **Experiment and Iterate:** Don't be afraid to try different formulas and adjust parameters until you achieve the desired effect.
- **Visualize Your Functions:** Use graphing tools to see the shape of your easing function and how it affects the animation.
- **Consider the Context:** The best easing function depends on the specific animation and the overall user experience.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your animations on different devices and browsers to ensure they perform as expected.

## Conclusion

Creating custom easing functions in Svelte empowers you to craft unique and engaging animations that enhance the user experience of your web applications. By understanding the principles of easing and experimenting with different formulas, you can unlock a world of creative possibilities and bring your designs to life. Remember to start simple, visualize your functions, and test thoroughly to create animations that are both visually appealing and performant. Happy animating!
