# Create Your Own CMD Text Adventure Game: A Step-by-Step Guide

Want to dive into game development but don't know where to start? You don't need fancy game engines! You can create a surprisingly engaging text adventure game using just the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) and batch scripting. This guide will walk you through the process, from planning your story to implementing interactive elements, making it perfect for beginners.

## Why a CMD Text Adventure?

- **Simplicity:** Batch scripting is a relatively straightforward language, making it easy to learn the basics of programming logic.
- **Accessibility:** Everyone with Windows has access to CMD. No need to download or install anything.
- **Focus on Story:** Text adventures are all about narrative. You can focus on crafting a compelling story and world without worrying about complex graphics.
- **Foundational Skills:** The logic you learn building a text adventure translates directly to more complex game development environments.

## Planning Your Game

Before you start writing code, it's crucial to plan your game. Consider the following:

- **Story:** What is the main plot? What are the key events?
- **Setting:** Where and when does the game take place? A detailed setting enhances immersion.
- **Characters:** Who are the key characters? Are they friendly or hostile?
- **Gameplay:** How does the player interact with the world? What actions can they perform? What items can they collect? What are the win and lose conditions?
- **Map:** Sketch out the different locations in your game and how they connect. This helps with game flow.

A simple example scenario:

- **Story:** You are a treasure hunter searching for a lost artifact in an ancient temple.
- **Setting:** A crumbling temple deep in the Amazon rainforest.
- **Characters:** A wise old guide (friendly), a rival treasure hunter (hostile).
- **Gameplay:** The player explores different rooms, solves puzzles, and fights enemies.
- **Map:** Entrance -> Hallway -> Puzzle Room -> Treasure Chamber -> Escape Route

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

All you need is a text editor (Notepad is fine, but something like Notepad++ or VS Code with batch file syntax highlighting is recommended) and the Windows Command Prompt.

1.  **Create a New Text File:** Open your text editor and create a new file.
2.  **Save the File:** Save the file with a `.bat` extension (e.g., `adventure.bat`). This tells Windows it's a batch script.
3.  **Open CMD:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
4.  **Navigate to Your File:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved your `.bat` file. For example, if you saved it in `C:\Games`, you would type `cd C:\Games`.

## Basic Batch Scripting Commands

Here are some basic CMD commands you'll use frequently:

- `echo`: Displays text on the screen. Example: `echo Hello, World!`
- `pause`: Pauses the script until the user presses a key. Example: `pause`
- `cls`: Clears the screen. Example: `cls`
- `goto`: Jumps to a specific label in the script. Labels are defined with a colon `:`. Example: `goto start`
- `set /p variable=prompt`: Prompts the user for input and stores it in a variable. Example: `set /p choice=What do you do? `
- `if`: Conditional statement. Example: `if "%choice%"=="open door" goto door_room`

## Building the Core Structure

Let's start with a basic game loop and introductory screen:

```plaintext
@echo off
title Text Adventure Game

:start
cls
echo Welcome to the Text Adventure!
echo.
echo You are standing at the entrance of an ancient temple.
echo To your left is a dark hallway. To your right is a locked door.
echo.
echo What do you do? (enter "left" or "right")
set /p choice=Your choice:

if "%choice%"=="left" goto hallway
if "%choice%"=="right" goto locked_door

echo Invalid choice. Please try again.
pause
goto start

:hallway
cls
echo You cautiously enter the dark hallway...
echo ... you see a flickering torch at the end.
pause
goto end  :: For now, let's just end the game after the hallway

:locked_door
cls
echo You try the locked door, but it won't budge.
pause
goto start

:end
echo Thanks for playing!
pause
exit
```

**Explanation:**

- `@echo off`: Suppresses the display of commands in the CMD window, making the output cleaner.
- `title Text Adventure Game`: Sets the title bar of the CMD window.
- `:start`: Defines a label named "start." This is where the game begins.
- `cls`: Clears the screen.
- `echo`: Displays text to the user. `echo.` displays an empty line for better readability.
- `set /p choice=Your choice: `: Prompts the user for input and stores it in the `choice` variable.
- `if "%choice%"=="left" goto hallway`: Checks if the user typed "left." If so, jumps to the `:hallway` label. Important: The `%` symbols are crucial for accessing the value of the variable.
- `goto end`: Jumps to the `:end` label, which ends the game. We use this for now to simplify the initial code.
- Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed, and the game returns to the `start` label.
- `pause`: Pauses the script so the user can read the output before the window closes.
- `exit`: Exits the script.

**To run the game:**

1.  Save the code as `adventure.bat`.
2.  Open CMD.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file (e.g., `cd C:\Games`).
4.  Type `adventure.bat` and press Enter.

## Expanding the Game World

Now, let's add more locations and interactions.

```plaintext
@echo off
title Text Adventure Game

:start
cls
echo Welcome to the Text Adventure!
echo.
echo You are standing at the entrance of an ancient temple.
echo To your left is a dark hallway. To your right is a locked door.
echo In front of you is a overgrown path.
echo.
echo What do you do? (left, right, forward)
set /p choice=Your choice:

if "%choice%"=="left" goto hallway
if "%choice%"=="right" goto locked_door
if "%choice%"=="forward" goto path

echo Invalid choice. Please try again.
pause
goto start

:hallway
cls
echo You cautiously enter the dark hallway...
echo ... you see a flickering torch at the end.
echo You can see a small inscription on the wall. Do you read it? (yes/no)
set /p choice=Read inscription?
if "%choice%"=="yes" goto inscription
if "%choice%"=="no" goto hallway_end
echo Invalid choice.
pause
goto hallway

:inscription
cls
echo The inscription reads: "The answer lies within the stars."
pause
goto hallway_end

:hallway_end
cls
echo You continue down the hallway and find yourself back at the entrance.
pause
goto start

:locked_door
cls
echo You try the locked door, but it won't budge.
echo Maybe you need a key...
pause
goto start

:path
cls
echo You walk down the overgrown path...
echo ... you stumble and fall into a deep pit!
echo GAME OVER!
pause
exit
```

**Changes:**

- Added a "forward" option leading to a `:path` location and a game over scenario.
- Expanded the `:hallway` location with an inscription interaction.
- Added an `inscription` label that tells a clue, potentially for a future puzzle.
- Kept the `:locked_door` as is, but added a hint about a key.

## Adding an Inventory System

A basic inventory system can add depth to your game. Let's implement one:

```plaintext
@echo off
title Text Adventure Game

set key=0  :: 0 = no key, 1 = has key

:start
cls
echo Welcome to the Text Adventure!
echo.
echo You are standing at the entrance of an ancient temple.
echo To your left is a dark hallway. To your right is a locked door.
echo In front of you is a overgrown path.
echo.
echo What do you do? (left, right, forward, check inventory)
set /p choice=Your choice:

if "%choice%"=="left" goto hallway
if "%choice%"=="right" goto locked_door
if "%choice%"=="forward" goto path
if "%choice%"=="check inventory" goto inventory

echo Invalid choice. Please try again.
pause
goto start

:hallway
cls
echo You cautiously enter the dark hallway...
echo ... you see a flickering torch at the end.
echo You can see a small inscription on the wall and a small shiny object on the floor.
echo What do you do? (read inscription, take object, back)
set /p choice=Your choice:
if "%choice%"=="read inscription" goto inscription
if "%choice%"=="take object" goto take_object
if "%choice%"=="back" goto start
echo Invalid choice.
pause
goto hallway

:inscription
cls
echo The inscription reads: "The answer lies within the stars."
pause
goto hallway

:take_object
cls
echo You pick up the shiny object. It's a small, ornate key!
set key=1
pause
goto hallway

:locked_door
cls
echo You are standing in front of the locked door.
if "%key%"=="1" (
  echo You insert the key into the lock and turn.  The door creaks open!
  goto treasure_room
) else (
  echo You try the locked door, but it won't budge. You need a key.
  pause
  goto start
)

:treasure_room
cls
echo You enter the treasure room!  Gold and jewels sparkle everywhere.
echo CONGRATULATIONS! You have found the treasure!
pause
exit

:path
cls
echo You walk down the overgrown path...
echo ... you stumble and fall into a deep pit!
echo GAME OVER!
pause
exit

:inventory
cls
echo Your Inventory:
if "%key%"=="1" (
    echo - Ornate Key
) else (
    echo - Empty
)
pause
goto start
```

**Explanation:**

- `set key=0`: Initializes a variable named `key` to `0`. This represents the player _not_ having the key.
- `if "%choice%"=="check inventory" goto inventory`: Adds an inventory option to the main menu.
- `:inventory`: Displays the contents of the player's inventory. It checks the value of the `key` variable.
- `:take_object`: Sets the `key` variable to `1` when the player picks up the key.
- `:locked_door`: Now checks if the player has the key (`if "%key%"=="1"`). If they do, the door opens, and they can access the `:treasure_room`.

## Tips for Creating a Compelling Text Adventure

- **Descriptive Language:** Use vivid language to paint a picture in the player's mind. Instead of "You are in a room," try "You find yourself in a vast chamber, the air thick with the scent of mildew and forgotten secrets. Torches flicker, casting long, dancing shadows across the stone walls."
- **Engaging Puzzles:** Make sure puzzles are challenging but solvable. Provide clues throughout the game. Consider using riddles, logic puzzles, or object manipulation.
- **Branching Storylines:** Offer players meaningful choices that affect the outcome of the game.
- **Humor:** A little humor can go a long way in making your game more enjoyable.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your game to find bugs and ensure the story flows logically. Ask friends to playtest and provide feedback.
- **Comments:** Add comments to your code (using `REM` at the beginning of the line) to explain what each section does. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Advanced Techniques

- **Random Events:** Use the `%random%` variable to introduce random events, like finding a useful item or encountering a monster.
- **Combat Systems:** Implement a simple combat system using variables to track health and damage.
- **Timers:** Use the `timeout` command to introduce timed events.
- **External Files:** For larger games, consider storing text descriptions in external files and reading them into variables. This makes the main `.bat` file cleaner.

## Conclusion

Creating a text adventure game in CMD is a fun and rewarding project that teaches fundamental programming concepts. While limited in graphics, the focus on storytelling and interaction allows for a unique and engaging gaming experience. Start with a simple idea, gradually expand your game world, and don't be afraid to experiment! Good luck, and happy adventuring!
