# Comprehensive Guide to Error Tracking in Web2py with Sentry and Rollbar

Web2py, a full-stack Python web framework, offers a rapid development environment for creating robust web applications. However, even the most well-written applications can encounter errors. Effective error tracking is crucial for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving these issues promptly, ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing potential data loss or security vulnerabilities. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to integrate Sentry and Rollbar, two popular error tracking services, into your Web2py projects.

## Why Use Error Tracking?

Without proper error tracking, you're essentially flying blind. You might only become aware of problems when users report them, or worse, when critical failures occur. A dedicated error tracking solution provides numerous benefits:

- **Real-time Error Monitoring:** Receive immediate notifications when errors occur in your application.
- **Detailed Error Context:** Access comprehensive information about each error, including stack traces, request parameters, user context, and environment details. This greatly simplifies debugging.
- **Centralized Error Management:** Consolidate error reports from all parts of your application into a single platform.
- **Improved Application Stability:** Proactively identify and fix issues before they impact users.
- **Performance Monitoring (with some plans):** Some services offer insights into your application's performance, helping you identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

## Sentry vs. Rollbar: A Quick Comparison

Both Sentry and Rollbar are excellent error tracking platforms. Here's a brief comparison:

| Feature        | Sentry                                                                  | Rollbar                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pricing        | Open source option available; tiered pricing based on events.           | Tiered pricing based on events.                                          |
| Data Privacy   | You can self-host Sentry for maximum data privacy.                      | Hosted solution; relies on their infrastructure.                         |
| Features       | Comprehensive error tracking, performance monitoring, release tracking. | Excellent error grouping, stack trace analysis, and collaboration tools. |
| Learning Curve | Can be slightly steeper initially due to the extensive feature set.     | Generally considered easier to set up and use.                           |
| Event Grouping | Excellent, but requires careful configuration for optimal grouping.     | Known for its superior event grouping and de-duplication capabilities.   |
| Web2py Support | Requires a bit more manual integration.                                 | Offers reasonably good Python support, which extends to Web2py usage.    |

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your specific needs and preferences. This guide will cover how to integrate both.

## Integrating Sentry with Web2py

### Step 1: Install the Sentry SDK

First, install the Sentry Python SDK using `pip`:

```plaintext
pip install sentry-sdk
```

### Step 2: Configure Sentry in your Web2py Application

The ideal place to initialize Sentry is in your `models/db.py` file (or another module that is guaranteed to be loaded on application startup).

```plaintext
# models/db.py
import os
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.web2py import Web2pyIntegration

dsn = os.environ.get('SENTRY_DSN')  # Store your DSN in an environment variable

if dsn:
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn=dsn,
        integrations=[Web2pyIntegration()],
        environment=os.environ.get('SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT', 'development'), # Optionally set the environment
        release=os.environ.get('SENTRY_RELEASE'),  # Optionally set the release version
        traces_sample_rate=0.2, # Sample rate for transactions - Adjust as needed
        # Add any other relevant configuration options here
    )

    # Example Usage:
    try:
        1 / 0  # Force an exception
    except Exception as e:
        sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import sentry_sdk`:** Imports the Sentry SDK.
- **`from sentry_sdk.integrations.web2py import Web2pyIntegration`:** Imports the Web2py integration for automatic context collection.
- **`dsn = os.environ.get('SENTRY_DSN')`:** Retrieves your Sentry DSN (Data Source Name) from an environment variable. **Never hardcode your DSN in your code!** Store it securely. You'll find the DSN in your Sentry project settings.
- **`sentry_sdk.init(...)`:** Initializes the Sentry SDK with your DSN.
  - **`integrations=[Web2pyIntegration()]`:** This is crucial. It enables Web2py-specific context to be included in error reports (request data, user information, etc.).
  - **`environment`:** (Optional) Set the environment (e.g., 'development', 'staging', 'production'). This helps you filter errors in Sentry.
  - **`release`:** (Optional) Set the application release version. This allows you to track errors specific to certain releases.
  - **`traces_sample_rate`:** (Optional) Controls the percentage of transactions that are captured for performance monitoring. Adjust as needed for your budget and monitoring requirements.
- **`sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)`:** Manually captures an exception. This is shown as an example; you don't usually need to call this directly in most Web2py code due to the automatic exception handling provided by the `Web2pyIntegration`.

### Step 3: Setting the `SENTRY_DSN` Environment Variable

Set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable on your server. The exact method depends on your hosting environment. Here are a few examples:

- **Linux/macOS:**

  ```plaintext
  export SENTRY_DSN="YOUR_SENTRY_DSN"
  ```

  Add this line to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or other shell configuration file for persistent setting.

- **Windows:**

  Use the `setx` command:

  ```
  setx SENTRY_DSN "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN" /M
  ```

  (The `/M` flag sets the variable at the machine level, requiring administrator privileges.)

- **Hosting Platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk):** Use the platform's configuration tools to set the environment variable. Refer to your hosting provider's documentation for details.

### Step 4: Testing the Integration

Introduce an error in your code (e.g., division by zero) to trigger an exception. Then, visit the corresponding URL in your application. Check your Sentry dashboard; you should see the error reported.

```plaintext
# controller/default.py
def index():
    try:
        result = 10 / 0
        return dict(message="Result: %s" % result)
    except Exception as e:
        sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e) # Manually capture in the controller, although Web2pyIntegration should catch this automatically
        return dict(message="An error occurred.")
```

### Step 5: Capturing User Context

To get even more valuable information, capture the user's context (ID, email, etc.) and send it to Sentry. You can do this in your `models/db.py` or in a controller function that handles user authentication.

```plaintext
# models/db.py (or a controller function after user login)
import sentry_sdk

def set_sentry_user(user):
    """Sets the Sentry user context based on the logged-in user."""
    if user:
        sentry_sdk.set_user({
            "id": user.id,  # Assuming 'user.id' exists
            "email": user.email, # Assuming 'user.email' exists
            "username": user.username if hasattr(user, 'username') else None  # Example: user object has 'username' attribute
        })
    else:
        sentry_sdk.set_user(None)  # Clear the user context when the user logs out

# Example Usage:
# After successful login (e.g., in a controller)
# session.auth.user will be populated by the auth.login form in web2py's auth functionality
if auth.user:
    set_sentry_user(auth.user)

# Clear the user context on logout:
# After logout is successful (e.g., in a controller)
set_sentry_user(None)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`sentry_sdk.set_user(...)`:** Sets the user context in Sentry.
- Provide a dictionary with user details such as `id`, `email`, and `username`. Adjust the keys to match the attributes of your `user` object.
- Call `set_sentry_user(auth.user)` after a successful login (using Web2py's built-in authentication or a custom authentication method).
- Call `set_sentry_user(None)` when the user logs out.

### Step 6: Capturing Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are logs of events that occurred _before_ an error, providing valuable context for debugging. You can manually add breadcrumbs to your code to track important actions.

```plaintext
import sentry_sdk

def my_function():
    sentry_sdk.add_breadcrumb(
        category="user_action",
        message="User clicked the 'Submit' button.",
        level="info"
    )
    # ... your code ...
    try:
        # ... some operation ...
    except Exception as e:
        sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)

```

**Explanation:**

- **`sentry_sdk.add_breadcrumb(...)`:** Adds a breadcrumb to the current Sentry scope.
- **`category`:** Categorize the breadcrumb (e.g., "user_action", "database", "network").
- **`message`:** A descriptive message about the event.
- **`level`:** The severity level of the event ("info", "warning", "error", "debug").

## Integrating Rollbar with Web2py

### Step 1: Install the Rollbar SDK

Install the Rollbar Python SDK using `pip`:

```plaintext
pip install rollbar
```

### Step 2: Configure Rollbar in your Web2py Application

Similar to Sentry, initialize Rollbar in your `models/db.py` file (or another module that is guaranteed to be loaded on application startup).

```plaintext
# models/db.py
import os
import rollbar

ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN = os.environ.get('ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN') # Retrieve from environment variable

if ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN:
    rollbar.init(
        ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
        environment=os.environ.get('ROLLBAR_ENVIRONMENT', 'development'),  # Optional environment
        root=os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), # Automatically determine the project root
        allow_logging_basic_config=False, #Prevent conflict with web2py's logging configuration
    )

    # Example Usage: (not strictly necessary as Rollbar can automatically catch exceptions)
    try:
        1 / 0 # Force an exception
    except Exception as e:
        rollbar.report_exc_info()
```

**Explanation:**

- **`import rollbar`:** Imports the Rollbar SDK.
- **`ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN = os.environ.get('ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN')`:** Retrieves your Rollbar access token from an environment variable.
- **`rollbar.init(...)`:** Initializes the Rollbar SDK with your access token.
  - **`environment`:** (Optional) Set the environment (e.g., 'development', 'staging', 'production').
  - **`root`:** (Optional) Sets the project root directory. Helpful for Rollbar to correctly display file paths.
  - **`allow_logging_basic_config=False`:** This is crucial to prevent Rollbar from interfering with Web2py's existing logging configuration. If omitted, you might see unexpected behavior in your Web2py logs.
- **`rollbar.report_exc_info()`:** Reports the current exception to Rollbar. Like Sentry, Rollbar will often catch exceptions automatically, so this manual reporting may not always be required.

### Step 3: Setting the `ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` Environment Variable

Set the `ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable using the same methods described for `SENTRY_DSN`.

### Step 4: Testing the Integration

Introduce an error in your code to trigger an exception and check your Rollbar dashboard.

```plaintext
# controller/default.py
def index():
    try:
        result = 10 / 0
        return dict(message="Result: %s" % result)
    except Exception as e:
        rollbar.report_exc_info()  #Manually capture, but Rollbar should catch automatically
        return dict(message="An error occurred.")
```

### Step 5: Capturing User Context

Rollbar uses a slightly different method for capturing user context:

```plaintext
# models/db.py (or a controller function after user login)
import rollbar

def set_rollbar_user(user):
    """Sets the Rollbar user context based on the logged-in user."""
    if user:
        rollbar.report_message("User logged in", level="info", extra_data={
            'id': user.id,  # Assuming 'user.id' exists
            'email': user.email,  # Assuming 'user.email' exists
            'username': user.username if hasattr(user, 'username') else None  # Example: user object has 'username' attribute
        })
    else:
       rollbar.report_message("User logged out", level="info") #Report the user logging out too.

# Example Usage:
# After successful login (e.g., in a controller)
if auth.user:
    set_rollbar_user(auth.user)

# Clear the user context on logout:
# After logout is successful (e.g., in a controller)
set_rollbar_user(None)
```

**Explanation:**

- Instead of a dedicated `set_user` function, Rollbar uses `report_message` with `extra_data` to attach user information to an event.
- The `level="info"` indicates that this is an informational message.

### Step 6: Capturing Breadcrumbs

Rollbar refers to breadcrumbs as "custom data." You can add custom data to your error reports.

```plaintext
import rollbar

def my_function():
    rollbar.report_message(
        "User clicked the 'Submit' button.",
        level="info",
        extra_data={"category": "user_action"}
    )
    # ... your code ...
    try:
        # ... some operation ...
    except Exception as e:
        rollbar.report_exc_info(extra_data={"some_key": "some_value"})

```

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

- **Security:** Protect your DSN/access token! Never commit it to your code repository. Use environment variables and store them securely.
- **Data Privacy:** Be mindful of the data you send to error tracking services. Avoid sending sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. Configure Sentry/Rollbar to filter out sensitive data if necessary.
- **Error Grouping:** Sentry and Rollbar use algorithms to group similar errors. Review these groupings regularly to ensure they are accurate. You may need to adjust your code or configure the services to improve grouping.
- **Rate Limiting:** Be aware of the rate limits of your chosen error tracking service. Avoid sending excessive numbers of errors, especially in development environments. You can use sampling to reduce the number of events sent to Sentry/Rollbar.
- **Release Tracking:** Use release tracking to identify errors specific to certain versions of your application. This simplifies debugging after deployments.
- **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify you of critical errors. This allows you to respond quickly to issues.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your error tracking integration to ensure it is working correctly. Simulate different types of errors and verify that they are reported to Sentry/Rollbar.
- **Web2py's Built-in Logger:** Web2py has a built-in logger that you can use to log messages to a file. While it's not a replacement for dedicated error tracking, it can be useful for debugging and monitoring your application. You can access the logger using `logger = logging.getLogger("web2py.app.YOUR_APP_NAME")`.

## Conclusion

Integrating Sentry or Rollbar into your Web2py application is a valuable investment that will save you time and effort in the long run. By proactively monitoring errors and capturing detailed context, you can improve the stability and reliability of your application, providing a better experience for your users. Remember to follow the best practices outlined in this guide to ensure a secure and effective implementation. Choose the error tracking service that best fits your needs and start tracking those bugs! Remember to set up those environment variables correctly. Happy debugging!
