# Event-Driven Architecture in NestJS with EventEmitter2: A Comprehensive Guide

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a powerful architectural pattern that enables building loosely coupled, scalable, and highly responsive applications. In this model, components communicate by emitting and listening to events, allowing for asynchronous processing and increased resilience. NestJS, with its modular design and support for various libraries, provides a robust platform for implementing EDA. This article will explore how to leverage `EventEmitter2` within NestJS to build a solid event-driven system.

## What is Event-Driven Architecture?

At its core, event-driven architecture revolves around the concept of _events_. An event represents a significant state change or occurrence in a system. Components within the system react to these events, performing actions based on the information contained within them. This paradigm offers several advantages:

- **Loose Coupling:** Components don't need to know about each other directly. They only need to know about the events they emit or consume.
- **Scalability:** Services can be added or removed without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Events can be processed asynchronously, improving performance and responsiveness.
- **Resilience:** If one service fails, other services can continue to operate, as they are not directly dependent on the failed service.

## Introducing EventEmitter2

`EventEmitter2` is a popular Node.js library that extends the standard `EventEmitter` with several useful features, including:

- **Wildcard Events:** Subscribe to multiple events with a single pattern (e.g., `user.*`).
- **Namespaces:** Organize events into logical groups.
- **Prioritized Listeners:** Control the order in which listeners are executed.
- **Asynchronous Execution:** Handle events asynchronously.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling for event listeners.

NestJS provides seamless integration with `EventEmitter2` through its `@nestjs/event-emitter` module, making it a natural choice for building EDAs.

## Setting Up Your NestJS Project

First, let's create a new NestJS project using the Nest CLI:

```plaintext
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
nest new nestjs-event-emitter-example
cd nestjs-event-emitter-example
```

Next, install the `@nestjs/event-emitter` package:

```plaintext
npm install --save @nestjs/event-emitter
```

And finally, import the `EventEmitterModule` in your `AppModule`:

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { EventEmitterModule } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'

@Module({
  imports: [
    EventEmitterModule.forRoot(), // Or configure options here
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

`EventEmitterModule.forRoot()` configures the `EventEmitter2` instance for your application. You can pass configuration options to customize its behavior, such as:

```plaintext
EventEmitterModule.forRoot({
  wildcard: true, // Enable wildcard listeners
  delimiter: '.', // Set the delimiter for namespaces
  newListener: true, // Enable newListener event
  removeListener: true, // Enable removeListener event
  maxListeners: 10, // Set max listeners
})
```

## Creating and Emitting Events

Let's create a simple example where a `UserCreatedEvent` is emitted when a new user is created. First, define the event payload:

```plaintext
// src/events/user-created.event.ts
export class UserCreatedEvent {
  constructor(
    public readonly userId: string,
    public readonly email: string
  ) {}
}
```

Now, create a service that emits this event when a new user is created:

```plaintext
// src/user/user.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { EventEmitter2 } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '../events/user-created.event'

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private readonly eventEmitter: EventEmitter2) {}

  async createUser(email: string): Promise<string> {
    // Simulate user creation in database
    const userId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)

    // Emit the UserCreatedEvent
    this.eventEmitter.emit('user.created', new UserCreatedEvent(userId, email))

    return userId
  }
}
```

In this example, we inject `EventEmitter2` into the `UserService` and use its `emit` method to publish the `user.created` event, passing the `UserCreatedEvent` payload.

Finally, create a controller to trigger the user creation:

```plaintext
// src/user/user.controller.ts
import { Controller, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common'
import { UserService } from './user.service'

@Controller('users')
export class UserController {
  constructor(private readonly userService: UserService) {}

  @Post()
  async createUser(@Body() body: { email: string }): Promise<string> {
    return this.userService.createUser(body.email)
  }
}
```

You'll also need to create a `UserModule` to import the `UserService` and `UserController`:

```plaintext
// src/user/user.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { UserService } from './user.service'
import { UserController } from './user.controller'

@Module({
  providers: [UserService],
  controllers: [UserController],
})
export class UserModule {}
```

And import the `UserModule` into the `AppModule`:

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { EventEmitterModule } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'
import { UserModule } from './user/user.module'

@Module({
  imports: [EventEmitterModule.forRoot(), UserModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, you can send a POST request to `/users` with a JSON body containing the email:

```plaintext
{
  "email": "test@example.com"
}
```

This will trigger the `createUser` method in the `UserService`, which will emit the `user.created` event.

## Subscribing to Events

Now, let's create a listener that subscribes to the `user.created` event and performs some action, such as sending a welcome email.

```plaintext
// src/listeners/user-created.listener.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { OnEvent } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '../events/user-created.event'

@Injectable()
export class UserCreatedListener {
  @OnEvent('user.created')
  handleUserCreatedEvent(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
    // Logic to send a welcome email
    console.log(`Sending welcome email to ${event.email} for user ${event.userId}`)
    // In a real application, you'd use a dedicated email service
  }
}
```

The `@OnEvent('user.created')` decorator tells NestJS to execute the `handleUserCreatedEvent` method whenever the `user.created` event is emitted. The `event` parameter will contain the payload of the event (in this case, the `UserCreatedEvent` instance).

Register the `UserCreatedListener` in a module (e.g., `AppModule` or a dedicated `ListenerModule`):

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { EventEmitterModule } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'
import { UserModule } from './user/user.module'
import { UserCreatedListener } from './listeners/user-created.listener'

@Module({
  imports: [EventEmitterModule.forRoot(), UserModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService, UserCreatedListener],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, when you create a user via the API, you'll see the console log message indicating that the welcome email is being sent.

## Wildcard Events

`EventEmitter2` supports wildcard events, allowing you to subscribe to multiple events with a single listener. For example, you could subscribe to all events related to users using the `user.*` pattern:

```plaintext
// src/listeners/user.listener.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { OnEvent } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'

@Injectable()
export class UserListener {
  @OnEvent('user.*')
  handleUserEvent(payload: any, eventName: string) {
    console.log(`User event ${eventName} triggered with payload:`, payload)
  }
}
```

In this example, the `handleUserEvent` method will be executed for any event that starts with `user.`, such as `user.created`, `user.updated`, or `user.deleted`. The `eventName` parameter will contain the full event name, and the `payload` parameter will contain the event payload.

Remember to register the `UserListener` in your module as well.

## Namespaces

Namespaces help organize events into logical groups. You can use namespaces to prevent event name collisions and improve code readability. You can define namespaces using the delimiter you configured in `EventEmitterModule.forRoot()` (default is `.`)

In our `UserCreatedEvent` example, we are already using namespaces: `user.created`. This means all events related to users will start with the `user` namespace.

## Asynchronous Event Handling

For long-running or potentially blocking operations, it's essential to handle events asynchronously to avoid impacting the performance of the main application thread. You can achieve this by using `async` functions:

```plaintext
// src/listeners/user-created.listener.ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'
import { OnEvent } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '../events/user-created.event'

@Injectable()
export class UserCreatedListener {
  @OnEvent('user.created')
  async handleUserCreatedEvent(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
    // Simulate a long-running operation
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))

    console.log(`Sending welcome email to ${event.email} for user ${event.userId}`)
    // In a real application, you'd use a dedicated email service
  }
}
```

By making the `handleUserCreatedEvent` method `async`, NestJS will automatically handle the event asynchronously, preventing it from blocking the main thread.

## Error Handling

Handling errors in event listeners is crucial for maintaining the stability of your application. You can use `try...catch` blocks to catch errors that occur during event processing:

```plaintext
// src/listeners/user-created.listener.ts
import { Injectable, Logger } from '@nestjs/common'
import { OnEvent } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '../events/user-created.event'

@Injectable()
export class UserCreatedListener {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(UserCreatedListener.name)
  @OnEvent('user.created')
  async handleUserCreatedEvent(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
    try {
      // Logic to send a welcome email
      console.log(`Sending welcome email to ${event.email} for user ${event.userId}`)

      if (Math.random() < 0.2) {
        throw new Error('Failed to send welcome email')
      }

      // Simulate a long-running operation
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error(
        `Error sending welcome email to ${event.email}: ${error.message}`,
        error.stack
      )
      // Optionally, re-emit the error event for global error handling
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, if an error occurs while sending the welcome email, the `catch` block will log the error and prevent the application from crashing. You can also re-emit the error event to a central error handling component.

## Prioritized Listeners

You can control the order in which listeners are executed by assigning priorities to them. Listeners with higher priorities will be executed before listeners with lower priorities.

NestJS doesn't have built-in support for prioritized listeners via the `@OnEvent` decorator directly. However, you can achieve this by manually subscribing to the event using the `EventEmitter2` service and specifying the priority.

First, you'll need to remove the `@OnEvent` decorator and instead subscribe programmatically in the constructor of your listener class:

```plaintext
// src/listeners/user-created-listener-priority.ts
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common'
import { EventEmitter2 } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '../events/user-created.event'

@Injectable()
export class UserCreatedListenerPriority implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(private readonly eventEmitter: EventEmitter2) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    this.eventEmitter.on(
      'user.created',
      (event: UserCreatedEvent) => {
        this.handleUserCreatedEvent(event)
      },
      { priority: 10 }
    ) // Higher priority
  }

  handleUserCreatedEvent(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
    console.log(`[Priority 10] Sending welcome email to ${event.email} for user ${event.userId}`)
  }
}
```

```plaintext
// src/listeners/user-created-listener-default.ts
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common'
import { EventEmitter2 } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { UserCreatedEvent } from '../events/user-created.event'

@Injectable()
export class UserCreatedListenerDefault implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(private readonly eventEmitter: EventEmitter2) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    this.eventEmitter.on('user.created', (event: UserCreatedEvent) => {
      this.handleUserCreatedEvent(event)
    }) // Default priority
  }

  handleUserCreatedEvent(event: UserCreatedEvent) {
    console.log(
      `[Default Priority] Sending welcome email to ${event.email} for user ${event.userId}`
    )
  }
}
```

In `UserCreatedListenerPriority`, the listener is registered with `priority: 10`, making it higher priority than the default. We use `OnModuleInit` lifecycle hook to subscribe after the module has been initialized and dependencies injected. `UserCreatedListenerDefault` uses the default priority (which is lower).

Register both listeners in your module:

```plaintext
// app.module.ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { EventEmitterModule } from '@nestjs/event-emitter'
import { AppController } from './app.controller'
import { AppService } from './app.service'
import { UserModule } from './user/user.module'
import { UserCreatedListenerPriority } from './listeners/user-created-listener-priority'
import { UserCreatedListenerDefault } from './listeners/user-created-listener-default'

@Module({
  imports: [EventEmitterModule.forRoot(), UserModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService, UserCreatedListenerPriority, UserCreatedListenerDefault],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, when the `user.created` event is emitted, `UserCreatedListenerPriority` will be executed before `UserCreatedListenerDefault`.

## Using Event Emitters for Microservices Communication

Event-driven architecture is particularly well-suited for microservices communication. Instead of direct service-to-service calls, services can communicate by emitting events to a message broker (like RabbitMQ or Kafka), and other services can subscribe to those events.

While `EventEmitter2` is primarily designed for in-process event handling, you can combine it with a message broker client to build an event-driven microservices architecture.

Here's a conceptual outline:

1.  **Service A (Event Producer):** Emits an event using `EventEmitter2`. Inside the event handler, it serializes the event data and publishes it to the message broker.
2.  **Message Broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka):** Receives the event from Service A and routes it to the appropriate queues/topics based on the event type.
3.  **Service B (Event Consumer):** Subscribes to the relevant queue/topic in the message broker. When it receives an event, it deserializes the data and emits a corresponding event using its own `EventEmitter2` instance. Other components within Service B can then listen for this internal event.

While a detailed implementation with a message broker is beyond the scope of this article, this provides a general idea of how `EventEmitter2` can be integrated with microservices. Libraries like `amqplib` (for RabbitMQ) or `kafkajs` (for Kafka) can be used to connect to the message broker. You would create a separate module in your NestJS application to handle the message broker communication.

## Conclusion

Event-driven architecture offers a powerful approach to building scalable, resilient, and loosely coupled applications. NestJS, coupled with `EventEmitter2`, provides a straightforward and efficient way to implement EDA within your projects. By understanding the concepts and techniques outlined in this guide, you can effectively leverage event-driven principles to create robust and maintainable applications. Remember to choose the right event-driven pattern for your use case (e.g., in-process vs. microservices), handle errors gracefully, and consider performance implications when dealing with large volumes of events.
