# Accept Payments in React Native with Stripe: A Comprehensive Guide to @stripe/stripe-react-native

Integrating payments into your React Native application is crucial for many businesses.  Stripe offers a robust and secure solution, and `@stripe/stripe-react-native` is the official Stripe SDK for React Native developers. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of how to integrate Stripe payments into your React Native apps, covering everything from initial setup to accepting various payment methods.

## Why Use @stripe/stripe-react-native?

`@stripe/stripe-react-native` offers several advantages:

*   **Official Support:**  Backed by Stripe, ensuring up-to-date features and security.
*   **Native Performance:** Uses native Stripe SDKs for iOS and Android, delivering a seamless user experience.
*   **Secure Tokenization:**  Handles sensitive payment data securely, reducing your PCI compliance scope.
*   **Payment Method Support:** Supports a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more.
*   **Easy Integration:**  Provides React Native components and hooks for easy integration into your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   **A Stripe Account:**  Sign up for a free Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/).
*   **React Native Development Environment:**  A working React Native development environment with Node.js, npm/yarn/pnpm, and Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android) installed.
*   **Basic React Native Knowledge:**  Familiarity with React Native components, state management, and asynchronous operations.
*   **Expo or React Native CLI:** The library works with both Expo and React Native CLI projects.  If you are using Expo, you will need to use a development build or eject to a bare workflow to access the native functionality.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Install the Package:**

    ```bash
    npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native
    # or
    yarn add @stripe/stripe-react-native
    # or
    pnpm add @stripe/stripe-react-native
    ```

2.  **Configure Native Projects (iOS):**

    *   **Install Pods:**  Navigate to your `ios` directory and run:

        ```bash
        cd ios
        pod install
        ```

    *   **Add Stripe Publishable Key to `Info.plist`:**  Open `ios/[YourAppName]/Info.plist` and add the following key:

        ```xml
        <key>StripePublishableKey</key>
        <string>YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY</string>
        ```

        Replace `YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your actual Stripe publishable key (starts with `pk_live_` or `pk_test_`).

    *   **Configure URL Scheme:**  If you're using 3D Secure authentication (recommended), add a URL scheme to handle redirects. Open `ios/[YourAppName]/Info.plist` and add the following:

        ```xml
        <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
        <array>
            <dict>
                <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
                <array>
                    <string>YOUR_APP_SCHEME</string>
                </array>
                <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
                <string>YOUR_APP_BUNDLE_ID</string>
            </dict>
        </array>
        ```

        Replace `YOUR_APP_SCHEME` with a unique URL scheme (e.g., `myapp`).  Replace `YOUR_APP_BUNDLE_ID` with your application's bundle identifier.
        Make sure that this scheme is available and not used by any other app installed on the device.

3.  **Configure Native Projects (Android):**

    *   **Add Stripe Publishable Key to `AndroidManifest.xml`:** Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following `<meta-data>` tag inside the `<application>` tag:

        ```xml
        <application>
            <meta-data
                android:name="com.stripe.android.publishable_key"
                android:value="YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY" />
            ...
        </application>
        ```

        Replace `YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your actual Stripe publishable key.

    *   **Configure URL Scheme:** Similar to iOS, configure a URL scheme for 3D Secure.  Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following `<intent-filter>` inside the `<activity>` tag for your main activity:

        ```xml
        <activity ...>
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data android:scheme="YOUR_APP_SCHEME" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        ```

        Replace `YOUR_APP_SCHEME` with the same URL scheme you used in iOS (e.g., `myapp`).

    *   **Add internet permission:** Add the following permission in  `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` within the manifest tag.

        ```xml
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
        ```

4. **Initialize the Stripe Provider:**

   Wrap your root component with the `StripeProvider` and pass your publishable key:

   ```jsx
   import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

   const App = () => {
     return (
       <StripeProvider
         publishableKey="YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
         urlScheme="YOUR_APP_SCHEME" // required for 3D Secure and Apple Pay
         merchantIdentifier="YOUR_APPLE_PAY_MERCHANT_ID" // required for Apple Pay
       >
         {/* Your app components */}
       </StripeProvider>
     );
   };

   export default App;
   ```

   * Replace `YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your Stripe publishable key.
   * Replace `YOUR_APP_SCHEME` with the URL scheme you defined in your iOS and Android configurations. This is crucial for handling 3D Secure redirects.
   * Replace `YOUR_APPLE_PAY_MERCHANT_ID` with your Apple Pay merchant identifier. This is only required if you plan to implement Apple Pay. You obtain this identifier through your Apple Developer account.

## Accepting Card Payments

Here's how to accept card payments using `@stripe/stripe-react-native`:

1.  **Create a Payment Intent on Your Server:**  Before processing a payment, you need to create a Payment Intent on your server using the Stripe API. This Payment Intent represents the customer's intent to pay and guides the payment flow.

    ```javascript
    // Example Node.js server code (using stripe package)
    const stripe = require('stripe')('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json());

    app.post('/create-payment-intent', async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const { amount, currency } = req.body;
        const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
          amount: amount,
          currency: currency,
          automatic_payment_methods: {
            enabled: true,
          },
        });

        res.json({ clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
      }
    });

    app.listen(4242, () => console.log('Node server listening on port 4242!'));
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` with your Stripe secret key (starts with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`).

2.  **Use `useStripe` Hook:** In your React Native component, use the `useStripe` hook to access Stripe methods:

    ```jsx
    import { useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';
    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { Button, View, Alert } from 'react-native';

    const PaymentScreen = () => {
      const { initPaymentSheet, presentPaymentSheet } = useStripe();
      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

      const initializePaymentSheet = async () => {
        setLoading(true);
        // 1. Fetch the Payment Intent client secret from your server
        const response = await fetch('http://localhost:4242/create-payment-intent', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            amount: 1099, // Amount in cents
            currency: 'usd',
          }),
        });
        const { clientSecret } = await response.json();

        // 2. Initialize the Payment Sheet with the client secret
        const { error } = await initPaymentSheet({
          paymentIntentClientSecret: clientSecret,
        });
        if (error) {
          console.log(error);
          Alert.alert(`Something went wrong`, error.message);
        }
        setLoading(false);
      };


      const openPaymentSheet = async () => {
        setLoading(true);
        const { error } = await presentPaymentSheet();

        if (error) {
          Alert.alert(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        } else {
          Alert.alert(`Success`, `Your payment was processed successfully!`);
        }
        setLoading(false);
      };

      return (
        <View>
          <Button
            title="Initialize Payment Sheet"
            onPress={initializePaymentSheet}
            disabled={loading}
          />
          <Button
            title="Pay"
            onPress={openPaymentSheet}
            disabled={loading}
          />
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default PaymentScreen;
    ```

    This example demonstrates the basic flow:

    *   Fetch the `clientSecret` from your server endpoint (`/create-payment-intent`).
    *   Call `initPaymentSheet` to initialize the Payment Sheet with the `clientSecret`.
    *   Call `presentPaymentSheet` to present the Payment Sheet to the user.
    *   Handle any errors or success responses.

## Accepting Apple Pay

To accept Apple Pay:

1.  **Configure Apple Pay in Stripe:**  Follow Stripe's documentation to configure Apple Pay in your Stripe dashboard. This involves verifying your domain and registering your merchant identifier.

2.  **Enable Apple Pay in your app.**
    Go to the Xcode project, select the target and go to Signing & Capabilities. Click the '+ Capability' and add 'Apple Pay' in the search bar. Select Apple Pay from the suggestions and add the Merchant IDs that are configured in the Stripe dashboard.

3.  **Use the `presentApplePay` function:**

    ```jsx
    import { useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';
    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { Button, View, Alert, Platform } from 'react-native';

    const ApplePayButton = () => {
      const { presentApplePay, isApplePaySupported } = useStripe();
      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

      const handleApplePay = async () => {
        setLoading(true);

        const { error } = await presentApplePay({
          cartItems: [{ label: 'My product', amount: '10.99' }],
          countryCode: 'US',
          currencyCode: 'USD',
        });

        if (error) {
          Alert.alert(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        } else {
          Alert.alert(`Success`, `Your payment was processed successfully!`);
        }

        setLoading(false);
      };

      // Check if Apple Pay is available on the device
      const [applePayAvailable, setApplePayAvailable] = useState(false);

      useEffect(() => {
        const checkApplePayAvailability = async () => {
          const isSupported = await isApplePaySupported();
          setApplePayAvailable(isSupported);
        };

        if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
          checkApplePayAvailability();
        }
      }, [isApplePaySupported]);

      return (
        <View>
          {Platform.OS === 'ios' && applePayAvailable && (
            <Button
              title="Pay with Apple Pay"
              onPress={handleApplePay}
              disabled={loading}
            />
          )}
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default ApplePayButton;
    ```

    *  This example assumes the merchant identifier is set in StripeProvider, as specified in the initial setup.  You'll also need to call the `isApplePaySupported` to ensure the device supports apple pay.

## Accepting Google Pay

To accept Google Pay:

1.  **Configure Google Pay in Stripe:** Follow Stripe's documentation to configure Google Pay in your Stripe dashboard.

2.  **Initialize Google Pay:** You'll need to initialize Google Pay with the appropriate parameters:

    ```jsx
    import { useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';
    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { Button, View, Alert, Platform } from 'react-native';

    const GooglePayButton = () => {
      const { presentGooglePay, isGooglePaySupported } = useStripe();
      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

      const handleGooglePay = async () => {
        setLoading(true);

        const { error } = await presentGooglePay({
          amount: '10.99',
          currencyCode: 'USD',
          countryCode: 'US',
        });

        if (error) {
          Alert.alert(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        } else {
          Alert.alert(`Success`, `Your payment was processed successfully!`);
        }

        setLoading(false);
      };

      const [googlePayAvailable, setGooglePayAvailable] = useState(false);

      useEffect(() => {
        const checkGooglePayAvailability = async () => {
          const isSupported = await isGooglePaySupported({
            testEnv: true, // Set to true for testing, false for production
          });
          setGooglePayAvailable(isSupported);
        };

        if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
          checkGooglePayAvailability();
        }
      }, [isGooglePaySupported]);

      return (
        <View>
          {Platform.OS === 'android' && googlePayAvailable && (
            <Button
              title="Pay with Google Pay"
              onPress={handleGooglePay}
              disabled={loading}
            />
          )}
        </View>
      );
    };

    export default GooglePayButton;
    ```

## Handling 3D Secure

3D Secure (3DS) adds an extra layer of authentication to card payments, reducing fraud and improving security. `@stripe/stripe-react-native` handles 3DS automatically through the Payment Sheet.  Ensure you have correctly configured the URL scheme in your iOS and Android project settings as described earlier. This is essential for handling the redirect back to your app after the 3DS authentication flow.

## Best Practices and Security Considerations

*   **Server-Side Logic:**  Always create Payment Intents and handle payment confirmations on your server to ensure security and prevent manipulation.
*   **Use HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS for all communication between your app and your server to protect sensitive data.
*   **PCI Compliance:**  Understand your PCI compliance obligations.  Using Stripe's SDKs and Payment Sheet can significantly reduce your scope, but you still need to follow best practices for data security.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle payment failures and provide informative messages to users.
*   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your integration with Stripe's test mode before going live. Use test card numbers and other test credentials provided by Stripe.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Missing Stripe Publishable Key" Error:**  Double-check that you have correctly added your Stripe publishable key to your `Info.plist` (iOS) and `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android).
*   **3D Secure Redirect Issues:**  Verify that you have correctly configured the URL scheme in your iOS and Android project settings.
*   **Payment Sheet Issues:** Check the Stripe logs in your dashboard for more detailed error information.
*   **Apple Pay Not Working:** Ensure you've correctly configured Apple Pay in your Stripe dashboard and your Xcode project.
