# Kubernetes Health Checks with FastAPI: Ensuring Application Reliability and Availability

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. A crucial aspect of managing applications in Kubernetes is ensuring their health and availability. This is achieved through **health checks**, also known as probes. Properly configured health checks allow Kubernetes to detect and recover from application failures, preventing downtime and ensuring a smooth user experience.

This blog post will guide you through implementing effective health checks for your FastAPI applications running on Kubernetes. We'll cover the different types of health checks, how to implement them in your FastAPI application, and how to configure them within your Kubernetes deployment manifests.

## Why Health Checks Matter in Kubernetes

Without health checks, Kubernetes has limited insight into the actual state of your application. It might assume a pod is running simply because the container process is alive, even if the application is unresponsive or unable to serve requests. This can lead to routing traffic to unhealthy instances, resulting in application errors and a degraded user experience.

Health checks allow Kubernetes to automatically:

- **Restart failing pods:** If a health check fails, Kubernetes can automatically restart the pod, bringing it back to a healthy state.
- **Avoid routing traffic to unhealthy pods:** By using readiness probes, Kubernetes knows when a pod is ready to receive traffic and will only route requests to healthy instances.
- **Scale down unhealthy applications:** Kubernetes can use health check data to make informed scaling decisions, reducing the number of unhealthy pods and increasing the number of healthy ones.
- **Perform rolling updates more safely:** Health checks allow Kubernetes to gracefully update your application without downtime, ensuring that new pods are healthy before traffic is shifted to them.

## Types of Kubernetes Health Checks (Probes)

Kubernetes provides three main types of health checks, or probes:

1.  **Liveness Probe:** The liveness probe determines whether a container is running. If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container. Think of it as a check for whether the _application is alive_. It's a drastic measure, indicating the application has entered an unrecoverable state.

2.  **Readiness Probe:** The readiness probe determines whether a container is ready to accept traffic. If the readiness probe fails, Kubernetes will stop routing traffic to the pod. Think of it as a check for whether the _application is ready to serve requests_. This is useful for scenarios like initializing databases, loading configurations, or completing startup tasks.

3.  **Startup Probe (Kubernetes 1.16+):** The startup probe determines whether the application within the container has started. If this probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container. It is useful when applications have long startup times. The liveness and readiness probes won't be executed until the startup probe has succeeded. This prevents premature failures during the startup phase.

## Implementing Health Checks in FastAPI

FastAPI makes it easy to implement health checks. We can define API endpoints that perform checks on different aspects of our application.

Here's a basic example:

```plaintext
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from typing import Annotated

app = FastAPI()

# Database configuration (replace with your actual details)
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db" # or your PostgreSQL connection string
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()


# Define a simple model
class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = "items"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, index=True)


Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# Dependency to get the database session
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

db_dependency = Annotated[Session, Depends(get_db)]


@app.get("/healthz")
async def health_check():
    """
    Liveness probe endpoint.  Returns 200 OK if the application is running.
    """
    return {"status": "ok"}


@app.get("/readyz")
async def readiness_check(db: db_dependency):
    """
    Readiness probe endpoint. Checks database connectivity.  Returns 200 OK if ready.
    """
    try:
        # Try a simple database query to check connectivity
        db.query(Item).first()
        return {"status": "ok", "database": "ok"}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Database connection error: {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "database": "error"}, 500

@app.get("/")
async def root():
  return {"message": "Hello world"}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`/healthz` (Liveness Probe):** This endpoint simply returns a 200 OK status code, indicating the application is running. This is a basic liveness check.
- **`/readyz` (Readiness Probe):** This endpoint performs a more thorough check, including verifying database connectivity. It attempts to query the `Item` table. If the query is successful, it returns a 200 OK status code and a `database: ok` message. If the query fails, it returns a 500 Internal Server Error and a `database: error` message. This endpoint ensures that the application is not only running but also ready to handle requests, including accessing the database. It uses a dependency injection to get a database session.
- **Error Handling:** The `readyz` endpoint includes error handling to catch potential database connection issues and return an appropriate error response.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Complexity:** Keep health checks simple and fast. Avoid complex logic that could slow down the application or create unnecessary dependencies.
- **Dependencies:** Consider the dependencies of your application when designing health checks. The readiness probe should check all critical dependencies, such as databases, message queues, and external APIs.
- **Database Migrations:** Ensure your database is migrated _before_ the readiness probe starts checking the database connection. Otherwise, your application may be marked as unhealthy during the migration process.

## Configuring Health Checks in Kubernetes Deployment Manifests

Now that we have implemented the health check endpoints in our FastAPI application, we need to configure Kubernetes to use them. This is done in the deployment manifest file (e.g., `deployment.yaml`).

Here's an example:

```plaintext
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fastapi-app
  labels:
    app: fastapi-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fastapi-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fastapi-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: fastapi-app
          image: YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME # Replace with your Docker image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000 # Or whatever port your app listens on
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8000 # Or whatever port your app listens on
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 5
            timeoutSeconds: 2
            failureThreshold: 3
            successThreshold: 1
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /readyz
              port: 8000 # Or whatever port your app listens on
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 5
            timeoutSeconds: 2
            failureThreshold: 3
            successThreshold: 1
          # Optional: Startup Probe (if your app takes a long time to start)
          # startupProbe:
          #   httpGet:
          #     path: /healthz  # or any endpoint that is reliable during startup
          #     port: 8000
          #   initialDelaySeconds: 5
          #   periodSeconds: 5
          #   failureThreshold: 30 # Adjust based on your app's startup time
```

**Explanation:**

- **`livenessProbe`:**
  - **`httpGet`:** Specifies that the probe should perform an HTTP GET request to the `/healthz` endpoint on port 8000.
  - **`initialDelaySeconds`:** The number of seconds to wait after the container has started before the probe is initiated. A reasonable delay gives your application time to initialize.
  - **`periodSeconds`:** How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
  - **`timeoutSeconds`:** The number of seconds after which the probe times out.
  - **`failureThreshold`:** The number of consecutive failures required before Kubernetes considers the pod unhealthy and restarts it.
  - **`successThreshold`:** The minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after failing.
- **`readinessProbe`:** Similar to the `livenessProbe`, but uses the `/readyz` endpoint. The `readinessProbe` determines when a pod is ready to receive traffic.
- **`startupProbe` (Optional):**
  - If your application takes a long time to start, a startup probe can prevent premature failures from liveness and readiness probes.
  - The example uses the `/healthz` endpoint, but you can use any endpoint that is reliable during startup.
  - The `failureThreshold` is set to 30, meaning that the probe can fail up to 30 times before Kubernetes considers the startup to have failed. Adjust this value based on your application's startup time.

**Important Notes:**

- **Replace `YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` with the actual name of your Docker image.**
- **Adjust the `initialDelaySeconds`, `periodSeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, `failureThreshold`, and `successThreshold` values to match the characteristics of your application.**
- **Choose the appropriate endpoints for your liveness and readiness probes.** The liveness probe should check the basic health of the application, while the readiness probe should check all critical dependencies.
- **Consider using a startup probe if your application has a long startup time.**

## Alternatives to HTTP Probes

While HTTP probes are the most common type, Kubernetes also supports other types of probes:

- **`exec` probe:** Executes a command inside the container to determine the health status. Useful for more complex checks.
  ```plaintext
  livenessProbe:
    exec:
      command: ['/bin/sh', '-c', 'ps aux | grep my_process'] # Check if 'my_process' is running
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5
  ```
- **`tcpSocket` probe:** Attempts to open a TCP connection to a specified port on the container. Useful for checking if a service is listening on a port.
  ```plaintext
  livenessProbe:
    tcpSocket:
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    periodSeconds: 5
  ```

## Best Practices for Kubernetes Health Checks with FastAPI

- **Keep it simple:** Avoid complex logic in your health checks. Focus on the essential indicators of application health.
- **Check dependencies:** Ensure your readiness probe checks all critical dependencies.
- **Use appropriate thresholds:** Adjust the `initialDelaySeconds`, `periodSeconds`, `timeoutSeconds`, `failureThreshold`, and `successThreshold` values to match the characteristics of your application.
- **Monitor your health checks:** Use Kubernetes monitoring tools to track the success and failure rates of your health checks. This can help you identify potential problems before they impact your users.
- **Automate health check deployment:** Use infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to automate the deployment of your Kubernetes manifests, including your health check configurations.
- **Document your health checks:** Clearly document the purpose and implementation of your health checks.
- **Consider using a dedicated health check library:** Libraries can help manage health check logic and provide more advanced features. However, be mindful of adding unnecessary dependencies.

## Conclusion

Properly configured health checks are essential for ensuring the reliability and availability of your FastAPI applications running on Kubernetes. By implementing liveness and readiness probes, you can enable Kubernetes to automatically detect and recover from application failures, preventing downtime and ensuring a smooth user experience. Remember to tailor your health checks to the specific needs of your application and to monitor them regularly.
