# Mastering Presence in Chakra UI: A Comprehensive Guide to Animations and Transitions

Chakra UI offers a powerful and intuitive set of tools for building accessible and visually appealing user interfaces. Among these tools, the `Presence` component stands out as a crucial ingredient for crafting seamless and engaging user experiences. It allows you to animate components in and out of the DOM (Document Object Model) with ease, providing smooth transitions that enhance your application's overall feel.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into the `Presence` component in Chakra UI. We'll cover the fundamentals, explore various use cases with practical code examples, and equip you with the knowledge to leverage its full potential.

## What is the `Presence` Component in Chakra UI?

The `Presence` component, a core element from the `@chakra-ui/react-use-presence` package, is designed to control the visibility and animation of React components when they are mounted (added) or unmounted (removed) from the DOM. It utilizes React's render props pattern, providing you with a `isPresent` boolean value that you can use to conditionally apply styles or animations.

The key advantage of using `Presence` is that it handles the complexities of managing animation states when components enter and exit the DOM. Without it, components might abruptly disappear or appear, resulting in a jarring user experience.

## Installation

Before we start, ensure you have Chakra UI installed in your project. If not, you can install it using npm or yarn:

```plaintext
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
# or
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^6
```

Next, install the `@chakra-ui/react-use-presence` package specifically:

```plaintext
npm install @chakra-ui/react-use-presence
# or
yarn add @chakra-ui/react-use-presence
```

## Basic Usage: Fading In and Out

The simplest way to use `Presence` is to control the opacity of a component based on its presence in the DOM. Let's create a simple example where a box fades in when it's added to the DOM and fades out when it's removed.

```plaintext
import { Box } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { usePresence } from '@chakra-ui/react-use-presence'
import { useState } from 'react'

function FadeBox() {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false)
  const [isPresent, safeToRemove] = usePresence({ isPresent: isVisible })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}>Toggle Box Visibility</button>

      {isPresent && (
        <Box
          style={{
            transition: 'opacity 0.5s ease-in-out',
            opacity: isPresent ? 1 : 0,
          }}
          onAnimationComplete={() => !isPresent && safeToRemove()}
          bg="teal.500"
          color="white"
          p={4}
          mt={4}
        >
          This box will fade in and out.
        </Box>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

export default FadeBox
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We import `usePresence` from `@chakra-ui/react-use-presence` and `Box` from `@chakra-ui/react`.
2.  We use `useState` to control the visibility of the box.
3.  The `usePresence` hook takes an object with `isPresent: isVisible` as an argument. It returns an array:
    - `isPresent`: A boolean indicating whether the component is currently present in the DOM (either entering or fully visible).
    - `safeToRemove`: A function you _must_ call after the exit animation completes. This is crucial for preventing memory leaks.
4.  We conditionally render the `Box` only when `isPresent` is true.
5.  We use inline styles to control the opacity based on the `isPresent` value and add a CSS transition for a smooth fade effect. The `transition` property defines the type of animation (opacity), duration (0.5s), and easing function (ease-in-out).
6.  The `onAnimationComplete` event handler is extremely important. Once the component is no longer present, it triggers the `safeToRemove()` function. This ensures that React knows it's safe to completely unmount the component, preventing potential errors.

## Advanced Animations with `framer-motion`

For more complex animations, you can integrate `Presence` with `framer-motion`, a powerful animation library that seamlessly integrates with React. Chakra UI is designed to work beautifully with `framer-motion`.

```plaintext
import { Box } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { usePresence } from '@chakra-ui/react-use-presence'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
import { useState } from 'react'

const MotionBox = motion(Box) // Wrap Box with motion

function FramerMotionBox() {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false)
  const [isPresent, safeToRemove] = usePresence({ isPresent: isVisible })

  const variants = {
    hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -50 },
    visible: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
    exit: { opacity: 0, x: 50 },
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}>
        Toggle Box Visibility (Framer Motion)
      </button>

      {isPresent && (
        <MotionBox
          variants={variants}
          initial="hidden"
          animate="visible"
          exit="exit"
          transition={{ duration: 0.5, ease: 'easeInOut' }}
          onAnimationComplete={() => !isPresent && safeToRemove()}
          bg="purple.500"
          color="white"
          p={4}
          mt={4}
          position="relative" // Needed for exit animations
        >
          This box will slide and fade in/out.
        </MotionBox>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

export default FramerMotionBox
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We import `motion` from `framer-motion`.
2.  We use `motion(Box)` to create a `MotionBox` component that's powered by `framer-motion`. This is how you adapt any Chakra UI component to be animated with `framer-motion`.
3.  We define animation variants in the `variants` object: `hidden`, `visible`, and `exit`. These define the initial state, the animated state, and the state the component transitions to before being removed from the DOM.
4.  We use `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` props to tell `framer-motion` which variants to use at different stages.
5.  The `transition` prop allows you to customize the animation duration, easing function, and other parameters.
6.  Importantly, the container element, `MotionBox` in this case, _must_ have `position: relative` or `position: absolute` applied to it for exit animations involving position changes to work correctly.
7.  Again, the `onAnimationComplete` callback ensures proper cleanup and prevents memory leaks.

## Animating Lists with `AnimatePresence`

For animating lists of items as they are added or removed, `framer-motion` provides the `AnimatePresence` component, which works hand-in-hand with `Presence` under the hood. `AnimatePresence` automatically tracks the presence of its children and orchestrates their entrance and exit animations. It's important to note that you often _don't_ need to use `usePresence` directly when using `AnimatePresence`.

```plaintext
import { Box, List, ListItem, Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion'
import { useState } from 'react'

const MotionListItem = motion(ListItem)

function AnimatedList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'])

  const handleRemove = (index) => {
    setItems((prevItems) => prevItems.filter((_, i) => i !== index))
  }

  const handleAdd = () => {
    setItems((prevItems) => [...prevItems, `Item ${prevItems.length + 1}`])
  }

  const variants = {
    hidden: { opacity: 0, y: -20 },
    visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
    exit: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  }

  return (
    <Box>
      <Button onClick={handleAdd} mb={4}>
        Add Item
      </Button>
      <List spacing={3}>
        <AnimatePresence>
          {items.map((item, index) => (
            <MotionListItem
              key={item} // Important: Use a unique key
              variants={variants}
              initial="hidden"
              animate="visible"
              exit="exit"
              transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
              position="relative" // required for exit animations
            >
              {item}
              <Button size="sm" ml={2} onClick={() => handleRemove(index)} colorScheme="red">
                Remove
              </Button>
            </MotionListItem>
          ))}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </List>
    </Box>
  )
}

export default AnimatedList
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We wrap the list of `MotionListItem` components with `AnimatePresence`.
2.  Each `MotionListItem` needs a unique `key` prop. This is crucial for `AnimatePresence` to track items correctly as they're added and removed.
3.  We define animation variants for each list item.
4.  The container element, `MotionListItem` in this case, _must_ have `position: relative` or `position: absolute` applied to it for exit animations involving position changes to work correctly.
5.  `AnimatePresence` handles the animation orchestration automatically, ensuring smooth transitions as items enter and exit the list. You don't need to use `usePresence` directly in this case.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Always call `safeToRemove()`:** Failing to call `safeToRemove()` after the exit animation completes will lead to memory leaks and potential errors in your application.
- **Unique Keys for Lists:** When using `AnimatePresence` with lists, ensure that each item has a unique `key` prop. This allows React to efficiently track changes and apply animations correctly.
- **Positioning for Exit Animations:** If your exit animation involves changes in position (e.g., sliding, moving), the animated component _must_ have a CSS `position` property of `relative` or `absolute`.
- **Optimize Animation Performance:** Complex animations can impact performance, especially on mobile devices. Use techniques like `will-change` to hint to the browser about upcoming animations, and avoid animating properties that trigger layout reflows (e.g., width, height). Stick to animating `transform` and `opacity` where possible.
- **Accessibility:** Be mindful of accessibility when using animations. Provide options for users to disable animations if they are sensitive to motion. Keep animations short and subtle to avoid causing disorientation or seizures.

## Conclusion

The `Presence` component in Chakra UI, especially when combined with `framer-motion`, provides a powerful and flexible way to create smooth and engaging animations for your React applications. By understanding the fundamentals, applying the best practices, and avoiding common pitfalls, you can elevate your user interface and provide a delightful experience for your users. Experiment with different animation styles, integrate them seamlessly into your components, and unlock the full potential of Chakra UI's animation capabilities. Remember to always prioritize performance and accessibility when implementing animations. Happy coding!
