# Create a User Rating Scorecard with CSS: Step-by-Step Guide & Examples

User ratings are crucial for building trust and providing valuable feedback on products, services, or content. A well-designed rating scorecard can significantly enhance the user experience. This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on how to create a user rating scorecard using only CSS, making it easily customizable and lightweight. We'll cover creating star ratings, handling hover states, and styling the scorecard for accessibility and visual appeal.

## Why CSS for User Rating Scorecards?

While JavaScript libraries offer sophisticated rating systems, using CSS for the core functionality has several advantages:

- **Performance:** CSS-based solutions are generally lighter and faster to render compared to JavaScript-heavy implementations.
- **Simplicity:** For basic star rating functionality, CSS provides a cleaner and more maintainable approach.
- **Customization:** CSS allows for deep customization of the appearance and behavior of the rating scorecard, tailoring it to your website's design.
- **Accessibility:** With proper HTML structure and ARIA attributes, CSS-based rating scorecards can be made highly accessible to users with disabilities.

## Step 1: The HTML Structure

We'll start with a simple HTML structure to represent our rating scorecard. We'll use radio buttons for capturing the rating and labels for styling the stars. This approach also has the benefit of being inherently accessible.

```html
<div class="rating">
  <input type="radio" id="star5" name="rating" value="5" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star5"
    title="Awesome - 5 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star4" name="rating" value="4" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star4"
    title="Pretty good - 4 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star3" name="rating" value="3" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star3"
    title="Meh - 3 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star2" name="rating" value="2" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star2"
    title="Kinda bad - 2 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star1" name="rating" value="1" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star1"
    title="Sucks big time - 1 star"
  ></label>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- **`<div class="rating">`:** This is the container for our entire rating scorecard.
- **`<input type="radio" ...>`:** We use radio buttons because only one rating can be selected at a time. Important attributes:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the radio button.
  - `name`: All radio buttons within the same rating scorecard must share the same `name` to ensure only one can be selected.
  - `value`: Represents the numerical value of the rating (1 to 5 in this case).
- **`<label class="star" for="star[number]" ...>`:** The label acts as the clickable star. Crucial attributes:
  - `class="star"`: This class will be used to style the star icon.
  - `for="star[number]"`: Links the label to the corresponding radio button based on the `id`.
  - `title`: Provides an accessible tooltip describing the rating level.

## Step 2: CSS Styling - The Stars

Now, let's style the stars using CSS. We'll use a font icon library like Font Awesome or a custom SVG for the star. For this example, we'll use Font Awesome. You'll need to include Font Awesome in your project (either through a CDN or by installing it). If you are using a framework such as Next.js you'll also need to ensure font-awesome works with Server Side Rendering.

```plaintext
.rating {
  display: inline-block;
  unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
  direction: rtl; /* Reverse the order for visual representation */
}

.rating > input {
  display: none; /* Hide the radio buttons */
}

.rating > label {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  width: 1.1em;
  font-size: 2rem;
  color: #d3d3d3;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.rating > label:before {
  content: "\f005"; /* Font Awesome star icon */
  font-family: FontAwesome;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}

.rating > input:checked ~ label:before {
  color: #FFC107; /* Gold color for selected stars */
}

.rating > label:hover:before,
.rating > label:hover ~ label:before {
  color: #FFC107; /* Gold color for hovered stars */
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`.rating`:**
  - `display: inline-block;`: Allows the rating to be treated as a block-level element within the inline flow.
  - `unicode-bidi: bidi-override; direction: rtl;`: This is the key to making the stars appear in the correct order. We reverse the direction of the text, so the highest-rated star (star5) appears on the right and the lowest-rated star (star1) appears on the left.
- **`.rating > input`:**
  - `display: none;`: Hides the actual radio buttons, as we'll be using the labels as interactive elements.
- **`.rating > label`:**
  - `display: inline-block;`: Makes the labels display side-by-side.
  - `position: relative;`: Allows us to absolutely position the star icon within the label.
  - `width: 1.1em;`: Controls the spacing between stars. Adjust this as needed.
  - `font-size: 2rem;`: Sets the size of the star.
  - `color: #d3d3d3;`: Sets the default color of the unselected stars (gray).
  - `cursor: pointer;`: Changes the cursor to a pointer when hovering over a star.
- **`.rating > label:before`:**
  - `content: "\f005";`: Specifies the Font Awesome star icon. You can replace this with the appropriate Unicode character or SVG code for your icon.
  - `font-family: FontAwesome;`: Specifies the Font Awesome font family.
  - `position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;`: Positions the star icon within the label.
- **`.rating > input:checked ~ label:before`:**
  - `color: #FFC107;`: Changes the color of the stars that are selected (gold). The `~` (general sibling combinator) selects all sibling labels that come _after_ the checked radio button.
- **`.rating > label:hover:before, .rating > label:hover ~ label:before`:**
  - `color: #FFC107;`: Changes the color of the hovered star and all stars before it (to the right) to gold. This creates the interactive hover effect.

## Step 3: Accessibility Considerations

While our CSS-based rating scorecard is visually appealing, it's important to ensure it's accessible to all users, including those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

- **Semantic HTML:** Using radio buttons and labels provides a semantic structure that screen readers can understand.
- **`title` Attribute:** The `title` attribute on the `<label>` elements provides a description of the rating value. Screen readers will announce this text.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** While the radio buttons are visually hidden, they are still focusable. Users can navigate through them using the Tab key. Consider adding styling to the radio buttons on `:focus` to provide visual feedback.
- **ARIA Attributes (Optional but Recommended):** For more complex scenarios, consider using ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility. For example:
  - `aria-label`: Provides a more descriptive label for the rating scorecard.
  - `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow`: Indicate the minimum, maximum, and current value of the rating.

Here's an example of using ARIA attributes:

```html
<div
  class="rating"
  aria-label="Rate this item"
  aria-valuemin="1"
  aria-valuemax="5"
  aria-valuenow="0"
>
  <input type="radio" id="star5" name="rating" value="5" aria-label="5 stars" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star5"
    title="Awesome - 5 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star4" name="rating" value="4" aria-label="4 stars" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star4"
    title="Pretty good - 4 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star3" name="rating" value="3" aria-label="3 stars" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star3"
    title="Meh - 3 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star2" name="rating" value="2" aria-label="2 stars" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star2"
    title="Kinda bad - 2 stars"
  ></label>
  <input type="radio" id="star1" name="rating" value="1" aria-label="1 star" /><label
    class="star"
    for="star1"
    title="Sucks big time - 1 star"
  ></label>
</div>
```

## Step 4: Customization and Enhancement

The basic rating scorecard can be further customized and enhanced to fit your specific needs.

- **Different Icons:** Replace the Font Awesome star icon with other icons or SVGs.
- **Color Schemes:** Experiment with different color schemes for the stars and the background.
- **Number of Stars:** Adjust the number of radio buttons and labels to create a rating scale with more or fewer stars.
- **Read-Only Mode:** Add a class to the rating container to disable hover effects and prevent users from changing the rating. This can be achieved by adding `pointer-events: none;` to the `.rating.read-only` class.
- **Dynamic Star Colors:** Use CSS variables to dynamically change the star colors based on user settings or other factors.

## Example: Read-Only Mode

To implement a read-only mode:

1.  **Add a class `read-only` to the `.rating` container:** `<div class="rating read-only">...</div>`
2.  **Add the following CSS rule:**

```plaintext
.rating.read-only > label:hover:before,
.rating.read-only > label:hover ~ label:before {
  color: inherit; /* Revert to the default color */
  cursor: default;
}

.rating.read-only {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

This CSS rule disables the hover effect and makes the rating non-interactive when the `read-only` class is present. The `pointer-events: none;` rule prevents the labels from receiving any mouse events.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a foundation for creating a user rating scorecard with CSS. By leveraging HTML radio buttons, labels, and CSS styling, you can create an interactive and visually appealing rating system that is both lightweight and accessible. Remember to consider accessibility best practices and customize the scorecard to match your website's design. By using CSS effectively, you can create a user-friendly rating experience without relying on complex JavaScript libraries for the core functionality.
