# Mutation Testing for Vue.js: Boost Code Quality with Stryker Mutator

Ensuring the quality and reliability of your Vue.js applications is paramount. While unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, simply achieving high code coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code. This is where **mutation testing** comes in. Mutation testing helps you assess the effectiveness of your unit tests by introducing small, artificial changes (mutations) to your source code and then running your tests to see if they can detect these changes. If your tests fail to catch these mutations, it indicates a potential weakness in your test suite.

This blog post will guide you through implementing mutation testing in your Vue.js projects using the powerful and popular [Stryker Mutator](https://stryker-mutator.io/). We'll cover everything from setup to interpretation of results, empowering you to write more robust and reliable Vue.js applications.

## What is Mutation Testing?

At its core, mutation testing involves the following steps:

1.  **Introducing Mutations:** The mutation testing tool automatically introduces small changes (mutations) to your source code. These changes might include:

    - Changing a `+` to a `-`
    - Replacing `>` with `>=`
    - Deleting a line of code
    - Replacing `true` with `false`

2.  **Running Tests:** For each mutation, your existing unit tests are executed.

3.  **Analyzing Results:** Based on the test results, each mutation is classified as either:

    - **Killed:** The tests failed, indicating that the mutation was detected. This is the desired outcome. It means your tests are effective at catching this type of change.
    - **Survived:** The tests passed, indicating that the mutation was _not_ detected. This highlights a weakness in your test suite. You need to improve your tests to cover this scenario.
    - **Timed Out:** The tests took too long to run, usually due to an infinite loop introduced by the mutation.
    - **No Coverage:** The mutated code was not covered by any tests.
    - **Compile Error:** The mutated code resulted in a compilation error.

4.  **Improving Tests:** Analyze the surviving mutations and update your tests to ensure they detect these changes.

## Why Use Mutation Testing in Your Vue.js Projects?

- **Reveals Blind Spots in Your Tests:** High code coverage doesn't mean your tests are effective. Mutation testing uncovers areas where your tests are insufficient.
- **Improves Test Quality:** By addressing surviving mutations, you create more comprehensive and robust tests.
- **Reduces Bugs:** Better tests lead to fewer bugs in your production code.
- **Increases Confidence:** Mutation testing provides a higher level of confidence in the reliability of your codebase.
- **Actionable Insights:** Mutation testing provides specific feedback on _how_ to improve your tests.

## Implementing Mutation Testing with Stryker Mutator in Vue.js

Let's dive into the practical steps of setting up and running Stryker Mutator in a Vue.js project. We'll assume you have a Vue.js project already set up with unit tests using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

### 1. Install Stryker Mutator and Required Plugins

First, install Stryker and the necessary plugins for your project. The specific plugins depend on your testing framework and JavaScript dialect. Here's an example using Jest and TypeScript (assuming you're using TypeScript):

```plaintext
npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/core @stryker-mutator/jest-runner @stryker-mutator/typescript-checker stryker
```

If you're using JavaScript instead of TypeScript, you don't need `@stryker-mutator/typescript-checker`. If you are using Mocha instead of Jest, install `@stryker-mutator/mocha-runner`. And so on. Make sure you choose the correct plugins compatible with your testing environment.

### 2. Configure Stryker

Create a `stryker.conf.js` (or `stryker.conf.json`, or `stryker.config.cjs`, etc. â€“ Stryker supports various configuration formats) file in the root of your project. This file defines how Stryker will run. Here's a basic example configuration for Jest with TypeScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @type {import('@stryker-mutator/api/core').StrykerOptions}
 */
module.exports = {
  packageManager: 'npm',
  reporters: ['html', 'clear-text', 'progress'],
  mutate: ['src/**/*.ts', 'src/**/*.vue'], // Specify files to mutate
  testRunner: 'jest',
  jest: {
    projectType: 'custom', // Specify that you have your own jest config file
    config: require('./jest.config.js'), // Path to your jest config
  },
  transpilers: [],
  checkers: ['typescript'],
  tsconfigFile: 'tsconfig.json', // Path to your tsconfig.json file
  concurrency: 2,
  logLevel: 'info',
  thresholds: { high: 80, low: 60, break: 40 }, // Set mutation score thresholds
  ignorePatterns: ['**/node_modules/**', 'dist/**'],
}
```

**Explanation of Configuration Options:**

- **`packageManager`:** Specifies the package manager (e.g., 'npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm').
- **`reporters`:** Specifies the reporters to use. `'html'` generates a detailed HTML report, `'clear-text'` shows the results in the console, and `'progress'` provides a progress indicator.
- **`mutate`:** An array of glob patterns specifying which files should be mutated. Adjust this to target your Vue.js components and related TypeScript/JavaScript files. Crucially, include both `.vue` files and the `.ts` or `.js` files that contain your component logic.
- **`testRunner`:** Specifies the test runner (e.g., 'jest', 'mocha').
- **`jest`:** Configuration options specific to Jest. The example assumes you have a custom Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`).
- **`transpilers`:** Normally set to an empty array. Use `['typescript']` if you are running Stryker on transpiled JavaScript code.
- **`checkers`**: Specifies the TypeScript checker. Use `['typescript']` if you are using Typescript and want type checking during mutation testing.
- **`tsconfigFile`:** The path to your `tsconfig.json` file.
- **`concurrency`:** The number of concurrent test runners. Adjust this based on your machine's resources. A higher number can speed up the process but might strain your system.
- **`logLevel`:** Specifies the logging level (e.g., 'info', 'debug', 'warn', 'error').
- **`thresholds`:** Sets the thresholds for the mutation score. Stryker will report warnings or errors if the score falls below these thresholds.
- **`ignorePatterns`:** Specifies files or directories to ignore during mutation testing.

**Important Notes:**

- **Adjust the `mutate` array carefully.** Only include the files that you want to mutate. Mutating node_modules or other external libraries is unnecessary and can significantly slow down the process.
- **Ensure your Jest configuration is correct.** Stryker relies on Jest to run your tests.
- **Adjust `concurrency` based on your machine's resources.**

### 3. Run Stryker

Now you're ready to run Stryker. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```plaintext
npx stryker run
```

Stryker will begin mutating your code, running your tests, and analyzing the results. This process can take some time, especially for larger projects.

### 4. Analyze the Results

Once Stryker finishes, it will display a summary in the console. More importantly, it will generate an HTML report (if you configured the `'html'` reporter) in the `stryker-report` directory. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the detailed report.

The HTML report provides a breakdown of the mutations, their status (Killed, Survived, Timed Out, No Coverage, Compile Error), and the location of the mutated code.

**Focus on the "Survived" mutations.** These are the mutations that your tests failed to detect, indicating areas where your tests need improvement.

### 5. Improve Your Tests

Examine the surviving mutations in the report. Understand what the mutation did and why your tests didn't catch it. Then, modify your tests to cover these scenarios.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a simple Vue.js component called `Counter.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent, ref } from 'vue'

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'Counter',
  setup() {
    const count = ref(0)

    const increment = () => {
      count.value++
    }

    return {
      count,
      increment,
    }
  },
})
</script>
```

And an initial test in `Counter.spec.ts`:

```typescript
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Counter from '@/components/Counter.vue'

describe('Counter.vue', () => {
  it('renders the initial count', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(Counter)
    expect(wrapper.find('p').text()).toContain('Count: 0')
  })

  it('increments the count when the button is clicked', async () => {
    const wrapper = mount(Counter)
    await wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')
    expect(wrapper.find('p').text()).toContain('Count: 1')
  })
})
```

Now, let's say Stryker mutates the `increment` function to:

```typescript
const increment = () => {
  // count.value++; // Original code
  count.value // Mutated code (value is read but not incremented)
}
```

Your existing tests might still pass, because they only check if the count _eventually_ increments. They don't verify that the `increment` function is _actually_ incrementing the value.

To fix this, you could modify your test to verify that the count is indeed incremented _after_ the button click:

```typescript
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Counter from '@/components/Counter.vue'

describe('Counter.vue', () => {
  it('renders the initial count', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(Counter)
    expect(wrapper.find('p').text()).toContain('Count: 0')
  })

  it('increments the count when the button is clicked', async () => {
    const wrapper = mount(Counter)
    const button = wrapper.find('button')
    await button.trigger('click')
    // Verify count is incremented after the click.
    expect(wrapper.find('p').text()).toContain('Count: 1')

    // Check state directly to confirm
    expect((wrapper.vm as any).count).toBe(1) // Access the 'count' from the view model
  })
})
```

By adding the extra check by accessing the `count` from the view model, you've strengthened your test to detect this type of mutation.

### 6. Iterate

Repeat steps 3-5 until you are satisfied with your mutation score and the quality of your tests. Aim for a high mutation score (e.g., 80% or higher), but remember that the ultimate goal is to improve the reliability of your code. Focus on writing meaningful tests that catch real-world bugs.

## Advanced Stryker Configuration and Features

Stryker offers a wide range of configuration options and features to tailor it to your specific needs. Here are a few highlights:

- **Mutator Configuration:** You can control which types of mutations Stryker introduces using the `mutator` option. For example, you can disable specific mutators that you find are not useful in your context.

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    // ... other options
    mutator: {
      excludedMutations: ['StringLiteral'], // Exclude mutations of string literals
    },
  }
  ```

- **Test Selection:** Stryker can selectively run only the tests that are relevant to the mutated code. This can significantly speed up the mutation testing process, especially for large projects.

- **Baseline Reporting:** Stryker can compare the results of the current mutation testing run with a previous run, allowing you to track progress and identify regressions.

- **Dashboard Reporting:** Integrate Stryker with a dashboard service to visualize your mutation testing results and track your mutation score over time.

- **Stryker Plugins:** Extend Stryker's functionality with plugins for different testing frameworks, languages, and reporting tools.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

- **Slow Execution:** Mutation testing can be time-consuming. Optimize your tests, use test selection, and adjust the concurrency setting to improve performance. Consider running Stryker in CI/CD pipelines to detect regressions automatically.
- **Irrelevant Mutations:** Some mutations might be irrelevant or trivial. Exclude them using the `mutator` configuration.
- **Flaky Tests:** Flaky tests can interfere with mutation testing. Fix any flaky tests before running Stryker.
- **Code Coverage Issues:** If your code coverage is low, Stryker might not be able to mutate all parts of your codebase. Improve your code coverage by writing more comprehensive tests.
