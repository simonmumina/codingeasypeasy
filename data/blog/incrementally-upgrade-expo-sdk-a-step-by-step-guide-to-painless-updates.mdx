# Incrementally Upgrade Expo SDK: A Step-by-Step Guide to Painless Updates

Upgrading your Expo SDK is crucial for staying up-to-date with the latest features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. However, a large jump in SDK versions can sometimes lead to compatibility issues and unexpected problems. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to incrementally upgrade your Expo SDK version, minimizing risks and ensuring a smoother transition.

## Why Incremental Upgrades?

Instead of jumping directly from, say, SDK 46 to SDK 50, consider upgrading incrementally (e.g., 46 -> 47 -> 48 -> 49 -> 50). This approach offers several benefits:

- **Reduced Risk:** Smaller changes are easier to manage and debug. Identifying the source of any issues becomes significantly simpler.
- **Gradual Learning Curve:** Familiarize yourself with the changes and deprecations introduced in each SDK version before moving on to the next.
- **Improved Stability:** Allows you to test your app thoroughly after each upgrade, catching potential problems early.
- **Easier Rollback:** If an upgrade introduces an unresolvable issue, reverting to the previous SDK version is much simpler and less disruptive.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:** Make sure you have a recent, supported version of Node.js and npm (or yarn) on your system.
- **Expo CLI installed:** You'll need the Expo CLI to manage your project. Install it globally using:

  ```plaintext
  npm install -g expo-cli
  # or
  yarn global add expo-cli
  ```

- **A Git repository (recommended):** Using Git is crucial for tracking changes and easily reverting if necessary. Initialize a Git repository if you haven't already:

  ```plaintext
  git init
  ```

- **A testing strategy:** Have a clear plan for testing your application after each SDK upgrade. This could involve manual testing, automated tests, or a combination of both. Prioritize testing core functionalities first.

## Step-by-Step Upgrade Process

Let's break down the incremental upgrade process into manageable steps:

**1. Check Your Current Expo SDK Version:**

First, determine your project's current Expo SDK version. You can find this in your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file under the `sdkVersion` key. For example:

```plaintext
// app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyApp",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "sdkVersion": "46.0.0"
    // ... other configurations
  }
}
```

**2. Determine the Target SDK Version:**

Decide which SDK version you want to upgrade to next. Consult the [Expo SDK release notes](https://blog.expo.dev/) to understand the changes, deprecations, and new features introduced in each version. Consider factors like stability, required features, and community support when making your decision.

**3. Update Expo CLI (Optional, but Recommended):**

Keeping your Expo CLI up-to-date is important for compatibility. Upgrade the Expo CLI globally:

```plaintext
npm update -g expo-cli
# or
yarn global upgrade expo-cli
```

**4. Upgrade Expo Package Versions:**

This is the core step. Use the `expo upgrade` command to update your Expo-related packages to the versions compatible with your target SDK. For example, to upgrade to SDK 47:

```plaintext
expo upgrade 47
```

This command will:

- Update your `package.json` with the correct versions of `expo`, `react-native`, and other Expo-related packages.
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` (depending on your package manager) to install the updated packages.
- Update your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file to reflect the new `sdkVersion`.

**Important Considerations After Running `expo upgrade`:**

- **Conflicts:** Pay close attention to any conflicts that arise during the upgrade process. Resolve them carefully by examining the changes and making informed decisions. Use your Git diffing tools to help understand the changes.
- **Deprecated Packages:** The upgrade process might flag deprecated packages. Start planning for their replacement or removal. The Expo documentation will provide guidance on alternatives.

**5. Review the Updated Package.json and app.json/app.config.js:**

Carefully examine the changes made to your `package.json` and `app.json`/`app.config.js` files. Ensure the `sdkVersion` is correctly set, and all dependencies are updated as expected.

**6. Install Dependencies:**

If the `expo upgrade` command didn't automatically run `npm install` or `yarn install`, run it manually now:

```plaintext
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**7. Update Your Code (If Necessary):**

Review the Expo SDK release notes for your target version. Identify any breaking changes, deprecations, or API updates that require modifications to your code.

**Example: Deprecated `FileSystem.readAsStringAsync` (hypothetical):**

Let's say Expo SDK 47 deprecated the `FileSystem.readAsStringAsync` function and introduced `FileSystem.readAsString` as its replacement. You would need to find all instances of `FileSystem.readAsStringAsync` in your code and update them.

```plaintext
// Before (SDK 46):
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'

async function readFileContent(uri) {
  try {
    const content = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(uri, {
      encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.UTF8,
    })
    return content
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', error)
    return null
  }
}

// After (SDK 47):
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'

async function readFileContent(uri) {
  try {
    const content = await FileSystem.readAsString(uri, { encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.UTF8 })
    return content
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', error)
    return null
  }
}
```

**8. Clean Your Project:**

Before building your project, clean your cache and build artifacts:

```plaintext
expo start -c # or expo cache:clear
npm start -- --reset-cache #If using npm
yarn start -- --reset-cache #If using yarn
```

This ensures you're starting with a clean slate and avoids potential issues caused by cached data.

**9. Test Thoroughly:**

This is arguably the most critical step. Test your application extensively after each upgrade. Focus on core functionalities first. Use a combination of manual and automated testing.

- **Run in Expo Go:** Test on both iOS and Android using the Expo Go app.
- **Build Standalone Apps (if applicable):** If you build standalone apps, rebuild and test them to ensure compatibility.
- **Run Your Test Suite:** Execute your automated test suite to catch any regressions.

**Areas to Focus on During Testing:**

- **Navigation:** Verify that navigation flows work correctly.
- **Data Fetching:** Ensure data is fetched and displayed correctly.
- **User Interface:** Check for any visual regressions or layout issues.
- **Platform-Specific Functionality:** Test platform-specific features (e.g., push notifications, camera access) on both iOS and Android.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Pay special attention to third-party libraries, as they may have compatibility issues with the new SDK version.

**10. Commit Your Changes:**

Once you've thoroughly tested your application and are confident that the upgrade was successful, commit your changes to Git:

```plaintext
git add .
git commit -m "Upgrade to Expo SDK X"
```

**11. Repeat for the Next SDK Version:**

Repeat steps 2-10 for each subsequent SDK version until you reach your desired target.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter during an Expo SDK upgrade and how to troubleshoot them:

- **Dependency Conflicts:** Carefully examine the error messages and resolve conflicting dependencies by updating them to compatible versions. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to identify dependency conflicts.
- **"Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "..." was not found in the UIManager."**: This usually indicates a missing or incorrect native module. Try reinstalling your dependencies:

  ```plaintext
  rm -rf node_modules
  npm install
  # or
  rm -rf node_modules
  yarn install
  ```

  If that doesn't work, try clearing the Expo cache:

  ```plaintext
  expo start -c
  ```

- **Build Errors:** Build errors can indicate code that is incompatible with the new SDK version. Carefully examine the error messages and update your code accordingly.
- **App Crashing on Startup:** This can be caused by a variety of issues, including native module problems, incorrect configurations, or unhandled exceptions. Use debugging tools to identify the cause of the crash.
- **White screen or strange behavior**: Always try cleaning your cache after any upgrade. Run `expo start -c` or `expo cache:clear`.
- **Third-party libraries errors**: Check the compatibility of the third-party libraries with your target SDK version and if necessary update the third-party library to the latest version.

## Best Practices for Smooth Upgrades

- **Read the Release Notes:** Thoroughly review the Expo SDK release notes for each version you're upgrading to. Understand the changes, deprecations, and new features.
- **Start Early:** Don't wait until the last minute to upgrade your SDK. Start the upgrade process well in advance of any deadlines.
- **Test on Real Devices:** Testing on real devices is crucial, as simulators may not always accurately reflect the behavior of your app on a physical device.
- **Use a CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate your SDK upgrade process into your CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and ensure that changes are properly validated.
- **Document Your Process:** Keep a detailed record of the steps you took during the upgrade process, including any issues you encountered and how you resolved them. This documentation will be valuable for future upgrades.
- **Don't Skip Versions:** While theoretically possible to skip multiple SDK versions, it's highly recommended to upgrade incrementally. This minimizes risk and makes debugging much easier.

## Conclusion

Incrementally upgrading your Expo SDK is a best practice that can significantly reduce the risk of introducing bugs and breaking changes into your application. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure a smoother, more manageable upgrade process. Remember to test thoroughly after each upgrade and to consult the Expo SDK release notes for important information about each version. Happy upgrading!
