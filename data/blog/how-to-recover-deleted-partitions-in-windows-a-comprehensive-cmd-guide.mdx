# How to Recover Deleted Partitions in Windows: A Comprehensive CMD Guide

Losing a partition can be a nightmare scenario. Whether it was a mistake, a system error, or a virus attack, the feeling of potentially losing your data is stressful. Thankfully, recovering deleted partitions in Windows is often possible, and this guide will walk you through the process, focusing specifically on using the Command Prompt (CMD) and alternative methods.

## Understanding Partition Deletion and Recovery

Before diving into the recovery process, it's crucial to understand what happens when a partition is deleted. When you delete a partition, you're essentially removing its entry from the partition table. The actual data on the disk might still be intact, but the operating system can no longer recognize it or access it. This means the space becomes "unallocated" or "free," ready to be overwritten.

Therefore, **time is of the essence.** The sooner you attempt recovery, the higher your chances of success. **Avoid writing any new data to the affected disk** as this could overwrite the data you're trying to recover, making it irretrievable.

## Methods for Recovering Deleted Partitions

This guide will focus on these methods:

1.  **Using Diskpart in CMD (Command Prompt):** This method is most effective when the partition table is corrupted, but the partition data remains largely untouched.
2.  **Using TestDisk (Free and Open-Source):**  A powerful command-line tool designed specifically for partition recovery.
3.  **Using Windows Disk Management:**  Can sometimes help assign a drive letter to a seemingly lost partition.
4.  **Professional Data Recovery Software (Paid):**  For more complex scenarios or when other methods fail.

## Method 1: Recovering Deleted Partitions Using Diskpart in CMD

Diskpart is a powerful command-line utility in Windows for managing disks and partitions. It allows you to list, create, delete, and format partitions. Here's how to use it to attempt partition recovery:

**Important Considerations Before You Begin:**

*   **Identify the Correct Disk:** Incorrect disk selection can lead to further data loss. Double-check the disk number carefully.
*   **Backup Your Data (If Possible):** If you can access any other partitions on the same drive, back up crucial data before proceeding.
*   **Run CMD as Administrator:** Diskpart requires administrative privileges to function correctly.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1.  **Open Command Prompt as Administrator:**
    *   Type `cmd` in the Windows search bar.
    *   Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator."

2.  **Start Diskpart:**
    *   In the command prompt window, type `diskpart` and press Enter.

    ```
    diskpart
    ```

3.  **List Disks:**
    *   Type `list disk` and press Enter.  This will display a list of all connected disks and their sizes.

    ```
    list disk
    ```

    *   **Identify the disk that contained the deleted partition.**  Pay close attention to the size of the disk to avoid selecting the wrong one. Let's assume the disk with the deleted partition is `Disk 1`.

4.  **Select the Disk:**
    *   Type `select disk 1` (replace `1` with the correct disk number) and press Enter.

    ```
    select disk 1
    ```

    *   You should see a confirmation message: "Disk 1 is now the selected disk."

5.  **List Partitions:**
    *   Type `list partition` and press Enter. This will show the existing partitions on the selected disk. You should see the missing partition. If you only see existing partitions, this method may not be sufficient, and you may need to consider using TestDisk or professional data recovery software.  If the deleted partition is represented by unallocated space, proceed to the next steps.

    ```
    list partition
    ```

6.  **If the Partition is Still Visible (but without a drive letter):**  It's possible the partition is still present but lacking a drive letter. In this case, you can assign a drive letter.

    *   **List Volumes:** Type `list volume` and press Enter to see all volumes on your system.

        ```
        list volume
        ```

    *   **Identify the Volume Corresponding to the Deleted Partition:**  Look for a volume without a drive letter and which corresponds to the size of the deleted partition.

    *   **Select the Volume:** Type `select volume <volume number>` (replace `<volume number>` with the correct number). For example:  `select volume 3`

        ```
        select volume 3
        ```

    *   **Assign a Drive Letter:** Type `assign letter=<drive letter>` (replace `<drive letter>` with a letter that is not currently in use). For example: `assign letter=E`

        ```
        assign letter=E
        ```

    *   Windows should now assign the drive letter, and the partition should become accessible again.

7.  **If the partition is NOT listed and shows as Unallocated space:** This is a more complex scenario and Diskpart alone may not be sufficient.  You'll need to use specialized partition recovery software like TestDisk (covered below) or a professional data recovery tool.  Continuing with Diskpart in this scenario is generally not recommended as it could lead to further data loss.

8.  **Exit Diskpart:**
    *   Type `exit` and press Enter to exit the Diskpart utility.

    ```
    exit
    ```

**Important Cautions:**

*   Be extremely careful when using Diskpart. Incorrect commands can lead to permanent data loss.
*   If you are unsure about any step, consult with a data recovery professional.
*   This method is most effective if the partition table has been corrupted, but the data within the partition remains intact.  If the data has been overwritten, recovery might be impossible.

## Method 2: Recovering Deleted Partitions Using TestDisk

TestDisk is a powerful, free, and open-source data recovery tool. It's designed to help you recover lost partitions and make non-bootable disks bootable again.

**Key Features of TestDisk:**

1.  **Download and Install TestDisk:**
    *   Download TestDisk from its official website: [https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk)
    *   Extract the downloaded archive to a folder on your computer.  No installation is required.

2.  **Run TestDisk:**
    *   Navigate to the folder where you extracted TestDisk.
    *   Run the `testdisk_win.exe` file (or the appropriate executable for your operating system). You'll need to run it with administrator privileges.

3.  **Select the Log File Option:**
    *   TestDisk will ask if you want to create a log file.  Choose "Create" (recommended) and press Enter. This helps in debugging and analyzing the recovery process.

4.  **Select the Disk:**
    *   TestDisk will display a list of detected disks.  Use the up/down arrow keys to select the disk that contained the deleted partition and press Enter.  **Double-check the disk size to ensure you select the correct one.**

5.  **Select Partition Table Type:**
    *   TestDisk will attempt to detect the partition table type.  In most cases, it will correctly identify it. If so, select the suggested type (usually "Intel/PC partition") and press Enter. If you're unsure, let TestDisk detect it automatically.

6.  **Select "Analyse":**
    *   From the TestDisk menu, select "Analyse" and press Enter. This will start the analysis of the disk's partition structure.

7.  **Quick Search:**
    *   After the analysis, select "Quick Search" and press Enter. TestDisk will search for deleted partitions.

8.  **Examine the Results:**
    *   TestDisk will display a list of found partitions.  Deleted partitions are typically marked in green.
    *   Use the arrow keys to navigate through the list of partitions.
    *   **Pay close attention to the partition sizes and file system types.**  Try to identify the partition you're trying to recover.  You might need to use the "P" key to list files within the partition to help identify it (this only works if the file system is relatively intact).

9.  **Write the Partition Table (if the correct partitions are found):**
    *   **This is a critical step. Make sure you've correctly identified the deleted partition(s) before proceeding.**
    *   If TestDisk has found the correct partitions, select "Write" and press Enter.  This will write the recovered partition table to the disk.

10. **Confirm the Write:**
    *   TestDisk will ask for confirmation. Type "y" (for yes) and press Enter to confirm.

11. **Reboot Your Computer:**
    *   After writing the partition table, TestDisk will instruct you to reboot your computer.  Do so.

12. **Check if the Partition is Recovered:**
    *   After rebooting, check if the deleted partition is now visible in Windows Explorer and accessible.

**Important Considerations for TestDisk:**

*   **Data Overwrite:**  Like Diskpart, avoid writing any new data to the affected disk before running TestDisk.
*   **Backup (If Possible):**  If you can access any other partitions, back up critical data before running TestDisk.
*   **Read the Documentation:**  TestDisk has extensive documentation on its website.  Refer to it if you encounter any difficulties.

## Method 3: Using Windows Disk Management

Sometimes, a deleted partition might simply be missing a drive letter. Windows Disk Management can help assign a drive letter, making the partition accessible again.

**Steps to Assign a Drive Letter in Disk Management:**

1.  **Open Disk Management:**
    *   Right-click on the Windows Start button and select "Disk Management."
    *   Alternatively, press `Windows key + R`, type `diskmgmt.msc`, and press Enter.

2.  **Locate the Missing Partition:**
    *   Look for a partition that is displayed as "Healthy (Primary Partition)" but doesn't have a drive letter assigned. It will likely be labeled as "RAW" or "Unformatted" if its file system is damaged, but try assigning a drive letter first.  The size should match your deleted partition.

3.  **Assign a Drive Letter:**
    *   Right-click on the partition without a drive letter.
    *   Select "Change Drive Letter and Paths..."

4.  **Add a Drive Letter:**
    *   Click the "Add" button.
    *   Select a drive letter from the dropdown menu and click "OK."

5.  **Check if the Partition is Accessible:**
    *   Open Windows Explorer and check if the partition is now visible and accessible with the assigned drive letter.

**Limitations of Disk Management:**

*   Disk Management is primarily useful for assigning drive letters or performing basic partition management.
*   It cannot recover partitions that have been completely deleted or corrupted beyond repair.
*   It is not as powerful or flexible as Diskpart or TestDisk.

## Method 4: Professional Data Recovery Software (Paid)

If the methods above fail, professional data recovery software might be your last resort. These tools often employ advanced scanning algorithms and techniques to recover data from severely damaged or overwritten partitions.
