# Generate TypeScript Types from OpenAPI/Swagger Schemas with @hey-api/openapi-ts

In the world of API development, maintaining consistency and accuracy between your API definition and your client-side code is crucial.  Manually creating TypeScript types that mirror your API's structure can be time-consuming and error-prone.  That's where code generation tools like `@hey-api/openapi-ts` come in.

This blog post will guide you through the benefits of using `@hey-api/openapi-ts` and provide practical examples of how to integrate it into your development workflow to automatically generate TypeScript types from your OpenAPI (Swagger) schemas.

## What is `@hey-api/openapi-ts`?

`@hey-api/openapi-ts` is a powerful command-line tool and library that allows you to generate TypeScript types directly from your OpenAPI or Swagger specification files. It simplifies API integration by providing type-safe interfaces that accurately represent your API's request and response structures.  Think of it as a bridge between your API definition and your TypeScript code, ensuring type safety and reducing the risk of runtime errors.

**Key Features:**

*   **Automatic Type Generation:** Generates TypeScript interfaces, enums, and type aliases based on your OpenAPI schema.
*   **Swagger/OpenAPI Support:** Supports both Swagger (OpenAPI 2.0) and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.
*   **Customizable Output:** Offers configuration options to customize the generated code to fit your project's needs.
*   **CLI Tool:** Provides a command-line interface for easy integration into your build process.
*   **JavaScript API:**  Allows programmatic usage within your JavaScript or TypeScript code.
*   **Handles Complex Schemas:**  Capable of handling complex schema definitions, including nested objects, arrays, and references.
*   **Supports Multiple File Formats:**  Accepts OpenAPI/Swagger specifications in YAML and JSON formats.
*   **Improved Developer Experience:**  Reduces boilerplate code and improves code maintainability.

## Why Use `@hey-api/openapi-ts`?

Here's a breakdown of the benefits of using `@hey-api/openapi-ts`:

## Getting Started with `@hey-api/openapi-ts`

Let's walk through the process of setting up and using `@hey-api/openapi-ts` in your project.

### 1. Installation

First, install the package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install -D @hey-api/openapi-ts
# or
yarn add -D @hey-api/openapi-ts
```

We install it as a dev dependency (`-D`) because it's primarily used during the build process.

### 2. Preparing Your OpenAPI Specification

You'll need an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification file in either YAML (`.yaml` or `.yml`) or JSON (`.json`) format.  If you don't have one, you can find example specifications online or generate one from your API backend using tools like Swagger UI or Swagger Editor.

For this example, let's assume you have a file named `openapi.yaml` with the following simplified content:

```yaml
# openapi.yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: My Awesome API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Get all users
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: integer
                      format: int64
                    name:
                      type: string
                    email:
                      type: string
```

### 3. Using the CLI

The easiest way to use `@hey-api/openapi-ts` is through its command-line interface.  You can add a script to your `package.json` to run the generator.

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate-types": "openapi-ts openapi.yaml -o src/types/api.ts"
  }
}
```

In this example:

*   `openapi-ts` is the command to execute the generator.
*   `openapi.yaml` is the path to your OpenAPI specification file.
*   `-o src/types/api.ts` specifies the output file where the generated TypeScript types will be saved.  You can adjust this path to suit your project structure.

Now, you can run the script from your terminal:

```bash
npm run generate-types
# or
yarn generate-types
```

This will generate a `api.ts` file inside the `src/types` directory (which you may need to create if it doesn't exist).

### 4. Examining the Generated TypeScript

The generated `src/types/api.ts` file will contain TypeScript interfaces and types corresponding to your OpenAPI schema.  Based on the example `openapi.yaml` above, the generated file might look something like this:

```typescript
/**
 * This file was auto-generated by openapi-ts.
 * Do not make direct changes to the file.
 */

export interface User {
  id?: number;
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
}

export type GetUsersResponse = User[];
```

As you can see, `openapi-ts` has automatically generated:

*   An interface `User` representing the structure of a user object in the API response.
*   A type alias `GetUsersResponse` representing the array of `User` objects returned by the `/users` endpoint.

### 5. Using the Generated Types in Your Code

Now you can import and use these generated types in your TypeScript code when interacting with your API.

```typescript
import { GetUsersResponse } from './types/api';

async function fetchUsers(): Promise<GetUsersResponse> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/users'); // Replace with your actual API endpoint
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

async function displayUsers() {
  const users = await fetchUsers();
  users.forEach(user => {
    console.log(`User: ${user.name} (${user.email})`);
  });
}

displayUsers();
```

Thanks to the generated types, you now have type safety when working with the API response. TypeScript will warn you if you try to access properties that don't exist or if you assign incorrect types to variables.

## Advanced Usage and Configuration

`@hey-api/openapi-ts` offers several options for customizing the generated code and integrating it more deeply into your development workflow.

### Configuration Options

You can configure the generator using command-line options or by providing a configuration file. Some common options include:

*   `-o, --output <path>`: Specifies the output file path (as seen in the example above).
*   `--name <name>`: Sets the root name of the generated types.
*   `--client <client>`: Generates a client module using `axios`, `fetch`, or a custom function.
*   `--clean`:  Removes the output file before generating new types.  Useful for ensuring a clean build.
*   `--exportSchemas`: Exports all schemas as named types.
*   `--request`: Specifies the request library to use when generating a client.
*   `--immutableTypes`:  Generates immutable types (using `readonly` properties).
*   `--enumStyle <style>`: Defines the way enums are generated (e.g., `enum`, `union`).

For a complete list of options, refer to the `@hey-api/openapi-ts` documentation.

### Configuration File

You can create a `openapi-ts.config.js` or `openapi-ts.config.ts` file in your project root to configure the generator. This is useful for managing complex configurations.

Example `openapi-ts.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  input: 'openapi.yaml',
  output: 'src/types/api.ts',
  name: 'MyAPI',
  clean: true,
  exportSchemas: true
};
```

Then, you can simply run:

```bash
openapi-ts
```

The generator will automatically read the configuration from the file.

### Generating an API Client

`@hey-api/openapi-ts` can also generate a complete API client based on your OpenAPI specification. This is a powerful feature that can significantly reduce the amount of code you need to write.

To generate a client using the `fetch` API, for example, you can use the `--client fetch` option:

```bash
openapi-ts openapi.yaml -o src/api/client.ts --client fetch
```

This will generate a `client.ts` file that includes functions for making API calls to each endpoint defined in your specification. The generated client will automatically handle request and response serialization, error handling, and type safety.

You can then import and use the generated client functions in your code.

## Example: Generating an API Client with `fetch`

Here's an example of using the generated client functions:

```typescript
// src/api/client.ts (Generated by openapi-ts with --client fetch)

// ... (Generated code for API client) ...

// src/components/UserList.tsx
import { getUsers } from '../api/client';

async function UserList() {
  const users = await getUsers();

  if (!users) {
    return <div>Error fetching users.</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name} ({user.email})</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default UserList;
```

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Command not found" error:**  Ensure that `@hey-api/openapi-ts` is installed correctly as a dev dependency. Double-check your `package.json` file and try running `npm install` or `yarn install` again.

*   **Type errors in generated code:** Review your OpenAPI specification for any errors or inconsistencies.  Ensure that your schema definitions are valid and accurate.  You can use online validators to check your OpenAPI specification.

*   **Generator not producing the desired output:**  Experiment with the configuration options to customize the generated code.  Refer to the `@hey-api/openapi-ts` documentation for a detailed explanation of each option.

*   **Large OpenAPI specifications:** For very large OpenAPI specifications, consider splitting them into smaller files or using the `--split` option to generate separate files for different parts of your API.
