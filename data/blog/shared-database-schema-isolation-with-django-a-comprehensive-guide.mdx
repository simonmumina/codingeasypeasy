# Shared Database, Schema Isolation with Django: A Comprehensive Guide

Building a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application often requires handling multiple tenants, each needing its own isolated environment. One approach to achieve this is through **shared database, schema isolation**. This strategy allows multiple tenants to share a single database instance while maintaining data separation by placing each tenant's data within a separate schema. This offers a balance between resource utilization and data security.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of implementing shared database, schema isolation in Django using PostgreSQL. We'll cover everything from database setup and Django configuration to middleware implementation, tenant-aware models, and essential considerations for building scalable and secure applications.

## What is Shared Database, Schema Isolation?

Shared database, schema isolation, also known as multi-schema tenancy, is a database architecture where:

- **Shared Database:** All tenants share the same physical database server.
- **Schema Isolation:** Each tenant's data is stored within its own separate database schema.

Think of it like an apartment building. The entire building (the database server) is shared, but each apartment (schema) belongs to a different tenant, with its own walls and locked doors (data isolation).

**Advantages of Schema Isolation:**

- **Cost-Effective:** Reduced infrastructure costs by sharing database resources.
- **Simplified Management:** Easier to manage a single database instance.
- **Logical Separation:** Maintains logical data separation between tenants.
- **Easier Backups:** Can backup and restore individual schemas.
- **Faster Tenant Onboarding:** Creating a new tenant is as simple as creating a new schema.

**Disadvantages of Schema Isolation:**

- **Complexity:** Requires careful implementation to avoid security vulnerabilities and performance issues.
- **Database Size Limits:** Although each tenant is isolated in the schema, database size limits still apply on the database as a whole.
- **Potential for Data Leakage:** Although rare, vulnerabilities in the code can lead to data leakage if not handled properly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python:** Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.
- **Django:** A recent version of Django (e.g., 4.0 or higher).
- **PostgreSQL:** A PostgreSQL database server installed and running.
- **Psycopg2:** The PostgreSQL adapter for Python. Install using `pip install psycopg2-binary`.

## Setting up Your Django Project

Let's start by creating a new Django project:

```plaintext
django-admin startproject tenant_app
cd tenant_app
python manage.py startapp core
```

This creates a Django project named `tenant_app` and a Django app named `core`. We'll use the `core` app to house our tenant-related logic.

## Database Configuration

Configure your Django project to use PostgreSQL. Open `tenant_app/settings.py` and update the `DATABASES` setting:

```plaintext
# tenant_app/settings.py

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'tenant_database',  # Replace with your database name
        'USER': 'tenant_user',        # Replace with your database user
        'PASSWORD': 'tenant_password',   # Replace with your database password
        'HOST': 'localhost',          # Replace with your database host
        'PORT': '5432',              # Replace with your database port
    }
}
```

**Important:** Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.

Create the database and user in PostgreSQL using the `psql` command-line tool:

```sql
-- Connect to the postgres database as a superuser
psql -U postgres

-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE tenant_database;

-- Create the user
CREATE USER tenant_user WITH PASSWORD 'tenant_password';

-- Grant the user permissions on the database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tenant_database TO tenant_user;

-- Optionally, set the default search path for the user (highly recommended)
ALTER ROLE tenant_user SET search_path TO '$user', public;

-- Exit psql
\q
```

Setting the default search path ensures that when the `tenant_user` connects, it searches its own schema (named after the username) before searching the `public` schema. This is important for preventing naming conflicts.

## Creating the Tenant Model

Create a `Tenant` model in your `core/models.py` file. This model will store information about each tenant, including the schema name.

```plaintext
# core/models.py
from django.db import models

class Tenant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    schema_name = models.CharField(max_length=63, unique=True)  # PostgreSQL schema name limit is 63 characters

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Register the model in your `core/admin.py` file to manage tenants through the Django admin:

```plaintext
# core/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Tenant

admin.site.register(Tenant)
```

## Implementing Schema Creation

We'll need a function to create the PostgreSQL schema when a new tenant is created. Create a file called `core/utils.py` and add the following:

```plaintext
# core/utils.py
from django.db import connection

def create_tenant_schema(schema_name):
    """
    Creates a new PostgreSQL schema.
    """
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(f'CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "{schema_name}"')
        # Optionally, grant usage privileges to the database user
        cursor.execute(f'GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "{schema_name}" TO tenant_user')
        cursor.execute(f'GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA "{schema_name}" TO tenant_user')
```

Now, let's connect the schema creation to the `Tenant` model's `save` method using Django signals. In your `core/apps.py`, configure the app ready method:

```plaintext
# core/apps.py
from django.apps import AppConfig


class CoreConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'core'

    def ready(self):
        import core.signals
```

Create a file `core/signals.py`:

```plaintext
# core/signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import Tenant
from .utils import create_tenant_schema

@receiver(post_save, sender=Tenant)
def create_schema_on_tenant_creation(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        create_tenant_schema(instance.schema_name)
```

Ensure that the `core` app is listed in your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```plaintext
# tenant_app/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'core', # Add the core app
]
```

Make migrations and migrate:

```plaintext
python manage.py makemigrations core
python manage.py migrate
```

You can now create tenants through the Django admin. Each time you create a new tenant, the corresponding schema will be created in your PostgreSQL database.

## Implementing the Tenant-Aware Middleware

The core of schema isolation lies in the middleware. This middleware will dynamically set the database schema based on the current tenant. Create a file called `core/middleware.py`:

```plaintext
# core/middleware.py
from django.db import connection
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from .models import Tenant

def set_schema(schema_name):
    """
    Sets the database schema for the current connection.
    """
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(f'SET search_path TO "{schema_name}", public') # Always include public

class TenantMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        # 1. Determine the tenant (example: from the hostname)
        hostname = request.get_host().split(':')[0]  # Remove port if present

        try:
            tenant = Tenant.objects.get(name=hostname)  # Using the name as the hostname, adjust as needed
            request.tenant = tenant # Add tenant to the request object
        except Tenant.DoesNotExist:
            # Handle the case where the tenant is not found.
            # You might redirect to a default page, show an error, or use a default schema.
            # This example uses the public schema as a fallback.
            set_schema('public') # Fallback to the public schema if no tenant found
            request.tenant = None # Add tenant to the request object

            return self.get_response(request)

        # 2. Set the schema for the current request
        set_schema(tenant.schema_name)

        response = self.get_response(request)
        return response
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`set_schema(schema_name)` function:** This function sets the PostgreSQL `search_path` for the current database connection. The `search_path` determines the order in which PostgreSQL searches for tables and other database objects. Including `public` ensures that you can still access shared resources in the `public` schema.

2.  **`TenantMiddleware`:** This middleware intercepts every request.

    - It determines the tenant based on the request. In this example, we're using the hostname. **Important:** You'll likely need to adapt this to your specific application. Other common methods include:
      - Subdomains (e.g., `tenant1.example.com`, `tenant2.example.com`)
      - URL prefixes (e.g., `/tenant1/`, `/tenant2/`)
      - A specific header (e.g., `X-Tenant-Id`)
    - It retrieves the `Tenant` object from the database.
    - It calls `set_schema()` to set the appropriate schema for the current request.
    - **Error Handling:** If the tenant is not found, it's crucial to have robust error handling. Here, we default to the 'public' schema. This is a basic example; you might redirect to a custom error page, log the error, or take other appropriate actions.
    - **Adding Tenant to Request:** The line `request.tenant = tenant` makes the tenant object available in your views, making it easier to access tenant-specific data and logic.

Add the middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting in `settings.py`. **Make sure it is placed early in the list, before any middleware that accesses the database**:

```plaintext
# tenant_app/settings.py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'core.middleware.TenantMiddleware',  # Add the tenant middleware
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]
```

## Creating Tenant-Specific Models

Now, let's create a model that will be isolated within each tenant's schema. Create a model in `core/models.py`:

```plaintext
# core/models.py
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='products')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

**Important:** Notice the `tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='products')` field. This creates a link between the `Product` and the `Tenant`. This is essential to ensure that each product belongs to a specific tenant and that you can easily query products for a given tenant. You might not need this FK in all your models, it depends on the use case.

**Migrating Tenant-Specific Models**

The standard `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` commands will run migrations in the public schema. We need to run migrations _within each tenant's schema_. We'll create a custom management command for this.

Create a directory `core/management/commands/`. Inside this directory, create a file named `migrate_tenant.py`:

```plaintext
# core/management/commands/migrate_tenant.py
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.core.management import call_command
from core.models import Tenant
from core.middleware import set_schema

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Runs migrations for a specific tenant schema.'

    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        parser.add_argument('tenant_name', nargs='?', type=str, help='The name of the tenant to migrate. If omitted, migrate all tenants.')

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        tenant_name = options['tenant_name']

        if tenant_name:
            try:
                tenant = Tenant.objects.get(name=tenant_name)
                self.migrate_tenant(tenant)
            except Tenant.DoesNotExist:
                self.stdout.write(self.style.ERROR(f"Tenant '{tenant_name}' not found."))
        else:
            # Migrate all tenants
            for tenant in Tenant.objects.all():
                self.migrate_tenant(tenant)

    def migrate_tenant(self, tenant):
        set_schema(tenant.schema_name)
        self.stdout.write(f"Migrating schema '{tenant.schema_name}'...")
        try:
            call_command('migrate', interactive=False) # interactive=False prevents prompts
            self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS(f"Successfully migrated schema '{tenant.schema_name}'."))
        except Exception as e:
             self.stdout.write(self.style.ERROR(f"Error migrating schema '{tenant.schema_name}': {e}"))

        # Reset to the default public schema, prevent subsequent commands targeting specific tenants
        set_schema('public')
```

Now you can run migrations for a specific tenant:

```plaintext
python manage.py migrate_tenant <tenant_name>
```

Or migrate all tenants:

```plaintext
python manage.py migrate_tenant
```

Before running either, make sure you created the migrations for the `Product` model:

```plaintext
python manage.py makemigrations core
```

## Tenant-Aware Views

Let's create a simple view to display products for the current tenant. Add this to `core/views.py`:

```plaintext
# core/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Product

def product_list(request):
    # tenant = request.tenant  # The tenant is already available in the request
    # products = Product.objects.filter(tenant=tenant)  # Fetch products specific to the tenant
    products = Product.objects.all() # fetches all the product specific to the tenant
    return render(request, 'core/product_list.html', {'products': products})
```

Create a template `core/templates/core/product_list.html`:

```plaintext
{# core/templates/core/product_list.html #}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Products</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Products</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for product in products %}
      <li>{{ product.name }} - ${{ product.price }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

Finally, add a URL pattern to `tenant_app/urls.py`:

```plaintext
# tenant_app/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from core import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('products/', views.product_list, name='product_list'),
]
```

## Testing the Implementation

1.  Create a few tenants through the Django admin.
2.  Run `python manage.py migrate_tenant` to migrate all schemas.
3.  Create some products through the Django admin, making sure to associate each product with the correct tenant.
4.  Run the Django development server (`python manage.py runserver`).
5.  Access the product list view (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/products/`) through different hostnames (e.g., `http://tenant1.localhost:8000/products/`, `http://tenant2.localhost:8000/products/`). You'll need to configure your `/etc/hosts` file (or equivalent) to point these hostnames to `127.0.0.1`. Ensure that the `name` field of the `Tenant` model matches the hostname used in your request.

You should see only the products associated with the corresponding tenant.

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

- **Database User Permissions:** Carefully manage database user permissions to prevent tenants from accessing other tenants' schemas.
- **Security:** Always sanitize user input and follow security best practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Performance:** Monitor database performance and optimize queries to ensure scalability. Indexing properly is very important when dealing with this kind of architecture.
- **Backup and Restore:** Develop a backup and restore strategy that allows you to back up and restore individual tenant schemas or the entire database.
- **Data Migration:** Plan for data migration when you need to update the schema or migrate data between tenants.
- **Shared Resources:** Carefully manage shared resources (e.g., users, authentication) to ensure consistency and security. Consider using a separate "public" schema for shared data.
- **Tenant Identification:** Choose a reliable method for identifying tenants (hostname, subdomain, URL prefix, header) and ensure it's consistent throughout your application.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your implementation to ensure data isolation and functionality.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where a tenant is not found or other errors occur.
- **Database Connection Pooling:** Use a database connection pooler (like PgBouncer) to improve performance, especially under high load.
- **Celery Integration:** Using a Celery, you might want to set the schema on the celery worker for each task.

## Advanced Topics

- **Dynamic Schema Creation:** Automate the creation of schemas during tenant registration using APIs or custom management commands.
- **Tenant-Specific Settings:** Allow tenants to customize settings (e.g., themes, email configurations) using a tenant-specific settings table.
- **Data Seeding:** Provide a mechanism to seed initial data into each tenant's schema when it's created.
- **Schema Versioning:** Implement a schema versioning system to manage schema changes and data migrations.

## Conclusion

Shared database, schema isolation is a powerful technique for building multi-tenant Django applications. By carefully implementing the steps outlined in this guide, you can create a scalable, secure, and cost-effective SaaS platform. Remember to prioritize security, performance, and robust error handling to ensure a smooth and reliable experience for your tenants. Always thoroughly test your implementation, and monitor performance and security closely as your application grows.
